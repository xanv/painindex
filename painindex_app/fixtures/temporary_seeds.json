      "description": "The Southern fire ant, Solenopsis xyloni, is a stinging fire ant native to southern parts of the United States.[1] Its behavior is similar to the red imported fire ant (S. invicta), although its sting is less painful.

This characteristic allows them to successfully invade the nests of their prey and also helps them retain moisture. (Source: Wikipedia)"

      "description": "These species have lance-like stingers with small barbs, and typically sting repeatedly,[1] though occasionally a stinger becomes lodged and pulls free of the wasp's body; the venom, like most bee and wasp venoms, is primarily only dangerous to humans who are allergic or are stung many times. All species have yellow or white on their faces. (Source: Wikipedia)"

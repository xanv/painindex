{"harvester ant": ["https://www.google.com/search?num=20&q=harvester+ant", [["Harvester ant - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvester_ant", "Harvester ants is a common name for any of the species or genera of ants that collect seeds (called seed predation), or mushrooms as in the case of Euprenolepis procera, which are stored in the nest in communal chambers called granaries. Seed harvesting by some desert ants is an adaptation to the lack of typical ant resources such as prey or honeydew from homopterans. Harvester ants increase seed dispersal, protection, and provide nutrients that increase seedling survivorship of the desert plants. In addition, ants provide soil aeration through the creation of galleries and chambers, mix deep and upper layers of soil, and incorporate organic refuse into the soil.[1]\n\n\nAnts may play an important role in the dynamics of plant communities by acting either as seed dispersal agents or as seed predators, or both. During the day, these ants search the savannas for vegetation and plant seeds, and carry them along back to their nest. There are two main mechanisms through which ants disperse seeds. One is myrmecochory, or seed dispersal mediated by the elaiosome, i.e., a lipid-rich seed appendage that mainly attracts non-granivorous ants and provides rewards for seed dispersal. The other one is diszoochory, or seed dispersal performed by seed-harvesting ants that is not mediated by any particular seed structure. While the former has traditionally been recognized mainly as a mutualism, the latter is usually perceived as an antagonism.[2]\nHarvester ants foraging in hot, dry conditions lose water, but obtain water from metabolizing fats in the seeds that they eat. Positive feedback on foraging activity, from returning foragers with food, allows the colony to regulate its foraging activity according to the current costs of desiccation and the benefits based on current food availability.[3]\nIn many harvester ant species, foraging behavior is influenced by the weather. For example, in the ant Messor andrei, recruitment to food bait is higher in more humid conditions. Both humidity and food availability are affected by day to day changes in weather conditions. Food is distributed by wind and flooding and rain uncovers seeds in the top layer of the soil. In Pogonomyrmex barbatus, daily changes in conditions such as humidity and food availability produce strong daily trends in the foraging activity of all colonies.[4]\nColonies may vary in the relation between humidity and foraging activity. Colonies differ consistently from year to year in how often they forage at all and most colonies forage on days with high humidity and high food availability, such as those just after a rain when flooding has exposed a layer of seeds in the soil. Few colonies forage on very dry days. Colonies also differ in how likely they are to adjust the rate of outgoing foragers to the rate of forager return. While all colonies tend to adjust outgoing foraging rate closely when conditions are good, only some colonies do so in poor conditions.[5]"], ["Red harvester ant - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_harvester_ant", "Pogonomyrmex barbatus is a species of harvester ant from the genus Pogonomyrmex. Its common names include red ant and red harvester ant.[1] These large (5\u20137 millimeters) ants prefer arid chaparral habitats and are native to the southwest United States.[2] Nests are made underground (up to 2.5 meters deep) in exposed areas. Their diets consist primarily of seeds, and they consequently participate in myrmecochory, an ant-plant interaction through which the ants gain nutrients and the plants benefit through seed dispersal. Red harvester ants are often mistaken for fire ants, but are not closely related to any fire ant species, native or introduced.\n\n\nRed harvester ant nests are characterized by a lack of plant growth and small pebbles surrounding the entrance to the tunnel, which usually descends at a pronounced angle. Hulls of seeds may however be found scattered around the nest. In grassland areas, such as ranches, the lack of plant life makes red harvester ant colonies very easy to spot, and where they are very plentiful they may make serious inroads into the grazing available to livestock.\nThe mounds are typically flat and broad, 0 to 100\u00a0mm (0.0 to 3.9\u00a0in) high, and 300 to 1,200\u00a0mm (12 to 47\u00a0in) in diameter. There have been reports of even larger denuded areas, on the order of 10\u00a0m2 (110\u00a0sq\u00a0ft). Three to eight trails typically lead away from the mound, like \"arms\". These trails are used by ants to collect and bring food back to the mound. \"Scout\" ants are the first ones out of the mound every morning. They seek food, and mark their path as they return to the mound to alert the worker ants. The worker ants follow the scent trail and collect the food. Other worker ants clean, extend and generally tend to the mound, the queen and the brood. All the ants in the colonies are females apart from the winged males produced in the breeding season.\nThe reproductive unit of ant populations is the colony. A single virgin queen first mates with several males at a reproductive aggregation site formed by male harvester ants. She then flies to a new site to produce an offspring colony.[3]\nThe main food source for red harvester ants usually consists of seeds, which they hoard in great numbers. The food is first ground to a bread-like consistency using the ant's large mandible, and is then stored in a granary, assuring the colony access to food year-round. Seed collection on behalf of the red harvester ants benefits their ecosystem through the process of myrmecochory, in which ants aid in the dispersal of seeds while foraging for food. Both plant and ant benefit from this relationship: the plants increase their dispersal range and density, while the ants benefit from acquiring nutrients and ensuring a more secure food supply in future harvests. This is typically understood as a mutualistic interaction. Dead insects are also collected during foraging.\nMuch research has been done on the foraging behavior of the red harvester ant. Three types of workers are most involved in the foraging process: nest patrollers, trail patrollers, and foragers. On a given day, nest patrollers emerge first from the nest to assess the safety and profitability of foraging. The colony gets the majority of its water from the metabolism of the fats in seeds.[4] If food is scarce, or if it is a particularly hot day, the energy and water benefits of foraging may be outweighed by its energy and water costs. In this case, the colony may be forced to rely on its extensive food stores. Seeds may be stored in the nest for months or even several years.[5]\nThe colony is able to communicate through momentary antennal contact involving the transfer of cuticular hydrocarbons.[6] Other visual, temporal, and olfactory cues may also be involved.[6] Based on the nest patrollers\u2019 reports, trail patrollers may leave the nest to determine the best possible foraging direction. This decision is based upon various economic factors such as food availability and neighboring nests\u2019 foraging behavior. As both types of patrollers return, foragers assess their rates of return to decide whether to leave the nest to find food. In an experiment involving patroller mimics, it was found that a return rate of 1 patroller every 10 seconds stimulated the highest level of foraging activity.[6] This return rate indicates high availability of food and good foraging conditions, and therefore a favorable cost-benefit ratio for the foragers. If the patroller return rate is too high, it may be a warning of danger, such as the sighting of a predatory lizard. A lower return rate could indicate lack of available food, or heavy competition.\nAnt foraging is guided by chemical signals that lead the ants up to 50\u201360\u00a0km (?) from the nest at times.[7][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] Once an ant has decided to forage, it will almost always continue until it has found food to take back to the nest. 90% of returning foragers are \u201csuccessful\u201d.[8] Therefore, forager return rate is a good indicator of food availability. Logically, overall foraging activity is influenced by the rate of returning foragers.[8] When food is plentiful, foragers will quickly find it and immediately return to the nest. Foragers still in the nest will interpret this to mean food searches will be profitable: low energy input with a high chance of a seed reward. Foraging activity will consequently be increased. Likewise, a decline in food availability, indicated by a decrease in forager return rate, will cause the colony to decrease its foraging activity.[6]\nThe ability for a colony to quickly regulate its foraging behavior is quite important since their food source is variable and scattered. This regulatory ability is variable in itself, influenced by food availability, current need to eat, and colony health.[2] Colonies are more likely to adapt to varying forager return rates when the rate of foraging is high, which may be because variances are simply harder to detect during low rates.[2] Overall, the red harvester ant demonstrates a remarkable ability in social cognition, cost-benefit analysis, and behavioral economics.\nHarvester ant populations operate without a centralized control system by means of a decentralized chemical communication system, through the process of chemical signalling. Foraging is regulated using positive and negative feedback loops. When ants return to the colony, this stimulates outgoing foraging. When ants return to the colony at a higher rate with seeds, this in turn causes the outgoing rate of foragers to increase. As fewer ants bearing seeds return to the colony, the rate of outgoing foragers decreases. The result is foraging regulation relative to the abundance of available food at any given time.[9] The interactions between returning and outgoing foragers operates on a timescale of seconds. It typically only took three to eight seconds for an outgoing forager to leave the nest as a result of an increase in successful returning foragers.[10]\nRelative abundance of food available is gauged by the average time spent foraging per seed, rather than the distance traveled to find each seed. Foragers take less time when food is more abundant. Faster foraging signals faster rates of outgoing foragers, maximizing the harvest of food relative to the abundance in the area. Seeds are used as a source of water for ants, and are often kept in the nest for anywhere from a few months to multiple years.[11]\nInterspecies competition exists between harvester ant populations, presenting challenges to successful foraging. One example of this is the competition for access to seed resources between the Novomessor cockerelli and Pogonomyrmex barbatus species of harvester ants. Novomessor cockerelli ants engage in interference competition against Pogonomyrmex barbatus colonies by \"plugging\" entrances to the nest with sand and small rocks. This delays activity of P. barbatus for anywhere from one to three hours, shifting the onset of foraging until later in the day when the temperature is substantially higher. This reduces productivity in two ways; firstly, the ants are delayed and consequently have less time to forage; secondly, high soil temperatures prematurely drive harvest ants back into their nests, shortening the range of possible foraging. Research indicated that the affected Pogonomyrmex barbatus populations did not take efforts to compensate for the interference in their activities, such as by inducing higher rates of foraging. As such, nest plugging by rival species impedes the overall productivity of worker ants in the species Pogonomyrmex barbatus.[12]\nRed harvester ants are eusocial insects, characterized by a high-level of cooperation and an organized division of labor. The worker caste is sterile. As with most ant species, reproduction is performed by a mating caste that consists of winged alates (reproductives) that reside in the nest until weather permits them to fly away and mate. After copulation the male usually dies, while the now-fertilized queen returns to the ground to search for a suitable nesting site. Once she has chosen a site, she sheds her wings and begins to reproduce, creating a new colony. She produces \"worker ants\" for 1\u201320 years until her death. Some Queens have been known to live up to 30 years in the wild.\nIn Pogonomyrmex barbatus, reproductive and non-reproductive tasks are divided into a caste system, as discussed above. Some individuals are specialized for reproductive function while other ants are responsible for non-reproductive roles such as defense, caring for the brood, and foraging for food. Research indicates that the system of division of labor naturally arises in conjunction with the formation of the group, rather than as a secondary adaptation; this was demonstrated by an experiment in which otherwise solitary queen harvest ants were placed in forced association. The results of the study indicated that divisions of labor arose in groups that lack an evolutionary history of such social arrangements.[13]\nWithin non-reproductive Pogonomyrmex barbatus worker ants, five major tasks are performed: foraging, maintenance of the nest, defense, midden work, and convening. Roles are not constant and chemical interactions determine when certain ants engage in certain activities. As such, these tasks are relatively fluid and cannot be understood as separate processes. The transition in behavior on behalf of one group triggers behavioral transitions in other groups of worker ants.[14]\nThe reproductive Pogonomyrmex barbatus caste are responsible for the formation of new colonies. A single queen ant establishes every colony. Large numbers of winged male ants and virgin queen ants fly to mating aggregation sites following mid-summer monsoon rains. In order to found a successful colony, Pogonomyrmex barbatus queens must mate with males from two separate lineages. One lineage results in ants that will become the workers of the colony. These are the ants responsible for the non-reproductive tasks of the colony, including: foraging for food, building and defending the nest, and brood care. The other lineage produces reproductive female ants. After mating with the male ants at the aggregation site, the queen flies away to establish a new colony. Upon arriving at her new nest site, the queen loses her wings and builds a nest in the soil. The entrance into the nest is then sealed off in order to lay her eggs in safety. With this, the colony is born. Over the course of the following six to eight weeks, the primary brood of non-reproductive worker ants emerges and begins to forage and build the colony.[15]\nMating is perennial and species-specific between sub-species of the Red Harvester Ant. Males distinguish reproductive females of their species from females of other species using pheromones. This occurs as a result of sexually stimulating pheromones secreted from the poison-glands of reproductive Pogonomyrmex barbatus females. These pheromones are perfectly detected by males of the species upon physical contact, resulting in the stimulation of sexual behavior.\nMating occurs at reproductive aggregation sites. Secretions from the mandibular glands of males initially mark these sites. The secretions attract females, as well as additional males, resulting in strong male competition for mates. The system of mating within the Pogonomyrmex barbatus species is comparable to lek behavior performed by many vertebrate species. The male ants congregate and collectively give off a pheromone that attracts reproductive females. The more males present to give off the pheromone, the stronger the attraction for the females. Although this practice strongly favors certain males and leaves many others without mates, the congregation of males attracts more females on the whole as opposed to pheromone release on behalf of a solitary male. Consequently, it is more desirable for the less attractive males to remain in the lek than to attempt to attract females on their own.[16]\nWithin reproductive aggregations of Pogonomyrmex barbatus ants, strong male competition exists. Male harvester ants engage in communal mating displays in order to attract females. Male ants will attempt to mate with any female they encounter, but females resist copulation from the males. Consequently, the communal mating displays heavily favor reproduction with larger or more persistent males who are able to overpower the females and successfully copulate. The male ants will copulate for as long as possible, likely to restrict access to the female from other males to ensure their sperm survives to reproduce.[17]\nRed harvester ants are a favorite food for desert horned lizards. Harvester ants will defend their colonies vigorously against real or perceived attacks, whether by large or small animals. They may bite ferociously and their stings are venomous and painful. The effect spreads through the lymphatic system, sometimes causing dangerous reactions, especially in animals sensitive or allergic to their venom.\nOver the years, their numbers have been declining, and this has often been attributed to competition for food with the invasive red imported fire ant and the Argentine ant. Their decline has affected many native species, especially those for which the red harvester ant is a chief source of food, such as the Texas horned lizard.\nRed harvester ants are commonly used in captive ant ecologies (the so-called, \"Ant Farm\", which is a trademark of Uncle Milton, Inc.). Their large size and foraging habits, coupled with an inability to climb the glass walls of the enclosures used, make the species an excellent choice for this role."], ["Harvester Ant Behavior: Characteristics of Harvester Ants", "http://www.orkin.com/ants/harvester-ant/", "Share this page:\nPogonomyrmex spp.\nThe Western harvester ant is found in the west at high elevations. This is a red colored ant that can be 6.5 to 10 mm long. Galleries have been found to go over 600 cm deep.\nThe three common species of harvester ants\u2014the red, western and California harvester ants\u2014each have unique behaviors, castes and tasks, feeding, nesting patterns and defense mechanisms. The harvester ant behavior differs between each species, seen through their feeding and nesting habits. In addition, unlike many other ants that infest indoor structures, all species of harvester ants prefer not to invade houses and buildings, but will establish their nests around gardens or yards, often destroying vegetation.\nThe red harvester ants can be aggressive. They deliver a painful sting. Sometimes, the stings of harvester ants can cause allergic reactions, especially to those sensitive to their venom. Aside from their powerful stings, harvester ants also bite viciously.\nThis is an important agricultural pest in many areas. The feeding habits of red harvester ants can be seen as they leave their nests and travel to their food sources, leaving a distinct scent throughout their paths.\nColonies usually contain a single queen who is responsible for producing the eggs. Winged reproductives, also called swarmer or alates, are produced in the summer. Males die soon after mating with the females, who go on to found new colonies.\nAside from the ants themselves, the large mounds, almost 53 inches across in some cases,\u00a0and denuded\u00a0vegetation\u00a0near to the nest are the most visible signs of harvester ant activity.\nThe answer to this question is YES, harvester ants are poisonous.  In general, the harvester ants in the genus Pogonomyrmex are aggressive biters that inject potent and painful venom with their stingers.   Like most stinging insects, their level of aggression and venom potency differs between species within the genus.  For example, the Florida harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex badius, is not considered an aggressive ant, but its venomous sting is very painful.\nWestern Harvester Ants\nBlack Harvester Ants\nTexas Red Harvester Ants\nRed Harvester Ant Mating Swarms\n\n\t\tGive us a call:\n        \n844-514-3980\n\n\nOr schedule a call with an Orkin Specialist today and get a FREE estimate for:\n\n\t\tThis branch appears close by:\n\t\t\n\n,  \n\n\nNot in ?\n\t\tEnter a zip code below to view local branches.\nLearn to identify this pest with these helpful pictures.\n\u00a0\nSee more photos here \n\u00a0"], ["Florida harvester ant - Pogonomyrmex badius", "http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/creatures/urban/ants/harvester_ant.htm", "Although the Florida harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex badius (Latreille), occurs throughout most\r\n  of Florida it is limited by its ecological requirements.  Where it does occur, the ant nest is\r\n  readily visible as a large cleared area with a number of slow moving individuals on the surface\r\n  near the nest. Harvester ants in the genus Pogonomyrmex received this name due to their\r\n  practice of gathering seeds for food. While there are 22 species of harvester ants found in the\r\n  United States, only the Florida harvester ant occurs east of the Mississippi River (Smith and\r\n  Whitman 1992). \n\nFigure 1. Major worker of the Florida harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex  badius (Latreille). Photograph by Lyle J. Buss, University of  Florida.\n  The Florida harvester ant is found from Florida to North Carolina (Haack and Granovsky\r\n  1990) and west into Mississippi (Creighton 1950) and Louisiana (Cole 1968).  The ant is the\r\n  only eastern representative of the genus Pogonomyrmex (Cole 1968).\r\n\n  The adults are dark rust red in color (Haack and Granovsky 1990), with the worker caste\r\n  strongly polymorphic (1/4 to 3/8 inch long) (Smith and Whitman 1992). The major worker has\r\n  a disproportionally enlarged head (after Creighton 1950).\r\n\nLike most other Pogonomyrmex spp. the Florida harvester ant has a psammophore (rows of\r\n  long hair on ventral side of head) but it is poorly developed (Smith and Whitman 1992).  \r\n  The antennae are clubless with twelve segments. The thoracic dorsum has the sutures\r\n  obsolescent or absent,  and the thorax is not impressed between the masonotum and epinotum; \r\n  The abdominal pedicel consists of two segments.  The tibial spurs on the middle and hind legs\r\n  are very finely pectinate. \n \nFigure 2. Harvester ant worker, Pogonomyrmex badius (Latreille). Drawing by Division of Plant Industry. \n  The Florida harvester ant differs from all other Pogonomyrmex spp. in having polymorphic\r\n  (more than one size)  workers. The huge headed soldiers (major workers) are not abundant in\r\n  the colonies and seem to be no more aggressive or pugnacious than the intermediate and\r\n  smaller workers (Wheeler 1910).\r\n\nThe Florida harvester ant nests exclusively or by preference in sand.  It requires open areas in\r\n  which to build its nest and tends to nest in open woodlands or grassy areas (Haack and\r\n  Granovsky 1990).  Xeric hammocks are preferred.  Many nests are found on lawns, around\r\n  gardens, and in fire lanes (Van Pelt 1958).  The mound is very slight and flattened with single\r\n  or multiple entrances in the center and is from 30 to 60 cm in diameter.  Unlike most other\r\n  harvester ant species (Haack and Granovsky 1990), Florida harvester ant workers make no\r\n  effort to clear vegetation from around the mound (Wheeler 1910). However, the mound is\r\n  often covered with small pebbles or charcoal from burned areas (Smith and Whitman 1992). \n\nFigure 3. Colony entrance of the Florida harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex badius (Latreille). Photograph by Lyle J. Buss,  University of Florida.\nThe ant is vigorously active in rather low relative humidity (below 55 percent) and in high\r\n  temperatures (35-40\u00b0C). Mating swarms usually occur in the afternoon after a rain (Haack and\r\n  Granovsky 1990). Winged forms (reproductive adults) have been observed in the nests in\r\n  May, and mating flights were recorded for June (Van Pelt 1958).  Haack and Granovsky\r\n  (1990) state that harvester ants swarm from June to October although the swarms are more\r\n  common during August and September. Colonies are long lived and one was observed to last\r\n  at least 19 years (Haack and Granovsky 1990). There is a single queen in each colony (Smith\r\n  and Whitman 1992). \nThe ant harvests the seeds of many plants and stores them in the flat graneries of its nest which\r\n  consists of many subterranean tunnels and chambers (Haack and Granovsky 1990, Tschinkel\r\n  2001).  It not only collects seeds that have fallen to the ground, but also plucks them directly\r\n  from the plants, husks them and deposits the chaff on the kitchen middens at the periphery of\r\n  the mound.  Seeds from the following plants have been identified from nests: ragweed, crab grass, small crab grass, rough buttonweed, sedge, Paspalium sp., poke weed, red clover, alfalfa, evening primrose, narrow leaf vetch and crotonweed. \n\nFigure 4. Foraging Florida harvester ants, Pogonomyrmex  badius (Latreille). Photograph by Lyle J. Buss, University of  Florida. \nThe Florida harvester ant moves its nest periodically (an average of once every 234 days) in\r\n  response to changes in microclimate resulting from shading due to overhanging vegetation. Pogonomyrmex workers of one colony will readily fight members of another colony of the same or different ant\r\n  species and continued strife of this kind also results in colony movement (Smith and Whitman\r\n  1992). \n  The Florida harvester ant is not of economic importance to growers and homeowners, is not\r\n  aggressive and almost has to be forced to sting someone. However, the sting is among the\r\n  more painful of those received from ants and the pain lasts longer than usual for ant stings due\r\n  to the poison injected (Haack and Granovsky 1990). Some swelling may also occur as the\r\n  reaction to their stings spread along the lymph channels (Ebeling 1978).\r\n\nA personal account of a sting episode by Wray (1938) is as follows:  \"Several ants stung me\r\n  on the wrist, and after a few minutes an intense fiery pain began in this area which was about\r\n  two inches in diameter.  It turned deep red in color and immediately a watery, sticky secretion\r\n  came out of the skin.  This area became hot and feverish and the excruciating pain lasted all\r\n  day and up into the night.\" At least one death, a child in Oklahoma, has been credited to stings\r\n  by the red harvester ant, P. barbatus (Haack and Granovsky 1990). \n  Generally, management of the Florida harvester ant isn't necessary unless the ant is located\r\n  where small children may be playing or in other similar circumstances.  An adult may easily\r\n  avoid the ant, thus avoiding the extremely painful sting. The Florida harvester ant uses odor\r\n  trials as well as sun orientation to return to food sources (Ebeling 1978) so placing baits on\r\n  these trails may help control a colony. Mounds should be treated during the hottest part of the\r\n  day, as the ants are least active at this time, by injecting a labeled insecticidal dust into the\r\n  entrance (Smith and Whitman 1992).  Insect growth regulators are also recommended, but\r\n  take longer to destroy the colony.\r\n\nIn the event that management is necessary, see the following University of Florida\r\n  recommendations: \nInsect Management Guide for ants \nAnt Trails: a Key to Management with Baits "], ["Harvester Ants - DesertUSA", "http://www.desertusa.com/mag07/jul07/ant.html", "Southwest Adventure, Living & Travel\nFollow DesertUSA\nEnter E-Mail address:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStrangely, ants in general, and harvester ants in particular \u0096 seemingly small and humble creatures that live in dark chambers beneath the floors of our deserts \u0096 have long stirred the human imagination.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\nFor a video on the Harvester Ants- click here\nFor instance, in the mythology of the Pimas \u0096 a tribe of the northern Sonoran Desert and probable descendents of the Hohokam Puebloan tradition \u0096 a solid sphere of ants served as the raw material from which the Creator made the entire earth, according to Natalie Curtis in her The Indians\u2019 Book.\u00a0\nIn the folklore of the Isleta Puebloans \u0096 a community of the northernmost Chihuahuan Desert and cultural descendents of the Anasazi Puebloan tradition \u0096 Big Red Ants and Little Black Ants rescued Corn-stalk Young Man from a bewitched tree so that he could save his starving village from a crippling drought, according Charles F.

Northwest Indian peoples \u0096 the harvester ants, or \u201cbig pinching ants,\u201d had to be placated by elaborate ritual if someone dared to disturb their mound, according to Stephen Welton Taber in The World of the Harvester Ants.\u00a0 \nIn a large body of work by modern scientists \u0096 very bright people who try to understand our world \u0096 harvester ants have become something of a legend because they raise baffling questions that almost seem to extend into the realm of mysticism.\u00a0\nSocietal Riddles\nIn a way that mystifies the human mind, which has the inclination to institute leadership, delegate responsibilities, organize resources and set schedules to carry out tasks, a colony of harvester ants (like colonies of other ant species) operates perfectly well in the absence of any apparent central control or organizing force, according to Deborah Gordon, Ants at Work.\u00a0 A queen mother, who serves as a well-maintained egg-laying machine rather than a royal sovereign, founds a colony of harvester ants, which may grow to 10,000 to 20,000 individuals.\u00a0 With no evident guiding hand, worker ants \u0096 all female children of the queen \u0096 go about the complex business of tending their mother, protecting her eggs, nurturing their baby sisters, pampering reproductive sisters and brothers, excavating and maintaining labyrinthine chambers, harvesting and storing food seeds, grooming themselves and defending their colony.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nIn another unexplained phenomenon, all neighboring harvester ant colonies of the same species \u0096 with no obvious prior communications, coordination or cue among them \u0096 emerge from their burrows on a single climactic spring or summer day each year to send swarms of young winged would-be queens with their winged male consorts swarming into the desert air, on missions to breed and establish new homes.\u00a0 In some puzzling way, all the colonies know the appointed moment.\u00a0 While most, including all the males, soon die because of exposure to the desert environment, starvation outside the nurturing colony, or predation by various gluttonous ant lovers, a few lucky females, probably less than one percent, will manage to find new homes and establish new colonies, beginning with tiny burrows they excavate into the soil.\u00a0 The new queen carries within her the sperm from several different males.\nThe Ant\nHopefully, a harvester ant, which may belong to any of several black to reddish-brown harvester ant species in the Southwest, will not introduce itself to you with

sweating, faintness, nausea and piloerection (hair standing on end), according to Taber.\u00a0\nThe sting may make you mad, too.\u00a0\nClosely related to the wasp and the bee, according to Floyd Werner and Carl Olson, Insects of the Southwest, the typical harvester ant measures about three-eighths of an inch in length.\u00a0 It has \u201ca basket of long setae on the underside of the head\u201d that it uses to carry soil when excavating and cleaning its nest.\u00a0\nA colony signals its presence by clearing all vegetation surrounding the entrance to its nest, leaving a barren flat

underground storerooms.\u00a0 They may also prey on insects, especially termites, if they can find and catch them.\u00a0 They forego water altogether, depending on humidity within their nest for moisture.\u00a0\nThe Colony\nA colony begins fortuitously when one of the few winged and fully-mated females, or queens, to survive an annual flight manages to establish a small burrow, most likely in an open area.\u00a0 \u201cThe first thing [any new queen ant] does,\u201d said William Atherton DuPuy in Our Insect Friends and Foes, \u201cis to tear off her wings, which she never expects to use again now that she had made her marriage flight.\u201d\u00a0 After digging the burrow several inches in depth, she lays several eggs, her very first, which \u201cbecome tiny, wormlike larvae, and finally turn into pupae, resembling ants enclosed in a papery case,\u201d said Gordon.\u00a0 \u201cWhen an ant emerges from the pupal case [after several weeks] it is an adult and does not grow any more.\u201d\u00a0 The queen, who will now spend the rest of her life in total darkness, nurtures her first young, all female ants, very carefully, from her own fat reserves.\u00a0 She may even lick them like a mother cat licks her kittens.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nWith an apparent inborn understanding of their respective roles, these ants \u0096 much smaller, for some reason, than their successors will be \u0096 set up housekeeping.\u00a0 They forage for seeds.\u00a0 They care for the next generation, working to make the fledgling colony viable before closing down for the coming fall and winter.\u00a0\nWith the arrival of spring, when the ant community reawakens, the population divides into two groups, according to Gordon.\u00a0 About three quarters of the ants \u0096 all females \u0096 will operate primarily in the depths of the nest.\u00a0 Some of these ants care for the queen, the sole, vital source of eggs for the colony.\u00a0 Some nurture new larvae.\u00a0 Others excavate new chambers to accommodate their growing numbers.\u00a0 Others store food in designated spaces.\u00a0 Still others maintain the nest, carrying ant trash and excavated dirt to the surface.\u00a0 Some, apparently, just hang around in case they might be needed.\u00a0 The remaining quarter of the population \u0096 again, all females \u0096 stays near the surface of the nest.\u00a0 Again, by some unknown understanding, maintenance workers tidy up immediately around the entrance.\u00a0 Patrolling ants inspect the nest midden area, stop and interrogate intruding ants, and set the day\u2019s foraging courses.\u00a0 The foraging ants typically travel perhaps as much as 30 to 40 feet from the nest in their quest for food, collecting the seeds from perhaps dozens of nearby plant species.\u00a0 Meanwhile, still other maintenance workers police the midden surrounding the nest entrance.\u00a0 It appears, says Gordon, that the younger ants perform the subsurface chores, the senior ants, the surface duties.\u00a0 As ants age, they graduate from subsurface to surface duties.\nAfter about five years, when the colony typically reaches a population of about 10,000, said Gordon, the queen produces the first breeding offspring\u0097the winged would-be queens and their winged male consorts.\u00a0 In a celebration of renewal, the colony may cast its winged emissaries \u0096 called \u201calates\u201d \u0096 to the winds once every year for the nest 10 to 15 years, until the queen dies, signaling the eventual end of the colony since she is the sole producer of its eggs.\u00a0\nNest Architecture\nAs the colony grows and matures, subterranean workers expand the nest, creating an interlocking system of tunnels and galleries, according to Taber, although sometimes, \u201c\u2026part of the nest occupies a dome of earth and gravel that the ants themselves build up from excavated materials and from surface scrapings nearby.\u00a0 These mounds are the hallmark of the western harvester\u2026\u201d\nThe workers may excavate several feet in depth, to the caliche hardpan of the desert, producing a maze of tunnels a half inch in diameter and chambers several inches in breadth.\u00a0 The colony uses the chambers for the queen\u2019s housing, the nurseries, seed storage and garbage disposal.\u00a0 When workers have to repair tunnels and chambers, they transfer larvae and seeds to other, stable quarters.\u00a0 The workers may litter the mound at the entrance with the detritus of the soil, including such things as small pebbles, plant matter and, said Taber, even broken glass and nails.\u00a0 (During surveys of archaeological sites for various institutions, we have sometimes found prehistoric beads and other small artifacts on the mounds of harvester ants.)\nThe workers build a mound surrounded by a cleared surface for uncertain reasons, according to Taber, but they might construct the feature to \u0096 for example \u0096 minimize flooding of the entrance, provide a barrier to wildfires or to discourage intrusion of plant roots.\u00a0 They might even use it as a defense mechanism, denying cover to potential predators.\u00a0\nImportantly, ants \u201care the primary soil workers in the Southwest\u2026\u201d said Werner and Olson.\u00a0 \u201cTheir nest-making\u2026aerates the soil, helps retain soil moisture or drainage, and fertilizes and distributes many native plants.\u201d\nDefense of the Colony\nAlthough armed with a painful sting, the harvester ant nevertheless faces a host of unintimidated, fearsome enemies, some of them so threatening that the colony has to engage them in full-scale combat.\u00a0\nWhile the ant suffers predation by birds, amphibians, reptiles, insects, spiders and other organisms, it must see the horned lizard, the so-called \u201chorny toad,\u201d as a dragon.\u00a0 The colony that faces a horned lizard feeding on the ants near the entrance to the nest may mount a swarming attack against the menacing ogre.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cA [horned] lizard besieged but determined to stay will remain motionless as dozens of ants crawl over its scaly armor, biting and stinging as they go,\u201d said Taber.\u00a0 Unfortunately for the ants, the horned lizards have \u201can immunity or defense against ant venom in the form of a detoxifying substance in their blood plasma\u2026, and when mobbed they simply hunker down with closed eyes until the ants leave.\u201d\u00a0 The horned lizards then simply resume feeding.\u00a0 The ant colony may suffer considerable losses to a persistent lizard.\u00a0 (When I was a youngster, I once caught a horny toad and placed it at the entrance of a busy harvester ant colony in the Rolling Plains of Texas, just to see what would happen.\u00a0 The grateful creature lapped up ant after ant, presumably to the distress of the colony.)\nA harvester ant colony may also have to defend itself against competing and raiding ants of other species or even of its own species.\u00a0 (I remember seeing a colony of harvester ants at war with a force of invading ants once in the Texas Rolling Plains.\u00a0 It looked like a seething mass of enraged miniature armies in conflict.)\n \u201cWhen harvester ants fight,\u201d said Gordon, \u201cthey grab onto each other with their mandibles and hold on.\u00a0 Often each ant clamps the other\u2019s petiole, the segment that attaches the abdomen to the thorax\u2026\u00a0 Sometimes one ant succeeds in breaking the other into two pieces.\u00a0 Sometimes an ant dies while clamped on to another, but the mandibular muscles of a dead ant maintain their grip though the rest of the ant may break off.\u00a0 \u2026it is not unusual to see an ant walking around with just the head of its attacker still attached to its petiole.\u201d\nAnt Studies\n\u00a0Because of parallels with the human community, ant colonies have for centuries drawn the attention of human observers, especially the biologists, who have studied such aspects as the insects\u2019 life history, social structure, organization, individual behavior, family relationships, navigational abilities, slaving practices, memory, communications, adaptability, genetics and environmental impacts.\u00a0 Ants, according to the FOXNews.com Internet site, have even suffered the indignity of having their legs lengthened by stilts or shorted by partial amputation by researchers who wanted to see whether lengthened or shortened strides would alter the insects\u2019 calculations of distance.\u00a0\nSo far, the collective studies have shown, as a Stanford University News Release in the Stanford News Service Internet site said, \u201cAn individual ant is not very bright, but ants in a colony, operating as a collective, do remarkable things.\u201d\u00a0\nThat may have been what prompted a very wise fellow named Solomon to say in his book of Proverbs:\nGo to the ant, O sluggard;\n        consider her ways, and be wise.\n        Without having any chief,\n        officer or ruler,\n        she prepares her food in summer \n        and gathers her sustenance in\u00a0harvest.\n        How long will you lie there, O\n

Drees*\n*Professor and Extension Entomologist, The Texas A&M University System.\nRed harvester ants are one of the more noticeable and larger ants in open areas in Texas. Eleven species in this group of ants (genus Pogonomyrmex) are known from the state. However, harvester ants are not nearly as common today as they were during the earlier 1900s. The decline, particularly in the eastern part of the state, has caused some alarm because these ants serve as a major source of food for the rapidly disappearing and threatened Texas horned lizard.\nWorker ants are 1\u20444 to 1\u20442 inch long and red to dark brown. They have squarish heads and no spines on the body. There are 22 species of harvester ants in the United States, 10 of which are found in Texas. Seven of these species are found only in far west Texas.\nWinged males and females swarm, couple and mate, especially following rains. Winged forms are larger than worker ants. Males soon die and females seek a suitable nesting site. After dropping her wings, the queen ant digs a burrow and produces a few eggs. Larvae hatch from eggs and develop through several stages (instars). Larvae are white and legless, shaped like a crookneck squash with a small distinct head. Pupation occurs within a cocoon. Worker ants produced by the queen ant begin caring for other developing ants, enlarge the nest and forage for food.\n Worker ants can give a painful, stinging bite, but are generally reluctant to attack. Effects of the bite can spread along lymph channels and can be medically serious. Harvester ant workers commonly are sold for ant farms.\n Worker ants remove vegetation in circular areas or craters around nests. Colonies occur in open areas and usually have a single central opening. The area around the opening usually has small pebbles deposited on the soil surface by the worker ants. Often there is no vegetation within a 3- to 6-foot circle around the central opening of the colony, and along foraging trails radiating from the colony. Colonies usually are widely separated; however, heavy infestations in pasture and rangeland can reduce yield. Red harvester ants also colonize in ornamental turf areas where their presence may be undesirable. They do not invade homes or structures.\nRed harvester ant foragers collect seeds and dead insects and store them in the nests as food for the colony. The ants\u2019 mouthparts are designed for chewing. \nRed harvester ants are native species and are generally not considered to be serious pests. Consider the option of not controlling these ants, especially in areas inhabited by the few remaining horned lizards (see box). \n\u00a0\nHowever, in certain cases, elimination of red harvester ants may be necessary. Destruction of their nests and habitat through regular discing and mowing may eliminate them without resorting to use of insecticides. If pesticides are selected, use registered products selectively and carefully follow instructions provided on the label. \nAlthough any insecticide registered to control \u201cants\u201d can be used to control harvester ants, few are registered specifically to control these species (Table 1). Harvester ants can be quickly eliminated using Amdro\u00ae Pro Fire Ant Bait (0.73 percent hydramethylnon) or similar products. Individual colonies can be treated using 2 to 5 tablespoons of product scattered around the colony\u2019s central opening. In larger areas, the product can be broadcast at a rate of 1 to 1 1\u20442 pounds product per acre (2 to 3 ounces per 5,000 square feet) using a suitable application device such as a hand-cranked seeder or the electric-driven mountable Herd GT Model 77 Seeder. Amdro\u00ae can be used in lawns, landscaped areas, golf courses, other noncropped areas, grounds surrounding poultry houses, corrals, other animal holding areas, nonbearing ornamental nursery stock, pasture and rangeland. Do not cut and bale hay from treated cattle pastures and rangeland until 7 days after bait application.\nTable 1. Insecticide products available for treatment of harvester ants.\n\u00a0\nSuggested pesticides must be registered and\r\n    labeled for use by the Environmental\r\n    Protection Agency and the Texas Department\r\n    of Agriculture. The status of pesticide label\r\n    clearances is subject to change and may have\r\n    changed since this publication was printed.\r\n    County Extension agents and appropriate specialists\r\n    are advised of changes as they occur.    \nThe USER is always responsible for the\r\n    effects of pesticide residues on his livestock\r\n    and crops, as well as for problems that could\r\n    arise from drift or movement of the pesticides\r\n    from his property to that of others. Always\r\n    read and follow carefully the instructions on\r\n    the product label.\nIn noncrop areas, a contact insecticide such as products containing bifenthrin or acephate can be applied as directed to individual ant nests. When using Ortho Orthene\u00ae Fire Ant Killer (acephate 50 percent) apply as a dry application as directed. Other products may require water to wash the insecticide off of the dust or granular formulation and into the ant nest.\nDrees, B.M. and J.A. Jackman. A Field Guide to Common Texas Insects.

The pedicel (or stalk) between the abdomen\nand thorax has two segments. They have elaborate fringes of hairs underneath the head. As is the\ncase with other ants, adults may be winged males or females, or workers (wingless females).\nWinged ants have two pairs of wings, the anterior pair being much larger than the second\npair.\nEgg -- The eggs are minute, less than 0.5 mm long, white and elliptical in shape.\nLarvae -- The larvae are white and legless. The body is covered with short hairs and is\nshaped like a crookneck squash or gourd with a small distinct head.\nPupa -- Found in a cocoon, the pupa resemble the larva except that the body is straight\nand rigid with legs and wings visible.\n\nBIOLOGY\nDistribution -- The so-called harvester ants occur west of the Mississippi except for one\nspecies. The two most common species are the Texas harvester ant and Western harvester\nant.\nHost Plants -- The harvester ants do not consume grass for food but denude areas around\nmounds and along trails. Their principal source of food is seeds of various grasses and the flesh\nof arthropods.\nDamage -- The harvester ants not only construct large mounds which cause loss of grass\nbut also clear areas of grass around the next and along the forage trails radiating from the central\nnest. Cleared areas around the nest may be 7 m or more in diameter. Generally, nests are\nconstructed in open areas and are a real problem on golf courses, recreational areas and\noccasionally in lawns. It is also thought that they may hinder reseeding of different grasses by\ncollecting seed. In addition, they can sting viciously. At least three small children have died from\ntheir stings in Oklahoma.\nLife History -- The harvester ants are social insects and live together in colonies. Winged\nmales and females swarm from the parent colony, pair off, and mate. The males die soon after\nmating. The female loses her wings, finds a suitable nesting site in the soil, and begins laying a\nfew eggs. After hatching, the queen feeds and cares for the young larvae. The larvae mature and\nchange to pupae, then to adult workers. The adult workers then begin taking care of the queen as\nwell as eggs and larvae of future generations.\n\nCONTROL\n\nIf only a few mounds occur, it is preferable to treat each mound individually.

Their principal source of food is seeds of various grasses and the flesh\nof arthropods.\nDamage -- The harvester ants not only construct large mounds which cause loss of grass\nbut also clear areas of grass around the next and along the forage trails radiating from the central\nnest. Cleared areas around the nest may be 7 m or more in diameter. Generally, nests are\nconstructed in open areas and are a real problem on golf courses, recreational areas and\noccasionally in lawns. It is also thought that they may hinder reseeding of different grasses by\ncollecting seed. In addition, they can sting viciously. At least three small children have died from\ntheir stings in Oklahoma.\nLife History -- The harvester ants are social insects and live together in colonies. Winged\nmales and females swarm from the parent colony, pair off, and mate. The males die soon after\nmating. The female loses her wings, finds a suitable nesting site in the soil, and begins laying a\nfew eggs. After hatching, the queen feeds and cares for the young larvae. The larvae mature and\nchange to pupae, then to adult workers. The adult workers then begin taking care of the queen as\nwell as eggs and larvae of future generations.\n\nCONTROL\n\nIf only a few mounds occur, it is preferable to treat each mound individually.

They can inflict a painful sting. The sting normally causes pain and swelling. If you are ever stung apply ice to the area until the pain subsides. If symptoms persist call your physician. Persons who are allergic to insect stings should be especially careful as they may require emergency medical attention in the event of an allergic reaction.\nWhat do I keep the ants in?\nWe use Rubbermaid plastic tubs that are about 2 feet by 3 feet by 6 inches deep. You will want a lid on top with about 10 small air holes in it. Harvester ants are not good climbers and should not be able to climb up smooth glass or plastic so aquariums or other similar habitats can be used as well. Cover the bottom of the habitat with about 1/4 inches of sand. Spray the sand with a little water to get the sand a little moist before placing your ants into the container.\nWhat do I feed the ants?\nHarvester ants will eat almost anything but their favorite foods are fresh vegetables and fruits. Feed them small pieces of celery, apple, lettuce, carrot, etc... Feed them small pieces about every other day. If some of the food is not eaten after 2 days remove it from the ant \"house\" as it can get moldy and be harmful to the ants.\nWhat about water for the ants?\nUsing a spray bottle, spray a mist of water onto the ants and sand once a day to keep the sand a little moist and give the ants some water. Don't spray too much or the ants may start to drown in the flood.\nHow do I feed the ants to my lizard?\nYou will only want to feed a few ants at a time to your lizard. We recommend about 5 ants at a time. Once those are eaten keep putting more ants in for the lizard until it is full (stops eating). A good tool to get is a large plastic funnel. A couple of plastic spoons or scoops are also useful. You can use the scoops or spoons and the funnel to transfer ants out of their \"house\" into a jar or other container at feeding time. Ants are cold blooded just like the lizards so try putting them in the refrigerator (not the freezer) for about 5 minutes to slow them down before feeding them to your pet(s).\nHow long will the ants live?\nThey will normally last 2 weeks to a month.\nOther tips for keeping ants\nYour ants will live longer if kept in a cool place. They are cold blooded just like reptiles. In fact, if you store them in a refrigerator or cooler they will go into hibernation and can be stored that way for months. Be sure to check the temperature of your cooler or refrigerator before doing this. If it is below 40 degrees they could freeze to death. 45 degrees is probably best. If you can't keep them in a cooler or refrigerator try to keep them in a cool room out of the sun.\nHow Many Ants Do I need?\nGenerally adult horned lizards will eat around 20 to 60 ants per day. You may be able to supplement your lizard's diet with crickets and if so you won't need as many ants. Juveniles will need less ants.\nNot all Horned Lizards Eat Harvester Ants\nTo the best of our knowledge there are 14 species of Horned Lizards in North America. Most of these depend on Harvester Ants as their staple diet. If your lizard comes from a cold, high altitude climate (for example Wyoming, Colorado, or Utah high country) or if your lizard is young, it may not eat Harvester Ants. If your Lizard comes from these areas or is young, you should try just a few Harvester Ants at first. If the Lizard does not eat them - you should remove the ants as quickly as possible so that they do not harm your Lizard. We have only had a very few cases where people caught lizards from these areas and they did not eat Harvester Ants. Lizards from these areas should not be kept because it is too difficult to obtain the right type of ants for them. Young lizards should be fed baby crickets or smaller ants if they are not able to eat harvester ants very well yet.\nAnts are shipped via US mail right to your door.  Ants are not guaranteed when your daytime high temperature is above 90 or below 35 degrees.\nSize: 1/4\"\nPrice Includes Shipping\nHow do I keep the Ants?\nThe easiest way is to just leave them in the shipping conatiner and store them in a Refrigerator.  The cold will slow the ants way down and they may even go into hibernation.  This makes it easy to keep them and easy to take ants out when it's time for feeding to your lizard.  As the ants warm up they will start to move around faster again.  It's a good idea to check the temperature of your fridge.  40 to 45 degrees is optimal.\nIf you are not able to keep them in a refrigerator, you can set up a different type of home for the ants.\nYou can use plastic tubs that are about 2 feet by 3 feet by 6 inches deep or something similar. You will want a lid on top with about 10 small air holes in it. Harvester ants are not good climbers and should not be able to climb up smooth glass or plastic so aquariums or other similar habitats can be used as well. Cover the bottom of the habitat with a few inches of sand. Play box sand, beach sand, or landscaping sand works fine. Spray the sand with a little water (a spray bottle works reall well for this) to get the sand a little moist before placing your ants into the container.\nWhat do I feed the ants?\nIf you are keeping the ants in the fridge they won't need much food or water.  We ship a little food in the container with the ants.\nIf you are not keeping the ants in the fridge you will need to feed and water them regularly.  Harvester ants will eat almost anything but their favorite foods are fresh vegetables and fruits. Feed them small pieces of celery, apple, lettuce, carrot, etc... Feed them small pieces about every other day. If some of the food is not eaten after 2 days remove it from the ant \"house\" as it can get moldy and be harmful to the ants.\nWhat about water for the ants?\nIf you are keeping the ants in the fridge you probably won't need to worry about giving them water.  If you aren't keeping the ants in the fridge they will need water every day.  Using a spray bottle, spray a mist of water onto the ants and sand once a day to keep the sand a little moist and give the ants some water.

Among the venomous insects, some possess only mildly toxic venom, while others pack a serious punch capable of taking down a threat as large as a person. Which insect has the most toxic venom of all?\n\nAnswer: \nThe insect with the most toxic venom is not necessarily the most painful or the most lethal. Pain is a fairly subjective measure. What I find excruciating, you might tolerate as merely uncomfortable. We can't compare venom on the basis of morbidity statistics, either, since people's immune systems respond differently to the same venom. For those with bee venom allergies, a bee sting can be deadly, though the venom itself is not that toxic.\nTo compare insect venoms and determine which is the most toxic, we need an objective way to measure them. A standard measure used in toxicology studies is the LD50, or median lethal dose. This measurement determines the amount of a toxin, relative to body weight, that is required to kill exactly half of a given population of organisms. In this case, researchers tested insect venom on mice to compare and rank their toxicity.\nSo which insect came out on top? The harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex maricopa. With an LD50 measurement of just 0.12 mg per kg of body weight, the harvester ant venom proved far more toxic than that of any bees, wasps, or other ants. By comparison, honey bee venom has an LD50 measure of 2.8, and a yellowjacket's venom has an LD50 of 3.5 per kg of body weight. Just 12 stings from the venomous harvester ant were enough to take out a 2 kg animal.\nFind out more: Is the red harvester ant's sting also the most painful?\nReference: W.L. Meyer. 1996.

I was surprised to learn Harvester Ants are common for ant farms as I was mostly familiar of them as having painful bites for their size (12 ants biting/stinging can kill a rat, and that they have a rating of 3 on the 0-4 Schmidt Pain Index which puts them above even fire ants, honey bee stings, yellow jackets, and other insects I thought were pretty painful)Because of the length of time there are bound to be errors with this kind of time lapse process inside a home.

The cats knocked the ant farm off the shelf as they were found sleeping right next to where it was the following morning.  Many ants have died as part of their natural 3 month life cycle, and with no queen to keep the hive coming it does come down to the end.

(Photo by Cathryn Hoyt)\nYou\u2019ve seen their sprawling, barren mounds, like little moonscapes in your field or lawn. You\u2019ve probably seen them lugging seeds back to their home. You may have even felt the burn of their sting. We know them as harvester ants\u2014so named because they harvest seeds. But what do they do with these seeds? And why do they build their conspicuous mounds?\n\nOf the 26 harvester ant species in the United States, at least 10 call Texas home. Their trademark is a three- to six-foot-wide clearing around the entrance to their underground nests.\nBefore they even begin building a nest, harvester ants clear plants away from the area. Why they do this isn\u2019t fully understood, but many reasons have been suggested. The bare area around the nest entrance ensures that the mound gets ample direct sunlight. This helps maintain relatively stable temperatures within the nest\u2019s tunnels and chambers, which in turn may help incubate eggs. By clearing such a large area, the ants may prevent plants from taking root that would shade their mound. The clearings may also help harvester ants spot predators more easily.\nCuriously, harvester ants don\u2019t leave these clearings totally clear. They cover them with pebbles, charcoal, and sometimes dead vegetation, among other things. Some researchers think this waterproofs their nest or acts as insulation.\nUnder a mound, nests can be more than 15-feet deep and house upwards of 12,000 ants. Inside these elaborate nests are numerous chambers\u2014called granaries\u2014where ants tend their nurseries, stash waste and store their harvest.\nEnergy-rich native grass seeds are a staple of harvester ant diets, though they also feed on arthropods and even animal feces. Female worker ants forage during the day, from spring until fall, after which the ants usually go dormant for the winter. As they search for food, worker ants create trails, which they follow as far as 40 feet from the mound, though some species have been reported to travel up to 160 feet. \nThe most familiar predators of harvester ants are Texas horned lizards, who specialize in eating them. Other predators include birds, toads, spiders, and insects, including other harvester ants.\nTo fend off predators, harvester ants have evolved incredibly painful stings. Their venom is among the world\u2019s most toxic insect venoms; a single sting contains enough toxin to kill several mice. Only female harvester ants sting though, and usually only when provoked.\nBecause of their powerful sting, some people regard harvester ants as a nuisance. But they\u2019re a natural ally in our fight against another insect nuisance\u2014red imported fire ants. The Comanche Harvester, for example, can be found hunting for fire ant queens. Once the fire ant queen mates and loses her wings, she drops to the ground, becoming prey for vigilant harvester ant workers.\nAt the same time, imported fire ants can decimate harvester ant populations. This has been linked to the decline of Texas horned lizards in some places. The fire ants both outcompete and prey on harvester ants, the lizards\u2019 primary food source. Young lizards are also sometimes killed by fire ants.\nDespite harvester ants\u2019 ecological importance, some landowners resort to poisoning their mounds, or inadvertently poison them when they\u2019re battling fire ants. If you use pesticides on fire ants, but want to protect harvester ants, spot treatment, rather than broadcast application, is recommended.\nAll in all, harvester ants are an object of curiosity for observant naturalists. Whether you love or hate them, do so with a healthy dose of respect.\nAnne Marie Hilscher is a lecturer and research technician at Sul Ross State University in Alpine, Texas.\nHave a question or comment about this episode?

The work by Stanford researchers revealed that the queen was still reproducing several decades after mating.\n\nBy Bjorn Carey\n\nHarvester ant foragers wait inside the nest. Biology Professor Deborah Gordon studies reproductive trends in wild ant colonies.\nAnts are just about everywhere you look, and yet it's largely unknown how they manage to be so ubiquitous. Scientists have understood the carnal mechanism of ant reproduction, but until now have known little of how successful the daughters of a colony are when they attempt to found new colonies.\nFor the first time, Stanford biologists have been able to identify specific parent ants and their own children in wild ant colonies, making it possible to study reproduction trends.\nAnd in a remarkable display of longevity, an original queen ant was found to be producing new ants several decades after mating, sending out daughter queens throughout her 20- to 30-year lifespan.\n\"Most animals produce offspring for a while, and then they enter a life stage where they don't,\" said Deborah Gordon, a biology professor at Stanford and a senior fellow at the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment. \"These queen ants are mating once, storing that sperm in a special sac, keeping it alive and using it to fertilize eggs for another 25 years.\"From an ecological viewpoint, an ant colony is much like a tree putting out seeds, with the potential to create new trees. An ant queen produces genetically identical worker ants that live in the same colony, and also produces sons, and daughter queens. The daughter queens, after mating, establish new colonies of their own.Gordon has been studying a particular population of harvester ant colonies in southeastern Arizona for 28 years, meticulously recording when a new colony rises or an older one falls.\nGordon's group took the DNA fingerprint of each colony by analyzing a section of microsatellite, or \"junk\", DNA to identify which colonies were related. By pairing the genetic analysis with the long-term observations, Gordon was able to determine the original queen and colony, and the order in which the daughter queens and subsequent generations established new colonies.\nThe researchers also found that only about 25 percent of the colonies reproduce at all, and many of the daughter queens are not successful. The entire population \u2013 the study group consisted of about 300 colonies \u2013 relies on just a few queens to make most of the offspring year after year.\n\"We don't know whether all harvester ant populations always behave this way, or whether these trends hold true for all 11,000 ant species, because nobody has identified colony offspring before,\" Gordon said. \"This gives us new insight on how ant populations change over time.\"\nIn general, ants play an important role in agriculture around the world, with some helping to disperse seeds while others eat herbivorous insects. Understanding how populations of ant colonies reproduce and expand, and the rate at which they do so, could be useful in managing invasive ant species, predicting crop yields and understanding the ecology of tropical forests.\n\"If you're trying to understand how a population grows \u2013 say, you are trying to keep a population of lions going \u2013 the first thing you need to know is how many lionesses you have, and how many cubs they have and can support per year,\" Gordon said. \"For ecological purposes, it's very useful to be able to say how ant populations will grow. This is the first step toward understanding how to predict numbers of ant colonies.\"\nThe study was published Jan. 31 in the online version of the Journal of Animal Ecology.\nDeborah Gordon, Biology: (650) 725-6364, dmgordon@stanford.edu\nBjorn Carey, Stanford News Service: (650) 725-1944, bccarey@stanford.edu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Stanford University.

Photo:  \u00a9 Chad TillbergGiant Tropical Ants (Dinoponera australis) live in South America and are\u2026.well, giant.\u00a0In addition to being one of the largest ants in the world (28 mm long or; about 1.1 inches), they are also incredibly abundant in tropical forest habitats.\u00a0How do these ants break the \u201cbig predators are rare\u201d rule?\u00a0Lead investigator Chad Tillberg explained the motivation for his research on this question:\nInvestigators Tillberg and Wittman take a break from ant catching. Photo:  \u00a9 Chad Tillberg\nWhen we started watching these enormous and abundant ants, it seemed really obvious to ask: What in the world are these ants eating?! \u00a0They had the reputation of being highly predacious, but could a top predator really be that abundant? \u00a0\nAnts have an amazingly broad history of dietary habits; they range from fungus growers and leaf cutters to ferocious, aggressive predators like army ants. Plant-eating ants dominate tropical ecosystems, and their carb-loading habits have been hypothesized as the reason why.\n\u201cMost of the time, animals that are really abundant (high biomass/area) are also low on the food chain (i.e. they\u2019re herbivorous). Here we seem to have a species that is both really abundant AND highly predacious. That\u2019s interesting and unusual. What is it that allows this predacious species to reach such high biomass?\u201d\nSo, how do you figure out what an ant species is eating, and how it finds its food? You locate some ant nests and dig them up, counting all the ants you find inside.\nChris Smith, hunting for ants. Photo:  \u00a9 Chad Tillberg\nThen you paint individual ants colors and spend 250 hours watching and tracking what they do. You also steal their prey and babies and take them back to the lab for isotope analysis. \u00a0Think your last trip was stressful? Try explaining to the TSA why you have giant, brightly painted predatory ants in your luggage.\nA marked colony of Dinoponera; the unique colors help identify individuals. Photo:  \u00a9 Chad Tillberg\nSitting outside staring intently at dirt also seems to be a good science outreach activity:\n\u201cWhen you see someone staring at something it\u2019s natural to wonder what they see. Some people thought we were crazy when they found it was ants were were watching so closely, but others got really enthused about it and had all sorts of questions.\u201d\nAll this hard work was somewhat mitigated by the amazing place it happened\u2014 Iguazu Falls, Argentina.\nIguazu Falls, Argentina. Photo by Charles Sharp\nWhat did the researchers conclude?\nThese ants really are quite abundant in their native habitat. They aren\u2019t just more noticeable because they are big.\u00a0This single ant species \u2014 and there are a LOT of ants in a rain forest, let me tell you \u2014 had a similar biomass as the rodents in the area, 2.5 kg/ha (over 5 lbs of ants).\u00a0Two lines of evidence (direct observation and stable isotopes) found these giant ants are predators of both herbivores and other predators.\u00a0 They don\u2019t seem to snack on plants, mostly eating caterpillars and grasshoppers.\nSo, this species of\u00a0 ants really does break the rule about big fierce animals being rare \u2014 but how do they do it?\nRuthlessly efficient foraging. \u00a0Most ants used the same route every time they left the nest. \u00a0By becoming familiar with a route, an individual ant could recognize landmarks and prey cues more quickly. \u00a0The distribution of different routes among nest-mates would create a sort of foraging grid, more effectively covering the area surrounding the nest. \u00a0Giant ants also\u00a0viciously defended their territory\u00a0from neighboring ant nests\u2014which produces a remarkably uniform nest spacing for the species.\nBecause this is observational field data, it\u2019s too soon to say if this is the complete explanation for the size and abundance of this ant, but Tillberg and his colleagues make a compelling case. And, provide a nice snapshot of what it takes to answer ecological questions in the tropics.\nChadwick V.

(Photo credit: Magdalena Sorger)\nA trap-jaw ant with its mouth-parts closed. (Photo credit: Magdalena Sorger)\nOther species within the Odontomachus genus expanded within the country as well while others have remained rather isolated, according to the paper published in the journal Zootaxa. These ants are native in areas of Central and South America, parts of\u00a0Asia, Australia and Africa.\nAccording to National Geographic, this type of ant does have venom, which it uses against its prey. Though not necessarily harmful to humans, ant specialist Andrew Suarez told National Geographic that the sting of the ant could be painful and could result in an allergic reaction.\nIn addition to using their trap-like jaws to wrestle prey, ants in the genus Odontomachus also use them to escape predators, flinging themselves from the mandibles upward. Watch how it\u2019s done in slow motion:\n\n\u201cThe next thing you know you have this ant flying through the air that you can\u2019t even see. It\u2019s moving so fast with a big stinger on the end of its abdomen,\u201d Sheila Patek with Duke University told National Geographic . \u201cIt is really nerve-racking working with them.\u201d\nSuarez\u00a0said trap-jaw ants might not be as much of a concern compared to other invasive ant species that have large colonies.\nBut, \u201cthat does not mean that they will have no impact,\u201d he told National Geographic.\n\u2014\nFront page image via\u00a0Luisa Mota/Flickr.\nBack to TheBlaze\u00a0\u00bb\n\u00ab\u00a0Back to TheBlaze\nIf you can't find TheBlaze, please call  to upgrade your package\nBut you can help!

Their exoskeleton isn't particularly thick, but it can turn aside weak punches and dull knives. Their mandibles can cut through most leather and plastic with ease, even snapping bones on a lucky hit. Giant ants become particularly aggressive when their queen is threatened.[3]\n\nThe mother of the ant brood, this variant is roughly four to five times larger than the average giant ant. When threatened, she buzz her wings and will hiss at the enemy. She will then proceed to spit an acidic saliva at the enemy in an attempt to ward them off. She cannot move much, so avoidance is easy, especially in smaller spaces.\n\nThese are the colony's main defense against intruders. They are plentiful and can often overwhelm an enemy by either running it off or killing it on the spot; usually the latter. This ant can often be found accompanying smaller ants as they forage.\n\nAs their name suggests, these ants do most of the work around the colony.\n\nTwo of them may be found attacking the Mutated forager ants in Shalebridge Tunnels.\n\nThey are friendly and won't attack, even if they are attacked.\n\nA rare variation, these are found in the Hoover Dam Scum Pits. Their exoskeleton is a very pale yellow that almost looks white. Their eyes glow red like the giant albino rat, and their mandibles glow green and drip an acidic green fluid. Small numbers of these ants live in a nest back in the office area. They are ravenous and will come out fairly often to catch and drag a rat or leech back into their dark lair.[4]\n\nThe giant albino ant queen is found in the ant hive located in the Scum Pits of Hoover Dam. Unlike the Giant albino ant, the queen's exoskeleton is only very pale on her abdomen.\n\nGiant ants appear in Fallout 2, Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas, J.E. Sawyer's Fallout Role-Playing Game and were due to appear in Van Buren, the canceled Fallout 3 by Black Isle Studios. A friendly giant ant called Mr. Pinch is used as a mount by the Puppet Man in the official One Man, and a Crate of Puppets comic by Penny Arcade.\n\nLike many other creatures in the Fallout series, the giant ant draws from old black and white cinema, particularly the movie \"Them!\".\n"], ["'Monstrously Big Ant' Fossil Found in Wyoming - LiveScience", "http://www.livescience.com/14008-giant-ant-fossil.html", "\r\n\tAlmost 50 million years ago, ants the size of hummingbirds roamed what is now Wyoming, a new fossil discovery reveals. These giant bugs may have crossed an Arctic land bridge between Europe and North America during a particularly warm period in Earth's history.\n\r\n\tAt about 2 inches (5 cm) long, the specimen is a \"monstrously big ant,\" said Bruce Archibald, a paleoentomologist at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia who reported the discovery today (May 3) in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Though fossils of loose giant ant wings have been found before in the United States, this is the first known full-body specimen.\n\r\n\tThe fossil ant is from a well-known fossil site in Wyoming called the Green River Formation, but it had been sitting in a drawer at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, Archibald said. When a curator showed him the fossil, Archibald said, he knew he was looking at something exciting. [Image of the giant ant fossil]\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\"I immediately recognized it and said, 'Oh my god, this is a giant ant and it looks like it's related to giant ants that are known from about this time in Germany.'\"\n\r\n\tOne living ant species, Dorylus wilverthi, has queens that reach the size of this ancient ant, though Titanomyrma was big all over while D. wilverthi gets its size from an abnormally swollen abdomen, Archibald said.\n\nArchibald dubbed the new ant Titanomyrma lubei -- \"titan\" for its size, \"myrma\" for the Greek, \"myrmex,\" or ant, and \"lubei\" for the fossil collector who discovered the specimen, Louis Lube. The burning question, however, was how giant ants ended up on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nMonster ant\n\r\n\tAnts are tough bugs -- some can even create rafts out of their own bodies to survive floods. But a look at modern large ants showed Archibald and his colleagues that T. lubei very likely needed a warm climate to live, similar to modern-day giant ants. For instance, D. wilverthi lives in equatorial Africa. Other ants bigger than about an inch (3 cm) long are spread across tropical areas of South America, Southeast Asia and Australia. [Infographic: The Life of an Ant]\n\r\n\tLikewise, ancient giant ant fossils have been found in Europe in areas that were tropical during the early part of the Eocene, an epoch that lasted from 56 million to 34 million years ago, a time when the continents were closer together and the sea level was low: \"You could have walked from Vancouver to London across dry land,\" Archibald said.\n\r\n\tBut to cross the continents, you still had to traverse the Arctic. Back then, the Arctic was much warmer than it is today, a temperate zone rather than a winter wonderland.\n\nAn open Arctic for ants\n\r\n\t\"Temperate\" would have been too chilly for the giant ants, however. The key to the ants' march, Archibald and his colleagues found, were relatively brief periods in which temperature shot up enough to make the Arctic passable. These periods, which lasted a few hundred thousand years each, may have been driven by the release of carbon dioxide from sediment.\n\r\n\tThe warm periods would have brought the average temperature in the coldest Arctic months up to 46 degrees Fahrenheit (8 degrees Celsius), a survivable temperature for the tropical ants.\n\r\n\tThe researchers aren't sure whether the ants started in Europe and spread to North America or the other way around. University of Bonn paleoentomologist Torsten Wappler, who was not involved in the study, is working to classify the various species of ancient giant ants and describe how they lived. Some fossils preserve bits of organs, including stingers, genitalia and stomachs, Wappler told LiveScience.\n\r\n\t\"Now we can compare this North American species with the European ones,\" Wappler said. \"That was not possible before.\" The comparison may shed light on the bugs' origin.\n\nYou can follow LiveScience\u00a0senior writer Stephanie Pappas on Twitter @sipappas.

Ants evolved from wasp-like ancestors in the mid-Cretaceous period between 110 and 130\u00a0million years ago and diversified after the rise of flowering plants. More than 12,500 of an estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified.[3][4] They are easily identified by their elbowed antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists.\nAnts form colonies that range in size from a few dozen predatory individuals living in small natural cavities to highly organised colonies that may occupy large territories and consist of millions of individuals. Larger colonies consist mostly of sterile, wingless females forming castes of \"workers\", \"soldiers\", or other specialised groups. Nearly all ant colonies also have some fertile males called \"drones\" and one or more fertile females called \"queens\". The colonies sometimes are described as superorganisms because the ants appear to operate as a unified entity, collectively working together to support the colony.[5]\nAnts have colonised almost every landmass on Earth. The only places lacking indigenous ants are Antarctica and a few remote or inhospitable islands. Ants thrive in most ecosystems and may form 15\u201325% of the terrestrial animal biomass.[6] Their success in so many environments has been attributed to their social organisation and their ability to modify habitats, tap resources, and defend themselves. Their long co-evolution with other species has led to mimetic, commensal, parasitic, and mutualistic relationships.[7]\nAnt societies have division of labour, communication between individuals, and an ability to solve complex problems.[8] These parallels with human societies have long been an inspiration and subject of study. Many human cultures make use of ants in cuisine, medication, and rituals. Some species are valued in their role as biological pest control agents.[9] Their ability to exploit resources may bring ants into conflict with humans, however, as they can damage crops and invade buildings. Some species, such as the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta), are regarded as invasive species, establishing themselves in areas where they have been introduced accidentally.[10]\n\n\nThe word \"ant\" is derived from ante, emete of Middle English which are derived from \u01e3mette of Old English, and is related to the dialectal Dutch emt and the Old High German \u0101meiza, hence the modern German Ameise. All of these words come from West Germanic *\u0113maitij\u01ed, and the original meaning of the word was \"the biter\" (from Proto-Germanic *ai-, \"off, away\" + *mait- \"cut\").[11][12] The family name Formicidae is derived from the Latin form\u012bca (\"ant\")[13] from which the words in other Romance languages, such as the Portuguese formiga, Italian formica, Spanish hormiga, Romanian furnic\u0103, and French fourmi are derived. It has been hypothesised that a Proto-Indo-European word *morwi- was used, cf. Sanskrit vamrah, Latin form\u012bca, Greek \u03bc\u03cd\u03c1\u03bc\u03b7\u03be m\u00fdrm\u0113x, Old Church Slavonic mraviji, Old Irish moirb, Old Norse maurr, Dutch mier.[14]\nChrysidoidea\nVespidae\nRhopalosomatidae\nPompilidae\nTiphiidae\nScolioidea\nApoidea\nFormicidae\nThe family Formicidae belongs to the order Hymenoptera, which also includes sawflies, bees, and wasps. Ants evolved from a lineage within the aculeate wasps, and a 2013 study suggests they are a sister group of the Apoidea.[15] In 1966, E. O. Wilson and his colleagues identified the fossil remains of an ant (Sphecomyrma) that lived in the Cretaceous period. The specimen, trapped in amber dating back to around 92\u00a0million years ago, has features found in some wasps, but not found in modern ants.[16] Sphecomyrma possibly was a ground forager, while Haidomyrmex and Haidomyrmodes, related genera in subfamily Sphecomyrminae, are reconstructed as active arboreal predators.[17] After the rise of flowering plants about 100\u00a0million years ago they diversified and assumed ecological dominance around 60\u00a0million years ago.[18][19][20][21] Some groups such as the Leptanillinae and Martialinae are suggested to have diversified from early primitive ants which were likely to have been predators underneath the surface of the soil.[2][22]\nDuring the Cretaceous period, a few species of primitive ants ranged widely on the Laurasian supercontinent (the Northern Hemisphere). They were scarce in comparison to the populations of other insects, representing only about 1% of the entire insect population. Ants became dominant after adaptive radiation at the beginning of the Paleogene period. By the Oligocene and Miocene, ants had come to represent 20\u201340% of all insects found in major fossil deposits. Of the species that lived in the Eocene epoch, around one in 10 genera survive to the present. Genera surviving today comprise 56% of the genera in Baltic amber fossils (early Oligocene), and 92% of the genera in Dominican amber fossils (apparently early Miocene).[18][23]\nTermites, although sometimes called 'white ants', are not ants. They belong to the order Isoptera. Termites are more closely related to cockroaches and mantids. Termites are eusocial, but differ greatly in the genetics of reproduction. The similarity of their social structure to that of ants is attributed to convergent evolution.[24] Velvet ants look like large ants, but are wingless female wasps.[25][26]\nAnts are found on all continents except Antarctica, and only a few large islands such as Greenland, Iceland, parts of Polynesia and the Hawaiian Islands lack native ant species.[28][29] Ants occupy a wide range of ecological niches, and are able to exploit a wide range of food resources either as direct or indirect herbivores, predators, and scavengers. Most species are omnivorous generalists, but a few are specialist feeders. Their ecological dominance may be measured by their biomass and estimates in different environments suggest that they contribute 15\u201320% (on average and nearly 25% in the tropics) of the total terrestrial animal biomass, which exceeds that of the vertebrates.[6]\nAnts range in size from 0.75\u00a0to 52 millimetres (0.030\u20132.0\u00a0in),[30][31] the largest species being the fossil Titanomyrma giganteum, the queen of which was 6 centimetres (2.4\u00a0in) long with a wingspan of 15 centimetres (5.9\u00a0in).[32] Ants vary in colour; most ants are red or black, but a few species are green and some tropical species have a metallic lustre. More than 12,000 species are currently known (with upper estimates of the potential existence of about 22,000) (see the article List of ant genera), with the greatest diversity in the tropics. Taxonomic studies continue to resolve the classification and systematics of ants. Online databases of ant species, including AntBase and the Hymenoptera Name Server, help to keep track of the known and newly described species.[33] The relative ease with which ants may be sampled and studied in ecosystems has made them useful as indicator species in biodiversity studies.[34][35]\nAnts are distinct in their morphology from other insects in having elbowed antennae, metapleural glands, and a strong constriction of their second abdominal segment into a node-like petiole. The head, mesosoma, and metasoma are the three distinct body segments. The petiole forms a narrow waist between their mesosoma (thorax plus the first abdominal segment, which is fused to it) and gaster (abdomen less the abdominal segments in the petiole). The petiole may be formed by one or two nodes (the second alone, or the second and third abdominal segments).[36]\nLike other insects, ants have an exoskeleton, an external covering that provides a protective casing around the body and a point of attachment for muscles, in contrast to the internal skeletons of humans and other vertebrates. Insects do not have lungs; oxygen and other gases such as carbon dioxide pass through their exoskeleton via tiny valves called spiracles. Insects also lack closed blood vessels; instead, they have a long, thin, perforated tube along the top of the body (called the \"dorsal aorta\") that functions like a heart, and pumps haemolymph toward the head, thus driving the circulation of the internal fluids. The nervous system consists of a ventral nerve cord that runs the length of the body, with several ganglia and branches along the way reaching into the extremities of the appendages.[37]\nAn ant's head contains many sensory organs. Like most insects, ants have compound eyes made from numerous tiny lenses attached together. Ant eyes are good for acute movement detection, but do not offer a high resolution image. They also have three small ocelli (simple eyes) on the top of the head that detect light levels and polarization.[38] Compared to vertebrates, most ants have poor-to-mediocre eyesight and a few subterranean species are completely blind. Some ants such as Australia's bulldog ant, however, have excellent vision and are capable of discriminating the distance and size of objects moving nearly a metre away.[39]\nTwo antennae (\"feelers\") are attached to the head; these organs detect chemicals, air currents, and vibrations; they also are used to transmit and receive signals through touch. The head has two strong jaws, the mandibles, used to carry food, manipulate objects, construct nests, and for defence.[37] In some species a small pocket (infrabuccal chamber) inside the mouth stores food, so it may be passed to other ants or their larvae.[40]\nAll six legs are attached to the mesosoma (\"thorax\"). A hooked claw at the end of each leg helps ants to climb and to hang onto surfaces.[citation needed]\nOnly reproductive ants, queens and males, have wings. Queens shed the wings after the nuptial flight, leaving visible stubs, a distinguishing feature of queens. Wingless queens (ergatoids) and males occur in a few species, however.[37]\nThe metasoma (the \"abdomen\") of the ant houses important internal organs, including those of the reproductive, respiratory (tracheae), and excretory systems. Workers of many species have their egg-laying structures modified into stings that are used for subduing prey and defending their nests.[37]\nIn the colonies of a few ant species, there are physical castes\u2014workers in distinct size-classes, called minor, median, and major workers. Often the larger ants have disproportionately larger heads, and correspondingly stronger mandibles. Such individuals sometimes are called \"soldier\" ants because their stronger mandibles make them more effective in fighting, although they still are workers and their \"duties\" typically do not vary greatly from the minor or median workers. In a few species the median workers are absent, creating a sharp divide between the minors and majors.[41] Weaver ants, for example, have a distinct bimodal size distribution.[42][43] Some other species show continuous variation in the size of workers. The smallest and largest workers in Pheidologeton diversus show nearly a 500-fold difference in their dry-weights.[44] Workers cannot mate; however, because of the haplodiploid sex-determination system in ants, workers of a number of species can lay unfertilised eggs that become fully fertile, haploid males. The role of workers may change with their age and in some species, such as honeypot ants, young workers are fed until their gasters are distended, and act as living food storage vessels. These food storage workers are called repletes.[45] For instance, these replete workers develop in the North American honeypot ant Myrmecocystus mexicanus. Rissing found that usually the largest workers in the colony develop into repletes, and if repletes are removed from the colony other workers become repletes, demonstrating the flexibility of this particular polymorphism.[46] This polymorphism in morphology and behaviour of workers initially was thought to be determined by environmental factors such as nutrition and hormones that led to different developmental paths; however, genetic differences between worker castes have been noted in Acromyrmex sp.[47] These polymorphisms are caused by relatively small genetic changes; differences in a single gene of Solenopsis invicta can decide whether the colony will have single or multiple queens.[48] The Australian jack jumper ant (Myrmecia pilosula) has only a single pair of chromosomes (with the males having just one chromosome as they are haploid), the lowest number known for any animal, making it an interesting subject for studies in the genetics and developmental biology of social insects.[49][50]\nThe life of an ant starts from an egg. If the egg is fertilised, the progeny will be female (diploid); if not, it will be male (haploid). Ants develop by complete metamorphosis with the larva stages passing through a pupal stage before emerging as an adult. The larva is largely immobile and is fed and cared for by workers. Food is given to the larvae by trophallaxis, a process in which an ant regurgitates liquid food held in its crop. This is also how adults share food, stored in the \"social stomach\". Larvae, especially in the later stages, may also be provided solid food such as trophic eggs, pieces of prey, and seeds brought by workers.\nThe larvae grow through a series of four or five moults and enter the pupal stage. The pupa has the appendages free and not fused to the body as in a butterfly pupa.[51] The differentiation into queens and workers (which are both female), and different castes of workers (when they exist), is influenced in some species by the nutrition the larvae obtain. Genetic influences and the control of gene expression by the developmental environment are complex and the determination of caste continues to be a subject of research.[52] Larvae and pupae need to be kept at fairly constant temperatures to ensure proper development, and so often, are moved around among the various brood chambers within the colony.[53]\nA new worker spends the first few days of its adult life caring for the queen and young. She then graduates to digging and other nest work, and later to defending the nest and foraging. These changes are sometimes fairly sudden, and define what are called temporal castes. An explanation for the sequence is suggested by the high casualties involved in foraging, making it an acceptable risk only for ants who are older and are likely to die soon of natural causes.[54][55]\nMost ant species have a system in which only the queen and breeding females have the ability to mate. Contrary to popular belief, some ant nests have multiple queens while others may exist without queens. Workers with the ability to reproduce are called \"gamergates\" and colonies that lack queens are then called gamergate colonies; colonies with queens are said to be queen-right.[56] The winged male ants, called drones, emerge from pupae along with the breeding females (although some species, such as army ants, have wingless queens), and do nothing in life except eat and mate.\nMost ants are univoltine, producing a new generation each year.[57] During the species-specific breeding period, new reproductives, females and winged males leave the colony in what is called a nuptial flight. Typically, the males take flight before the females. Males then use visual cues to find a common mating ground, for example, a landmark such as a pine tree to which other males in the area converge. Males secrete a mating pheromone that females follow. Females of some species mate with just one male, but in some others they may mate with as many as ten or more different males.[7]\nMated females then seek a suitable place to begin a colony. There, they break off their wings and begin to lay and care for eggs. The females store the sperm they obtain during their nuptial flight to selectively fertilise future eggs. The first workers to hatch are weak and smaller than later workers, but they begin to serve the colony immediately. They enlarge the nest, forage for food, and care for the other eggs. This is how new colonies start in most ant species. Species that have multiple queens may have a queen leaving the nest along with some workers to found a colony at a new site,[58] a process akin to swarming in honeybees.\nA wide range of reproductive strategies have been noted in ant species. Females of many species are known to be capable of reproducing asexually through thelytokous parthenogenesis [59] and one species, Mycocepurus smithii, is known to be all-female.[60]\nAnt colonies can be long-lived. The queens can live for up to 30\u00a0years, and workers live from 1 to 3\u00a0years. Males, however, are more transitory, being quite short-lived and surviving for only a few weeks.[61] Ant queens are estimated to live 100 times longer than solitary insects of a similar size.[62]\nAnts are active all year long in the tropics, but, in cooler regions, they survive the winter in a state of dormancy or inactivity. The forms of inactivity are varied and some temperate species have larvae going into the inactive state, (diapause), while in others, the adults alone pass the winter in a state of reduced activity.[63]\nAnts communicate with each other using pheromones, sounds, and touch.[64] The use of pheromones as chemical signals is more developed in ants, such as the red harvester ant, than in other hymenopteran groups. Like other insects, ants perceive smells with their long, thin, and mobile antennae. The paired antennae provide information about the direction and intensity of scents. Since most ants live on the ground, they use the soil surface to leave pheromone trails that may be followed by other ants. In species that forage in groups, a forager that finds food marks a trail on the way back to the colony; this trail is followed by other ants, these ants then reinforce the trail when they head back with food to the colony. When the food source is exhausted, no new trails are marked by returning ants and the scent slowly dissipates. This behaviour helps ants deal with changes in their environment. For instance, when an established path to a food source is blocked by an obstacle, the foragers leave the path to explore new routes. If an ant is successful, it leaves a new trail marking the shortest route on its return. Successful trails are followed by more ants, reinforcing better routes and gradually identifying the best path.[65]\nAnts use pheromones for more than just making trails. A crushed ant emits an alarm pheromone that sends nearby ants into an attack frenzy and attracts more ants from farther away. Several ant species even use \"propaganda pheromones\" to confuse enemy ants and make them fight among themselves.[66] Pheromones are produced by a wide range of structures including Dufour's glands, poison glands and glands on the hindgut, pygidium, rectum, sternum, and hind tibia.[62] Pheromones also are exchanged, mixed with food, and passed by trophallaxis, transferring information within the colony.[67] This allows other ants to detect what task group (e.g., foraging or nest maintenance) other colony members belong to.[68] In ant species with queen castes, when the dominant queen stops producing a specific pheromone, workers begin to raise new queens in the colony.[69]\nSome ants produce sounds by stridulation, using the gaster segments and their mandibles. Sounds may be used to communicate with colony members or with other species.[70][71]\nAnts attack and defend themselves by biting and, in many species, by stinging, often injecting or spraying chemicals such as formic acid in the case of formicine ants, alkaloids and piperidines in fire ants, and a variety of protein components in other ants. Bullet ants (Paraponera), located in Central and South America, are considered to have the most painful sting of any insect, although it is usually not fatal to humans. This sting is given the highest rating on the Schmidt Sting Pain Index.\nThe sting of jack jumper ants can be fatal,[72] and an antivenom has been developed for it.[73]\nFire ants, Solenopsis spp., are unique in having a poison sac containing piperidine alkaloids.[74] Their stings are painful and can be dangerous to hypersensitive people.[75]\nTrap-jaw ants of the genus Odontomachus are equipped with mandibles called trap-jaws, which snap shut faster than any other predatory appendages within the animal kingdom.[76] One study of Odontomachus bauri recorded peak speeds of between 126 and 230\u00a0km/h (78\u00a0\u2013 143\u00a0mph), with the jaws closing within 130 microseconds on average. The ants were also observed to use their jaws as a catapult to eject intruders or fling themselves backward to escape a threat.[76] Before striking, the ant opens its mandibles extremely widely and locks them in this position by an internal mechanism. Energy is stored in a thick band of muscle and explosively released when triggered by the stimulation of sensory organs resembling hairs on the inside of the mandibles. The mandibles also permit slow and fine movements for other tasks. Trap-jaws also are seen in the following genera: Anochetus, Orectognathus, and Strumigenys,[76] plus some members of the Dacetini tribe,[77] which are viewed as examples of convergent evolution.\nA Malaysian species of ant in the Camponotus cylindricus group has enlarged mandibular glands that extend into their gaster. When disturbed, workers rupture the membrane of the gaster, causing a burst of secretions containing acetophenones and other chemicals that immobilise small insect attackers. The worker subsequently dies.[78]\nSuicidal defences by workers are also noted in a Brazilian ant, Forelius pusillus, where a small group of ants leaves the security of the nest after sealing the entrance from the outside each evening.[79]\nIn addition to defence against predators, ants need to protect their colonies from pathogens. Some worker ants maintain the hygiene of the colony and their activities include undertaking or necrophory, the disposal of dead nest-mates.[80] Oleic acid has been identified as the compound released from dead ants that triggers necrophoric behaviour in Atta mexicana[81] while workers of Linepithema humile react to the absence of characteristic chemicals (dolichodial and iridomyrmecin) present on the cuticle of their living nestmates to trigger similar behaviour.[82]\nNests may be protected from physical threats such as flooding and overheating by elaborate nest architecture.[83][84] Workers of Cataulacus muticus, an arboreal species that lives in plant hollows, respond to flooding by drinking water inside the nest, and excreting it outside.[85] Camponotus anderseni, which nests in the cavities of wood in mangrove habitats, deals with submergence under water by switching to anaerobic respiration.[86]\nMany animals can learn behaviours by imitation, but ants may be the only group apart from mammals where interactive teaching has been observed. A knowledgeable forager of Temnothorax albipennis will lead a naive nest-mate to newly discovered food by the process of tandem running. The follower obtains knowledge through its leading tutor. The leader is acutely sensitive to the progress of the follower and slows down when the follower lags and speeds up when the follower gets too close.[87]\nControlled experiments with colonies of Cerapachys biroi suggest that an individual may choose nest roles based on her previous experience. An entire generation of identical workers was divided into two groups whose outcome in food foraging was controlled. One group was continually rewarded with prey, while it was made certain that the other failed. As a result, members of the successful group intensified their foraging attempts while the unsuccessful group ventured out fewer and fewer times. A month later, the successful foragers continued in their role while the others had moved to specialise in brood care.[88]\nComplex nests are built by many ant species, but other species are nomadic and do not build permanent structures. Ants may form subterranean nests or build them on trees. These nests may be found in the ground, under stones or logs, inside logs, hollow stems, or even acorns. The materials used for construction include soil and plant matter,[58] and ants carefully select their nest sites; Temnothorax albipennis will avoid sites with dead ants, as these may indicate the presence of pests or disease. They are quick to abandon established nests at the first sign of threats.[89]\nThe army ants of South America, such as the Eciton burchellii species, and the driver ants of Africa do not build permanent nests, but instead, alternate between nomadism and stages where the workers form a temporary nest (bivouac) from their own bodies, by holding each other together.[90]\nWeaver ant (Oecophylla spp.) workers build nests in trees by attaching leaves together, first pulling them together with bridges of workers and then inducing their larvae to produce silk as they are moved along the leaf edges. Similar forms of nest construction are seen in some species of Polyrhachis.[91]\nFormica polyctena, among other ant species, constructs nests that maintain a relatively constant interior temperature that aids in the development of larvae. The ants maintain the nest temperature by choosing the location, nest materials, controlling ventilation and maintaining the heat from solar radiation, worker activity and metabolism, and in some moist nests, microbial activity in the nest materials.[92]\nSome ant species such as those that use natural cavities can be opportunistic and make use of the controlled micro-climate provided inside human dwellings and other artificial structures to house their colonies and nest structures.[93][94]\nMost ants are generalist predators, scavengers, and indirect herbivores,[20] but a few have evolved specialised ways of obtaining nutrition. Leafcutter ants (Atta and Acromyrmex) feed exclusively on a fungus that grows only within their colonies. They continually collect leaves which are taken to the colony, cut into tiny pieces and placed in fungal gardens. Workers specialise in related tasks according to their sizes. The largest ants cut stalks, smaller workers chew the leaves and the smallest tend the fungus. Leafcutter ants are sensitive enough to recognise the reaction of the fungus to different plant material, apparently detecting chemical signals from the fungus. If a particular type of leaf is found to be toxic to the fungus, the colony will no longer collect it. The ants feed on structures produced by the fungi called gongylidia. Symbiotic bacteria on the exterior surface of the ants produce antibiotics that kill bacteria introduced into the nest that may harm the fungi.[95]\nForaging ants travel distances of up to 200 metres (700\u00a0ft) from their nest [96] and scent trails allow them to find their way back even in the dark. In hot and arid regions, day-foraging ants face death by desiccation, so the ability to find the shortest route back to the nest reduces that risk. Diurnal desert ants of the genus Cataglyphis such as the Sahara desert ant navigate by keeping track of direction as well as distance travelled. Distances travelled are measured using an internal pedometer that keeps count of the steps taken [97] and also by evaluating the movement of objects in their visual field (optical flow).[98] Directions are measured using the position of the sun.[99] They integrate this information to find the shortest route back to their nest.[100] Like all ants, they can also make use of visual landmarks when available [101] as well as olfactory and tactile cues to navigate.[102][103] Some species of ant are able to use the Earth's magnetic field for navigation.[104] The compound eyes of ants have specialised cells that detect polarised light from the Sun, which is used to determine direction.[105][106] These polarization detectors are sensitive in the ultraviolet region of the light spectrum.[107] In some army ant species, a group of foragers who become separated from the main column sometimes may turn back on themselves and form a circular ant mill. The workers may then run around continuously until they die of exhaustion.[108]\nThe female worker ants do not have wings and reproductive females lose their wings after their mating flights in order to begin their colonies. Therefore, unlike their wasp ancestors, most ants travel by walking. Some species are capable of leaping. For example, Jerdon's jumping ant (Harpegnathos saltator) is able to jump by synchronising the action of its mid and hind pairs of legs.[109] There are several species of gliding ant including Cephalotes atratus; this may be a common trait among most arboreal ants. Ants with this ability are able to control the direction of their descent while falling.[110]\nOther species of ants can form chains to bridge gaps over water, underground, or through spaces in vegetation. Some species also form floating rafts that help them survive floods. These rafts may also have a role in allowing ants to colonise islands.[111] Polyrhachis sokolova, a species of ant found in Australian mangrove swamps, can swim and live in underwater nests. Since they lack gills, they go to trapped pockets of air in the submerged nests to breathe.[112]\nNot all ants have the same kind of societies. The Australian bulldog ants are among the biggest and most basal of ants. Like virtually all ants, they are eusocial, but their social behaviour is poorly developed compared to other species. Each individual hunts alone, using her large eyes instead of chemical senses to find prey.[113]\nSome species (such as Tetramorium caespitum) attack and take over neighbouring ant colonies. Others are less expansionist, but just as aggressive; they invade colonies to steal eggs or larvae, which they either eat or raise as workers or slaves. Extreme specialists among these slave-raiding ants, such as the Amazon ants, are incapable of feeding themselves and need captured workers to survive.[114] Captured workers of the enslaved species Temnothorax have evolved a counter strategy, destroying just the female pupae of the slave-making Protomognathus americanus, but sparing the males (who don't take part in slave-raiding as adults).[115]\nAnts identify kin and nestmates through their scent, which comes from hydrocarbon-laced secretions that coat their exoskeletons. If an ant is separated from its original colony, it will eventually lose the colony scent. Any ant that enters a colony without a matching scent will be attacked.[116] Also, the reason why two separate colonies of ants will attack each other even if they are of the same species is because the genes responsible for pheromone production are different between them. The Argentine ant, however, does not have this characteristic, due to lack of genetic diversity, and has become a global pest because of it.\nParasitic ant species enter the colonies of host ants and establish themselves as social parasites; species such as Strumigenys xenos are entirely parasitic and do not have workers, but instead, rely on the food gathered by their Strumigenys perplexa hosts.[117][118] This form of parasitism is seen across many ant genera, but the parasitic ant is usually a species that is closely related to its host. A variety of methods are employed to enter the nest of the host ant. A parasitic queen may enter the host nest before the first brood has hatched, establishing herself prior to development of a colony scent. Other species use pheromones to confuse the host ants or to trick them into carrying the parasitic queen into the nest. Some simply fight their way into the nest.[119]\nA conflict between the sexes of a species is seen in some species of ants with these reproducers apparently competing to produce offspring that are as closely related to them as possible. The most extreme form involves the production of clonal offspring. An extreme of sexual conflict is seen in Wasmannia auropunctata, where the queens produce diploid daughters by thelytokous parthenogenesis and males produce clones by a process whereby a diploid egg loses its maternal contribution to produce haploid males who are clones of the father.[120]\nAnts form symbiotic associations with a range of species, including other ant species, other insects, plants, and fungi. They also are preyed on by many animals and even certain fungi. Some arthropod species spend part of their lives within ant nests, either preying on ants, their larvae, and eggs, consuming the food stores of the ants, or avoiding predators. These inquilines may bear a close resemblance to ants. The nature of this ant mimicry (myrmecomorphy) varies, with some cases involving Batesian mimicry, where the mimic reduces the risk of predation. Others show Wasmannian mimicry, a form of mimicry seen only in inquilines.[121][122]\nAphids and other hemipteran insects secrete a sweet liquid called honeydew, when they feed on plant sap. The sugars in honeydew are a high-energy food source, which many ant species collect.[123] In some cases, the aphids secrete the honeydew in response to ants tapping them with their antennae. The ants in turn keep predators away from the aphids and will move them from one feeding location to another. When migrating to a new area, many colonies will take the aphids with them, to ensure a continued supply of honeydew. Ants also tend mealybugs to harvest their honeydew. Mealybugs may become a serious pest of pineapples if ants are present to protect mealybugs from their natural enemies.[124]\nMyrmecophilous (ant-loving) caterpillars of the butterfly family Lycaenidae (e.g., blues, coppers, or hairstreaks) are herded by the ants, led to feeding areas in the daytime, and brought inside the ants' nest at night. The caterpillars have a gland which secretes honeydew when the ants massage them. Some caterpillars produce vibrations and sounds that are perceived by the ants.[125] Other caterpillars have evolved from ant-loving to ant-eating: these myrmecophagous caterpillars secrete a pheromone that makes the ants act as if the caterpillar is one of their own larvae. The caterpillar is then taken into the ant nest where it feeds on the ant larvae.[126] Fungus-growing ants that make up the tribe Attini, including leafcutter ants, cultivate certain species of fungus in the Leucoagaricus or Leucocoprinus genera of the Agaricaceae family. In this ant-fungus mutualism, both species depend on each other for survival. The ant Allomerus decemarticulatus has evolved a three-way association with the host plant, Hirtella physophora (Chrysobalanaceae), and a sticky fungus which is used to trap their insect prey.[127]\nLemon ants make devil's gardens by killing surrounding plants with their stings and leaving a pure patch of lemon ant trees, (Duroia hirsuta). This modification of the forest provides the ants with more nesting sites inside the stems of the Duroia trees.[128] Although some ants obtain nectar from flowers, pollination by ants is somewhat rare.[129] Some plants have special nectar exuding structures, extrafloral nectaries that provide food for ants, which in turn protect the plant from more damaging herbivorous insects.[130] Species such as the bullhorn acacia (Acacia cornigera) in Central America have hollow thorns that house colonies of stinging ants (Pseudomyrmex ferruginea) who defend the tree against insects, browsing mammals, and epiphytic vines. Isotopic labelling studies suggest that plants also obtain nitrogen from the ants.[131] In return, the ants obtain food from protein- and lipid-rich Beltian bodies. Another example of this type of ectosymbiosis comes from the Macaranga tree, which has stems adapted to house colonies of Crematogaster ants.\nMany tropical tree species have seeds that are dispersed by ants.[132] Seed dispersal by ants or myrmecochory is widespread and new estimates suggest that nearly 9% of all plant species may have such ant associations.[133][134] Some plants in fire-prone grassland systems are particularly dependent on ants for their survival and dispersal as the seeds are transported to safety below the ground. Many ant-dispersed seeds have special external structures, elaiosomes, that are sought after by ants as food.[135]\nA convergence, possibly a form of mimicry, is seen in the eggs of stick insects. They have an edible elaiosome-like structure and are taken into the ant nest where the young hatch.[136]\nMost ants are predatory and some prey on and obtain food from other social insects including other ants. Some species specialise in preying on termites (Megaponera and Termitopone) while a few Cerapachyinae prey on other ants.[96] Some termites, including Nasutitermes corniger, form associations with certain ant species to keep away predatory ant species.[137] The tropical wasp Mischocyttarus drewseni coats the pedicel of its nest with an ant-repellent chemical.[138] It is suggested that many tropical wasps may build their nests in trees and cover them to protect themselves from ants. Stingless bees (Trigona and Melipona) use chemical defences against ants.[96]\nFlies in the Old World genus Bengalia (Calliphoridae) prey on ants and are kleptoparasites, snatching prey or brood from the mandibles of adult ants.[139] Wingless and legless females of the Malaysian phorid fly (Vestigipoda myrmolarvoidea) live in the nests of ants of the genus Aenictus and are cared for by the ants.[139]\nFungi in the genera Cordyceps and Ophiocordyceps infect ants. Ants react to their infection by climbing up plants and sinking their mandibles into plant tissue. The fungus kills the ants, grows on their remains, and produces a fruiting body. It appears that the fungus alters the behaviour of the ant to help disperse its spores [140] in a microhabitat that best suits the fungus.[141] Strepsipteran parasites also manipulate their ant host to climb grass stems, to help the parasite find mates.[142]\nA nematode (Myrmeconema neotropicum) that infects canopy ants (Cephalotes atratus) causes the black-coloured gasters of workers to turn red. The parasite also alters the behaviour of the ant, causing them to carry their gasters high. The conspicuous red gasters are mistaken by birds for ripe fruits such as Hyeronima alchorneoides and eaten. The droppings of the bird are collected by other ants and fed to their young, leading to further spread of the nematode.[143]\nSouth American poison dart frogs in the genus Dendrobates feed mainly on ants, and the toxins in their skin may come from the ants.[144]\nArmy ants forage in a wide roving column, attacking any animals in that path that are unable to escape. In Central and South America, Eciton burchellii is the swarming ant most commonly attended by \"ant-following\" birds such as antbirds and woodcreepers.[145][146] This behaviour was once considered mutualistic, but later studies found the birds to be parasitic. Although direct kleptoparasitism (birds stealing food from the ants' grasp) is rare, the birds eat many prey insects that the ants would otherwise eat and thus decrease their foraging success.[147] Birds indulge in a peculiar behaviour called anting that, as yet, is not fully understood. Here birds rest on ant nests, or pick and drop ants onto their wings and feathers; this may be a means to remove ectoparasites from the birds.\nAnteaters, aardvarks, pangolins, echidnas and numbats have special adaptations for living on a diet of ants. These adaptations include long, sticky tongues to capture ants and strong claws to break into ant nests. Brown bears (Ursus arctos) have been found to feed on ants. About 12%, 16%, and 4% of their faecal volume in spring, summer, and autumn, respectively, is composed of ants.[148]\nAnts perform many ecological roles that are beneficial to humans, including the suppression of pest populations and aeration of the soil. The use of weaver ants in citrus cultivation in southern China is considered one of the oldest known applications of biological control.[9] On the other hand, ants may become nuisances when they invade buildings, or cause economic losses.\nIn some parts of the world (mainly Africa and South America), large ants, especially army ants, are used as surgical sutures. The wound is pressed together and ants are applied along it. The ant seizes the edges of the wound in its mandibles and locks in place. The body is then cut off and the head and mandibles remain in place to close the wound.[149][150][151]\nSome ants have toxic venom and are of medical importance. The species include Paraponera clavata (tocandira) and Dinoponera spp. (false tocandiras) of South America [152] and the Myrmecia ants of Australia.[153]\nIn South Africa, ants are used to help harvest rooibos (Aspalathus linearis), which are small seeds used to make a herbal tea. The plant disperses its seeds widely, making manual collection difficult. Black ants collect and store these and other seeds in their nest, where humans can gather them en masse. Up to half a pound (200\u00a0g) of seeds may be collected from one ant-heap.[154][155]\nAlthough most ants survive attempts by humans to eradicate them, a few are highly endangered. These tend to be island species that have evolved specialized traits and risk being displaced by introduced ant species. Examples include the critically endangered Sri Lankan relict ant (Aneuretus simoni) and Adetomyrma venatrix of Madagascar.[156]\nIt has been estimated by E.O. Wilson that the total number of individual ants alive in the world at any one time is between one and ten quadrillion (short scale) (i.e. between 1015 and 1016). According to this estimate, the total biomass of all the ants in the world is approximately equal to the total biomass of the entire human race.[157] Also, according to this estimate, there are approximately 1 million ants for every human on Earth.[158]\nAnts and their larvae are eaten in different parts of the world. The eggs of two species of ants are used in Mexican escamoles. They are considered a form of insect caviar and can sell for as much as USD\u00a040 per pound (USD\u00a090/kg) because they are seasonal and hard to find. In the Colombian department of Santander, hormigas culonas (roughly interpreted as \"large-bottomed ants\") Atta laevigata are toasted alive and eaten.[159]\nIn areas of India, and throughout Burma and Thailand, a paste of the green weaver ant (Oecophylla smaragdina) is served as a condiment with curry.[160] Weaver ant eggs and larvae, as well as the ants, may be used in a Thai salad, yam (Thai: \u0e22\u0e33), in a dish called yam khai mot daeng (Thai: \u0e22\u0e33\u0e44\u0e02\u0e48\u0e21\u0e14\u0e41\u0e14\u0e07) or red ant egg salad, a dish that comes from the Issan or north-eastern region of Thailand. Saville-Kent, in the Naturalist in Australia wrote \"Beauty, in the case of the green ant, is more than skin-deep. Their attractive, almost sweetmeat-like translucency possibly invited the first essays at their consumption by the human species\". Mashed up in water, after the manner of lemon squash, \"these ants form a pleasant acid drink which is held in high favor by the natives of North Queensland, and is even appreciated by many European palates\".[161]\nIn his First Summer in the Sierra, John Muir notes that the Digger Indians of California ate the tickling, acid gasters of the large jet-black carpenter ants. The Mexican Indians eat the replete workers, or living honey-pots, of the honey ant (Myrmecocystus).[161]\nSome ant species are considered as pests. The presence of ants can be undesirable in places meant to be sterile. They can also come in the way of humans by their habit of raiding stored food, damaging indoor structures, causing damage to agricultural crops either directly or by aiding sucking pests or because of their stings and bites.[10] The adaptive nature of ant colonies make it nearly impossible to eliminate entire colonies and most pest management practices aim to control local populations and tend to be temporary solutions.\nSome of the ants classified as pests include the pavement ant, yellow crazy ant, sugar ants, the Pharaoh ant, carpenter ants, Argentine ant, odorous house ants, red imported fire ant, and European fire ant. Ant populations are managed by a combination of approaches that make use of chemical, biological and physical methods. Chemical methods include the use of insecticidal bait which is gathered by ants as food and brought back to the nest where the poison is inadvertently spread to other colony members through trophallaxis. Management is based on the species and techniques can vary according to the location and circumstance.[10]\nObserved by humans since the dawn of history, the behaviour of ants has been documented and the subject of early writings and fables passed from one century to another. Those using scientific methods, myrmecologists, study ants in the laboratory and in their natural conditions. Their complex and variable social structures have made ants ideal model organisms. Ultraviolet vision was first discovered in ants by Sir John Lubbock in 1881.[162] Studies on ants have tested hypotheses in ecology and sociobiology, and have been particularly important in examining the predictions of theories of kin selection and evolutionarily stable strategies.[163] Ant colonies may be studied by rearing or temporarily maintaining them in formicaria, specially constructed glass framed enclosures.[164] Individuals may be tracked for study by marking them with dots of colours.[165]\nThe successful techniques used by ant colonies have been studied in computer science and robotics to produce distributed and fault-tolerant systems for solving problems, for example Ant colony optimization and Ant robotics. This area of biomimetics has led to studies of ant locomotion, search engines that make use of \"foraging trails\", fault-tolerant storage, and networking algorithms.[8]\nAnthropomorphised ants have often been used in fables and children's stories to represent industriousness and cooperative effort. They also are mentioned in religious texts.[166][167] In the Book of Proverbs in the Bible, ants are held up as a good example for humans for their hard work and cooperation. Aesop did the same in his fable The Ant and the Grasshopper. In the Quran, Sulayman is said to have heard and understood an ant warning other ants to return home to avoid being accidentally crushed by Sulayman and his marching army.[Quran\u00a027:18][168] In parts of Africa, ants are considered to be the messengers of the deities. Some Native American mythology, such as the Hopi mythology, considers ants as the very first animals. Ant bites are often said to have curative properties. The sting of some species of Pseudomyrmex is claimed to give fever relief.[169] Ant bites are used in the initiation ceremonies of some Amazon Indian cultures as a test of endurance.[170][171]\nAnt society has always fascinated humans and has been written about both humorously and seriously. Mark Twain wrote about ants in his 1880 book A Tramp Abroad.[172] Some modern authors have used the example of the ants to comment on the relationship between society and the individual. Examples are Robert Frost in his poem \"Departmental\" and T. H. White in his fantasy novel The Once and Future King. The plot in French entomologist and writer Bernard Werber's Les Fourmis science-fiction trilogy is divided between the worlds of ants and humans; ants and their behaviour is described using contemporary scientific knowledge. H.G. Wells wrote about intelligent ants destroying human settlements in Brazil and threatening human civilization in his 1905 science-fiction short story, The Empire of the Ants. In more recent times, animated cartoons and 3-D animated films featuring ants have been produced including Antz, A Bug's Life, The Ant Bully, The Ant and the Aardvark, and Atom Ant. Renowned myrmecologist E. O. Wilson wrote a short story, \"Trailhead\" in 2010 for The New Yorker magazine, which describes the life and death of an ant-queen and the rise and fall of her colony, from an ants' point of view.[173]\nFrom the late 1950s through the late 1970s, ant farms were popular educational children's toys in the United States. Later versions use transparent gel instead of soil, allowing greater visibility.[174] In the early 1990s, the video game SimAnt, which simulated an ant colony, won the 1992 Codie award for \"Best Simulation Program\".[175]\nAnts also are quite popular inspiration for many science-fiction insectoids, such as the Formics of Ender's Game, the Bugs of Starship Troopers, the giant ants in the films Them! and Empire of the Ants, Marvel Comics' super hero Ant-Man, and ants mutated into super-intelligence in Phase IV. In computer strategy games, ant-based species often benefit from increased production rates due to their single-minded focus, such as the Klackons in the Master of Orion series of games or the ChCht in Deadlock II. These characters are often credited with a hive mind, a common misconception about ant colonies.[176]"], ["Ant, Giant - Paizo", "http://paizo.com/prd/monsters/ant.html", "Check out the full line of Pathfinder Roleplaying Game products, or discussthe game with the Paizo community onour messageboards!\nNeed to report a PRD problem?Let us know by posting here.\nA writhing carpet of ants seethes over the ground, consuming everything in its path.\nArmy Ant Swarm CR 5\nXP 1,600\nN Fine vermin (swarm)\nInit +2; Senses darkvision 60 ft., scent; Perception +4\nDefense\nAC 20, touch 20, flat-footed 18; (+8 size, +2 Dex)\nhp 49 (11d8)\nFort +7, Ref +5, Will +3\nDefensive Abilities swarm traits; Immune weapon damage\nOffense\nSpeed 30 ft., climb 30 ft.\nMelee swarm (3d6)\nSpace 10 ft.; Reach 0 ft.\nSpecial Attacks cling, consume, distraction (DC 15)\nStatistics\nStr 1, Dex 15, Con 10, Int \u2014, Wis 10, Cha 2\nBase Atk +8; CMB \u2014; CMD \u2014\nSkills Climb +10, Perception +4; Racial Modifiers +4 Perception\nEcology\nEnvironment any tropical\nOrganization solitary, pair, patrol (3\u20136 swarms), or legion (7\u201316 swarms)\nTreasure none\nSpecial Abilities\nCling (Ex) If a creature leaves an army ant swarm's square, the swarm suffers 1d6 points of damage to reflect the loss of its numbers as several of the crawling pests continue to cling tenaciously to the victim.

(Credit: Bruce Archibald)\nSome 50 million years ago, giant ants the size of hummingbirds marched across what is now Wyoming, according to a study published May 4 in the scientific journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B. The four paleontologists who wrote the paper reached these conclusions after discovering the fossil of a new ant species, which they dubbed Titanomyrma lubei, in a drawer at the Denver Museum of Nature & Science in Colorado.\nTaken from a rich fossil quarry in Wyoming known as the Green River Formation, the 2-inch-long ant fossil immediately reminded researchers of similar insects that thrived in Germany at about the same time in history, known as the Eocene Epoch. The only modern ants whose queens are capable of attaining the (relatively) massive size of these ancient bugs belong to the species Dorylus wilverthi and exclusively live in tropical regions of Africa. Like their present-day counterparts, the giant ants of the Eocene apparently flourished in the heat: The areas of Wyoming and Germany in which their fossils were found are known to have had tropic climates at that time.\nA modern giant ant of the Dorylus genus, found in tropical regions of Africa, with a captured termite.\n\u201cWhat is surprising is that this ant scurried about an ancient forest in what is now Wyoming when the climate there was hot like the modern tropics,\u201d said Bruce Archibald, a paleoentomologist at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia who is one of the study\u2019s authors. \u201cIn fact, all of the closely related fossil giant ants have been found in Europe and North America at sites that had hot climates.\u201d\nThe similarities between Wyoming\u2019s Titanomyrma lubei and the oversize ants of prehistoric Germany are consistent with the prevailing theory that many plant and animal species migrated between North America and Europe during the Eocene, a time when a land bridge across the Arctic connected the two continents. For the researchers, however, this posed a dilemma: Though far more temperate than it is today, the Eocene Arctic would likely have been too cold for the ants to survive the trek\u2014whether it was from North America to Europe or the other way around.\nThe study\u2019s authors suspect that the ants made the journey during one or more of the multiple global warming episodes that heated the planet during the Eocene, raising temperatures enough to make the Arctic passable even for tropical species. It is believed that these \u201chyperthermals,\u201d which lasted several hundred thousand years each, may have been caused by the release of carbon dioxide from the oceans into the atmosphere.\nTitanomyrma lubei represents the first example of a known species that could only have weathered the voyage with the help of a hyperthermal, according to the team. They also believe that further research on these early migrations may shed light on how today\u2019s climate changes may affect living things and their distribution. \u201cAs the Earth\u2019s climate changes, we are seeing tropical pest species extend their ranges into mid-latitudes and dragonflies appear in the Arctic,\u201d Archibald explained. \u201cUnderstanding the details of how life forms adapted to global warming in the past will be of increasing importance in the future.\u201d\nFollow Eustace, Tom and Marty as they devote their lives to surviving off the grid, on their own terms.\n\nGet the real story behind this famous World War II icon.\nExplore 7 ways the battle changed the course of the Civil War.\n\nWatch the exclusive web series.\n\nSep4\nOn this day in 1886, Apache chief Geronimo surrenders to U.S. government troops.

Its well-known features include its hanging paper nests and the females' habit of defending them with repeated stings.[1]\n\n\nThe bald-faced hornet actualy belongs to a genus of yellowjackets in North America, but unlike many congeners it lacks yellow coloring.[2] Instead, it is called a hornet in the American sense of a wasp that builds paper nests.[3] It is large compared to other yellowjackets, with adults averaging 2\u20133\u00a0cm long. It is sometimes confused with the similar-sized European hornet, the only true hornet in America, but is distinguished by its mostly white \"baldfaced\" head and three white stripes on the end of its abdomen.[2]\nIt is best known for its large, football-shaped paper nest, which it builds in the spring to rear young. The nest, one of the largest of wasp nests, can be up to 14 inches (35\u00a0cm) in diameter and 23 inches (60\u00a0cm) in length.[2] The population of a nest varies from 100 to 700 individuals, averaging around 400.[2] The bald-faced hornet is protective of the nest and will sting repeatedly if it is disturbed.[2] This wasp is more aggressive than most yellowjackets of Dolichovespula and the genus Vespula, and the nest should be observed only from a distance.\nThe bald-faced hornet lives in North America, including southern Canada, the Rocky Mountains, the western coast of the United States, and most of the eastern US. It is most common in the southeastern United States.\nEach spring, queens that were born and fertilized at the end of the previous season begin new colonies. A queen selects a location for its nest, begins building it, lays a first batch of eggs and feeds this first group of larvae. These become workers and assume the chore of expanding the nest. They chew up wood, which mixes with a starch in their saliva. They then spread it around with their mandibles and legs, and it dries into a papery structure. The workers guard the nest and feed on nectar, tree sap and fruit pulp (particularly that of apples). They also prey on insects and other arthropods, chewing them up and feeding them to the larvae. They have been known to scavenge raw meat. In late summer and early fall, the queen begins to lay eggs which will become drones and new queens. After pupation, these fertile males and females fly off to mate and start new colonies.\nAs winter approaches, the wasps die, except the freshly fertilized queens. These hibernate underground, under logs or in hollow trees until spring. The nest is generally abandoned by winter, and will not be reused. When spring arrives, the young queens emerge and the cycle begins again.\nThe bald-faced hornet is considered useful by some people in that it preys on pest species of flies, caterpillars, and spiders. It is considered a pest itself, building hives of stinging insects near human habitation. It is a minor pollinator of some flowers.\nLike other social wasps, bald-faced hornets have a caste system made up, in one nest, of the following:\nNest\nInside the paper covering of a bald-faced hornet nest are several suspended combs containing chambers for larvae\nPaper covering of a bald-faced hornet nest conceals several suspended combs containing chambers for larvae.

Payne, USDA\n         ARS\n\nCopyright, Whitney Cranshaw\nCopyright, Whitney Cranshaw\nA nest is started by one female, which will become its queen. In the spring, she begins the nest by making a few cells (little round rooms) out of paper in a tree or shrub, anywhere from 2 to 40 feet from the ground. She then lays an egg in each cell. When young wasp larvae hatch, the queen feeds them. Larva are fed chewed up insects.\nWhen larvae are big enough, they pupate (resting stage). They soon emerge as adult female workers.\nWorkers take over all nest duties, and the queen's only job now is to lay more eggs. Workers build new layers of cells onto the nest, collect food, feed larvae, and protect the nest.\nThroughout the summer, the nest gets bigger, until it's about the size of a basketball. All of the new hornets are female workers.\n\nAt the end of summer, or in early Fall, the queen lays eggs which will become females and males. These insects mate, and then all of the nest's hornets die (including the old queen), except the females who have mated.\nMated females overwinter and start their own nests next Spring.  They often burrow into an old tree stump to survive the cold.\nOld nests are abandoned. You can see old nests in Winter, hanging in trees when leaves have fallen.\nCopyright, Tom Murray\n\nEdward L. Manigault, Clemson\nUniversity Donated Collection\nNests are interwoven with branches and twigs. This makes sure they are strong and don't get destroyed by weather. The entrance hole is near the bottom of the nest.\nAdult Bald-faced Hornets eat flower nectar, fruit juice, sap, and insects. Workers kill many insects and chew them up to feed larvae.\nPredators of adult hornets include birds, spiders, frogs, mantids, and other insect predators.\nNests are preyed upon by Raccoons. Fox and Striped Skunk will also raid them if they're close to the ground. These mammals usually rip them open in the fall, when nests aren't as active. They eat adults, pupae, and larvae.\n\n\nCopyright, Chris Wirth\n\nCopyright, Steve Scott\nAt left, a Bald-faced Hornet worker eats sap from an oak tree.

They have air vents located on the top of the nest, which allows warm air to escape but greatly reduces the amount of rain that might enter.Early in the spring and summer, protein in the form of live prey is the usual diet consisting of flies, other yellowjackets and many other types of insects.\u00a0 Some nests are so full of yellowjacket remains that the inside has a yellowish cast to it.\u00a0 As the season progresses and there are fewer larvae to feed, the workers will take nectar and other forms of carbohydrates.\u00a0 Most of the colony, other than newly fertilized potential queens that will overwinter, will die before or shortly after the first hard frost.\nBaldfaced hornets can be considered a beneficial insect in that they reduce populations of unwanted insects (including other yellowjackets) and will help pollinate flowers when they are searching for nectar.\u00a0 Therefore, unless the nests are located close (within 10 feet) of an entrance to a building, under an eave that is close to the ground or in shrubbery next to a lawn that is mowed, the nests can be ignored.\u00a0 However, individuals with known sensitivities to wasp and bee stings should have any nests close to their homes removed by professional pest management personnel (pest control companies).Those individuals without medical concerns and with a degree of daring can kill the colony by spraying a \u2018wasp and hornet\u2019 spray into the nest opening during the nighttime.\u00a0 The nest should be scouted during daylight to determine the best approach that will not disturb the wasps prior to introduction of the insecticide.\u00a0 DO NOT stand away from the nest and spray only the exterior as this will anger the colony and increase the risk of stings during the next several days.\u00a0\u00a0 Effective control can only be achieved by stealthy approach and then spraying the pressurized material directly into the nest opening \u2013 holding the nozzle against the hole.\u00a0 The pressure of the spray in addition to the nozzle will retard any attempts by the wasps to exit.\u00a0 It is advisable to wear long sleeved clothing, long rubber gloves and goggles to protect yourself from any insecticide that falls out of the nest or splashes off the surface.\u00a0\u00a0 Launder clothes and take a shower immediately after application if any insecticide falls on you.Always read the insecticide label and follow those recommendations.\nPesticides are poisonous. Read and follow directions and safety precautions on labels. Handle carefully and store in original labeled containers out of the reach of children, pets, and livestock.

Contrary to the name, the baldfaced hornet is not a hornet. It is actually one of the many types of yellowjackets found in the United States. The baldfaced hornet is often confused with a similar sized wasp, the European hornet, which is the only true hornet in North America. In nature, baldfaced hornets are extremely valuable because they kill many pests including flies, caterpillars, and spiders. It is only when their nests are located near areas of human activity that they pose a threat to people.\nBaldfaced hornets are different from other yellowjackets because of their white and black color as opposed to the more typical yellow and black pattern. The most notable feature of this wasp is the white or \u201cbaldface\u201d head. They also have three white stripes on the end of their body. Compared to other yellowjackets, baldfaced hornets are extremely large. Adult workers vary in size, but average about 3/4 inch long. Queens look similar to the workers and are only a little larger.\nBaldfaced hornet nests are made up of one queen and many female workers. During early spring (April June) mated queens emerge from protected sites, such as stumps, logs, and under loose bark. \nOnce she finds a suitable location, a queen begins construction of a paper nest, lays eggs, and collects\u00a0 prey to feed her growing young. After the first generation of wasps complete development and emerge as winged adults, they assume the duties of building and maintaining the nest, and foraging forfood, water, and care for the colony. Colonies often average about 400 workers, but can vary in size\u00a0 from 100 700. In early July to September, new queens and\u00a0 males are produced. The males and queens will leave the nest, mate and the new queens will find a suitable protected site to overwinter. The original queen and workers die after the males and future queens leave the nest. In most cases, abandoned nests are not reused and often decompose during the winter. Nests that have been reused have only been seen in more tropical areas of North America. \nBaldfaced hornet nests often hang in trees and shrubs where they go unnoticed until the leaves have dropped in the fall. Nests can also be built on eves ofbuildings, on windows, in attics or on other artificial structures. They are often pear or egg shaped and can be as large as 14 inches in diameter and over 23 inches in length. Nests are constructed of multiple layers of hexagonal combs, similar in shape to those of honeybee nests and covered in a mottled gray paper envelope. The raw materials for the \u201cpaper\u201d are from vegetable fibers, such as rotten or weathered wood, dead plants, or even man made materials such as cardboard and newspaper. The fibers are chewed and mixed with saliva to make a pulp which is then formed into place.\nThe sting of a baldfaced hornet is similar to most other social bees and wasps. A typical reaction includes immediate pain and/or swelling at the sting site. Other sensations may include burning and itching. For some individuals the initial swelling may be painful and increase to affect a larger area. One unique behavior of baldfaced hornets is the ability to\u00a0 squirt venom from the stinger into the eyes of nest intruders. The venom\u00a0 causes immediate watering of the eyes and temporary blindness.\nMost social wasps vigorously defend their nests from perceived threats. Baldfaced hornets are known for their defensive behavior. People are often stung when they accidentally stumble upon a hidden nest or when the nest is located in areas adjacent to homes or places where there is human activity. It is when nests are located close to areas with human activity or there is a medical threat to persons who may be allergic to venom that control is warranted.\nEffective control involves treating the nest.\u00a0 The nest should be located during daylight hours, but treatment should occur at night when wasp activity is less and\u00a0 most of the baldfaced hornets have returned to the nest. Lights used to illuminate the nest should not be directly held by a person. The light source should point toward the nest, but away from the person treating. Thick protective clothing, including boots, gloves, hat and eyeware should be worn to guard against stings. There are many types of insecticides that will kill baldfaced hornets. Generally, aerosol sprays labeled for wasps and hornets, that shoot a long stream of insecticide, are a good choice. Many aerosol products contain materials useful in getting a quick \u201cknockdown\u201d, while others containing foaming agents that expand within the nest to spread the insecticide, minimizing the number of wasps escaping the nest. Insecticidal dusts also can be applied into the nest, however they may take several hours to achieve the desired result and require the applicator to get close to the nest. When treating any material, a sufficient amount of insecticide should then be applied directly into the nest entrance to ensure thorough coverage. Once the insecticide has been applied, it is helpful to leave the nest intact for a few days to allow time to\u00a0 kill all the workers and newly emerging wasps. When control has been achieved, the nest should be removed, and placed in a sealed plastic garbage bag and properly disposed. Nests treated with insecticides should not be kept for display purposes.\nTreating baldfaced hornet nests can be tricky and dangerous. If a nest of baldfaced hornets is not threatening people, it should be left alone, to be killed naturally during the winter. If a nest must be controlled, homeowners should seriously consider hiring a pest control professional with expertise in killing and removing baldfaced hornets and their nests.

They construct a football or upside down teardrop-shaped nest from gray paper. Hornets, as do wasps and yellow jackets, actually make this paper themselves by chewing on tiny slivers of wood.

Bald-faced hornets are more closely related to yellow jackets than they are to hornets.\u00a0The body of the bald-faced hornet is black in color, and its face is marked with white. Bald-faced hornets are larger than most yellow jackets, with workers ranging from 15 to 20 mm or more.\nBald-faced hornets are most active during the day. They usually build aerial nests made of paper in trees or under overhangs.\u00a0Adults consume liquids, usually sugars like juices or nectar, but will bring back solids such as insects or carrion for the larvae to consume.\nThe nest of the bald-faced hornet can be found hanging from trees, bushes and buildings. A colony begins in spring, when a queen lays a single egg inside each cell as she begins to build her nest. She puts insects and nectar into the cell with the egg. These eggs hatch into larvae, eventually becoming workers that help to further expand the nest.\nA bald-faced hornet nest can grow to be as large as a basketball within a number of months. As many as 700 workers may live in the nest.\u00a0Males appear late in the summer. The males fertilize some of the newly developed females. These fertilized females look for places to hibernate as cold weather approaches. They will be the next season\u2019s queens. The remaining members of the nest perish in winter.\nThe large paper nest and the workers are the signs of bald-faced hornet activity.\nWhile bald-faced hornets do prey upon other pests and can prove beneficial, their nests should not be permitted to develop near a home. Workers are protective and aggressive when disturbed. Nests should not be handled without the assistance of a pest control professional.\n\n\n\n\nBald Faced Hornets Video\n\nHornet Nests\nGiant Hornets\nWhat Do Hornets Eat?\nBees and Hornets\nGetting Rid of Hornets\n\n\t\tGive us a call:\n        \n844-514-3980\n\n\nOr schedule a call with an Orkin Specialist today and get a FREE estimate for:\n\n\t\tThis branch appears close by:\n\t\t\n\n,  \n\n\nNot in ?\n\t\tEnter a zip code below to view local branches.\n\u00a0"], ["Bald-faced Hornet Facts - NatureMapping", "http://naturemappingfoundation.org/natmap/facts/bald-faced_hornet_712.html", "\nNatureMapping Animal Facts\nBald-faced Hornet\n\n\nBald-faced Hornet (Dolichovespula maculata)\n\n\n\n\nDescription: \r\n\r\nThe Bald-faced Hornet is a North American insect that builds a large paper nest to house the social colony. \r\n\r\nCommonly called the bald-faced hornet (or white-faced hornet), it is not a true hornet.

(Wikipedia)\n\nWhy wasp sting: \n\r\nAll social wasps are capable of producing a painful sting, but none leave the stinger embedded in the skin, as do honey bee workers. \r\nMost stings occur when the colony is disturbed. The objective is for the wasps to protect the nest site. In the photo, \r\nyou can see hornets guarding the entrance. \r\nHornets are very protective of their colony and will attack if someone approaches within a few feet of the nest. \r\n\n\r\nWhen a bee or wasp stings, it injects a venomous fluid under the skin of the victim. Bald-faced Hornets have a smooth stinger, \r\nso they can sting more than once.\r\n\r\n\nNest Building:\n\r\nIn the spring, the Bald-faced Hornet queen collects wood fiber to make her nest. Some of the fiber can come from a house or fence. \r\nThe gray paper nest can be found suspended from a tree branch, eaves or other structures.  \r\nWhen the nest is finished, it will be the size of a football or basketball.   \nThe nest is constructed of paper-like material made from chewed wood fibers mixed with saliva. \r\n\r\nThe bald-faced hornet builds her inner nest with layers of paper cells that look \r\nlike the honeybee's comb. \r\nThe nest is composed of 3 or 4 tiers of combs within a thick, layered paper-like outer shell. An opening at the \r\nbottom of the nest allows the hornets to fly in and out (see photo).\n\nNests are built every year. The abandoned nest is often destroyed by birds searching for food.\nReproduction:\nQueens are the only members of the colony able to survive the winter. In April or May, each queen selects a suitable location, constructs a small nest and \r\nbegins raising sterile daughter offspring. These workers take over the duties of enlarging and maintaining the nest, foraging for food and caring for the offspring while the queen functions only to produce more eggs.\r\n\nThe queen bee lays all of the eggs in a colony. \r\nThe queen fertilizes each egg as it is being laid using stored sperm from the spermatheca. The queen occasionally will not fertilize an egg. \r\nThese non-fertilized eggs, having only half as many genes as the queen or the workers, develop into male drones.\r\n\n\r\nThe mature colony consists of a queen, 200 to 400 winged infertile female workers, brood (eggs, larvae and pupae) and, in late summer, males and reproductive females.\r\n \n\n\nDid you know?\n\n Bald-face hornets live in large groups called colonies.\r\n Bald-face hornets build aerial nests as big as a basketball.\r\n Drones come from non-fertilized eggs. Since drones are males, they have no sting.\r\n Female hornets will sting repeatedly to protect the colony.\r\n Most wasps feed on insects, while bees rely on a diet of nectar or pollen.\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\nBald-face hornet nest suspended in a magnolia tree above a sidewalk in Seattle.

This species features a rather stout body and their markings are more white than yellow.  They are mainly black from head, thorax and abdomen and the pattern of white bands and markings is the same for all individuals.  Males differ from females somewhat in having an additional white band on the first abdominal segment as well as at the tip. Workers measure between 12 and 15mm while the queen is substantially larger at 18 to 20mm.\n\nBald-faced Hornets are considered a beneficial species as they prey on flies and other yellowjackets. Adults will chew flies into a pulp and feed them to their larvae. Adults are also known to feed on nectar and tree sap for themselves. Their habitat ranges from parks and gardens, to forests and meadows. \n\nBald-Faced Hornets are extremely aggressive if they, or their nest, is disturbed and they WILL STING REPEATEDLY. Hives are a gray shapely paper-like mass with an opening at the bottom. These football-shaped nests are above ground, usually attached to lower branches of a tree or shrub.  Active nests can contain anywhere from 100-400 individuals.\r\n\nCategory: Bee, Ant, Wasp and Similar\nCommon name: Bald-Faced Hornet\nScientific Name: Dolichovespula\u00a0maculata\n\nTaxonomy:\r\n\u00a0 Kingdom: Animalia\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Phylum: Arthropoda\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Class: Insecta\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Order: Hymenoptera\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Family: Vespidae\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Genus: Dolichovespula\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Species: maculata\n\nAdult Size (Length): \r\n12mm to 20mm\r\n(0.47in to 0.79in) COMPARE\nIdentifying Colors: black, white, yellow\nGeneral Description: bee, white, triangle, harmful, stinging, flying, fat\nNorth American Reach (Though Not Limited To*): Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming\n* Keep in mind that insect reach is not governed by lines on a map and therefore may appear in areas/regions/states beyond those listed above.\n\u2022 Spiders\r\n\u2022 Beetles\r\n\u2022 Bees, Ants, Wasps and Similar\r\n\u2022 Butterflies and Moths\r\n\u2022 Dragonflies and Damselflies\r\n\u2022 Centipedes\r\n\u2022  Earwigs\r\n\u2022 Alderflies, Fishflies and Dobsonflies\r\n\u2022 Grasshoppers and Crickets\r\n\u2022 True Bugs\r\n\u2022 Walkingsticks and Timemas\r\n\u2022 Cicada and Similar\r\n\u2022 Flies and Mosquitoes\r\n\u2022 Mantises\r\n\u2022 Mites and Ticks\r\n\u2022 Scorpions or Scorpionlike\r\n\u2022 Cockroaches\r\n\u2022 Bristletails\r\n\u2022 Mayflies\r\n\u2022 Snakeflies\r\n\u2022 Antlions and Lacewings\r\n\u2022 Crustaceans\r\n\u2022 VIEW ALL\n\u2022 Indentifying Insects\r\n\u2022 Insect Anatomy\r\n\u2022 Insect Mouth Parts Guide\n\u2022 Anatomy of the Honey Bee\r\n\u2022 Insect Dichotomous Key \r\n\u2022 Arachnid Dichotomous Key \r\n\u2022 Taxonomic Orders\r\n\u2022 Insect Orders\r\n\u2022 Scientific Names\r\n\u2022 Metamorphosis\r\n\u2022 Molting Process Pictures\r\n\u2022 Winged Insect Key\n\u2022 Biting Insects\r\n\u2022 Flying Insects\r\n\u2022 Helpful Insects\r\n\u2022 Nursery Web Spider\r\n\u2022 Spiders.us\n\u2022 Alabama\r\n\u2022 Alaska\r\n\u2022 Arizona\r\n\u2022 Arkansas\r\n\u2022 California\r\n\u2022 Colorado\r\n\u2022 Connecticut\r\n\u2022 Delaware\r\n\u2022 Florida\r\n\u2022 Georgia\r\n\u2022 Hawaii\r\n\u2022 Idaho\r\n\u2022 Illinois\r\n\u2022 Indiana\r\n\u2022 Iowa\r\n\u2022 Kansas\r\n\u2022 Kentucky\r\n\u2022 Louisiana\r\n\u2022 Maine\r\n\u2022 Maryland\r\n\u2022 Massachusetts\r\n\u2022 Michigan\r\n\u2022 Minnesota\r\n\u2022 Mississippi\r\n\u2022 Missouri\r\n\u2022 Montana\r\n\u2022 Nebraska\r\n\u2022 Nevada\r\n\u2022 New Hampshire\r\n\u2022 New Jersey\r\n\u2022 New Mexico\r\n\u2022 New York\r\n\u2022 North Carolina\r\n\u2022 North Dakota\r\n\u2022 Ohio\r\n\u2022 Oklahoma\r\n\u2022 Oregon\r\n\u2022 Pennsylvania\r\n\u2022 Rhode Island\r\n\u2022 South Carolina\r\n\u2022 South Dakota\r\n\u2022 Tennessee\r\n\u2022 Texas\r\n\u2022 Utah\r\n\u2022 Vermont\r\n\u2022 Virginia\r\n\u2022 Washington\r\n\u2022 West Virginia\r\n\u2022 Wisconsin\r\n\u2022 Wyoming\nSite Disclaimer \u00a0|\u00a0 Privacy Policy \u00a0|\u00a0 Site Map\n\u00a92014 www.InsectIdentification.org.

The wings are translucent dark brown.\nIn winter after leaf-fall, look up into trees for old nests, which are large, rounded, papery, and gray. The nests of this social insect are frequently seen in natural history displays. Unlike the wasps we usually call yellowjackets, this species is not yellow. Its larger size and black and ivory coloration make it easy to distinguish as a distinct type of social wasp.\nPaper wasps are the most familiar of Missouri's social wasps. A late summer nest bristling with dozens of wasps can be an impressive sight. If you have a garden, however, these wasps are your friends!\nMany species and genera of sand wasps occur in Missouri. They nest in the ground during summer. They are found in many habitats but most often in open, sandy areas along rivers.\nMost ichneumon wasps are harmless, although the long ovipositor of the female is intimidating. Their larvae live as parasites inside caterpillars and other larval insects.\nYellowjackets are bee-sized social wasps that build paper nests, usually underground. Their defensive stinging makes them a major pest when they nest near people. If you want to eliminate a yellowjacket nest, consult a licensed exterminator.\nHorntails look a lot like wasps but have a taillike spine that projects from the tip of the abdomen. Their cylindrical bodies also lack the narrow waist so common in wasps.\nVelvet ants are not true ants. True ants are social insects, while velvet ants are a group of solitary wasps. Female velvet ants are wingless throughout their lives; males are winged.\nA large solitary wasp, the great golden digger wasp is found throughout Missouri. The abdomen is orange in front and black at the end. The head and thorax have golden hairs.

These all live in colonies similar to those of honey bees and ants. The hornet colony is contained inside the nest constructed of paper-like material made from chewed wood fibers mixed with saliva. The nest is composed of 3 or 4 tiers of combs within a thick, multilayered outer shell. A single opening at the bottom allows the hornets to fly in and out. Hornet nests are usually located in wooded areas, attached to a tree branch, but may be attached to shrubs, utility poles or house siding. \nBaldfaced hornets are large, black insects about 7/8 of an inch long with white to cream-colored markings on the front of the head and at the end of the abdomen. Like all wasps, bees and ants, hornets have a complete life cycle of four stages: egg, larva, pupa and adult. The larva is a legless grub reared within cells in the nest. Hornets are beneficial predators that feed on other insects, particularly filth flies and blow flies. \nA colony of social wasps (hornets, yellowjackets and paper wasps) lasts only 1 year. Each nest is built from scratch each year and the previous year's nest can not be reused. Queens are the only members of the colony able to survive the winter. In April or May, each queen selects a suitable location, constructs a small nest and begins raising sterile daughter offspring. These workers take over the duties of enlarging and maintaining the nest, foraging for food and caring for the offspring while the queen functions only to produce more eggs. \nAt first colony growth is slow, but growth increases rapidly by mid-summer as successive broods of workers emerge. Peak worker population is 100 to 400 hornets by the end of the summer. In the fall, males and new queens are produced. These leave the nest, mate and the fertilized queens hibernate. The remainder of the workers, the old queen and the males die of old age or freezing temperatures. \nThe size of a hornet's nest and the hornets' reputation is often sufficient to alarm people. Fortunately, the aggressiveness of hornets does not match their appearance, although disturbing a nest or threatening an individual wasp will result in stings. Hornets are very protective of their colony and will usually attack if someone approaches within 3 feet of the nest. A nest located in a \"high traffic\" area such as along walks or near doorways justifies control to reduce the threat of being stung. Nests away from human activity should be left undisturbed.\n Hornet Control \nBaldfaced hornet colonies are relatively easy to control using one of the several insecticidal aerosol products specifically designed for this purpose. A special nozzle and propellant system spray a thin stream of insecticide up to 20 feet. \nColonies should be exterminated at night, if possible, when workers are least active and the maximum number are at the nest. Safety precautions include protective clothing such as a thick jacket, long pants tucked into socks, gloves and a hat. \nSpray into the entrance hole at first and then thoroughly wet the nest. Do not remove the nest until all wasps are dead. This may take a day or two as some foraging workers may not have been in the nest at the time of treatment. Follow all labeled directions on the insecticide.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nNote: this information is valid for Iowa.

It had died so it was a snake in \r\n perfect condition and I decided I wanted to try and strip it of its \r\n flesh and have this great rattlesnake skeleton. Local yellow jackets I \r\n thought would be the ones to strip away the flesh. Tacked out on piece \r\n of plywood the yellow jackets had more than half of the flesh eaten \r\n whithin a week. I have watched bald faced hornets chase and catch \r\n yellow jackets in my garden over the summers and that same scene \r\n played out with this dead rattlesnake. What was amazing though was the \r\n bald faced hornets started hiding inside the exposed ribcage of the \r\n snake and when the yellow jackets would squeeze thru ribs to tear off \r\n meat inside the hornets would grab them, kill them and squeeze back \r\n out thru ribs with prize in they're jaws. Pretty cool show to watch up \r\n close.

In both species, a solitary queen emerges from hibernation in the early spring. She builds a golf-ball sized nest using chewed wood pulp and raises the first generation of workers on her own. After they emerge, the workers collect food for the next generation of developing workers, while the queen restricts herself to laying eggs. Larvae are fed pre-chewed insects caught by adults, while adults feed on nectar and fruit pulp.\n\r\nThe nest consists of several tiers of comb covered by a round, paper casing with an entrance at the bottom. Nests are typically located about 10 to 12 feet high in tree or shrub branches, although they may be built on the sides of houses. The nest structure grows rapidly since workers continually add to the paper nest as the population grows. As fall approaches, colonies produce males and new queens, which leave the nest to mate. Newly mated queens burrow into the ground where they spend the winter. The workers, males, and the old queen perish in the fall. Nests are not reused.\n\n\n\nYellow jacket eating sugary flesh of a peach \r\nJerry A. Payne, USDA ARS\r\nwww.insectimages.org\nDamage: The bald-faced hornet causes little agricultural or structural damage. Yellow jackets and bald-faced hornets become very numerous towards the end of summer and may be persistent, unwelcome guests at picnics, where they scavenge for food.\nBenefits: Both bald-faced hornets and aerial-nesting yellow jackets control many harmful insects, such as crane flies, flies and caterpillars.\nSting: Both the bald-faced hornet and the aerial-nesting yellow jacket are protective and will sting repeatedly if their nests are disturbed. They do not usually sting when away from the nest. Unlike honey bees, these insects have a smooth stinger and can sting repeatedly. Also, the venom of these wasps is different from that of bees, and may elicit a more painful sting. Check your shrubs for nests before pruning or gardening. If you are stung, cooling the area with ice may be soothing. \nRemember! Insect stings can elicit a life-threatening, allergic reaction in some individuals. Check with your physician to determine what symptoms require a visit to the emergency room. Never attempt any control measure if you have a known allergy to insect stings.\nFurther sources: Akre, R.D., A. Greene, J.F. MacDonald, P.J. Landolt, and H.G. Davis. 1980.

They are known for making large, enclosed paper \nnests that generally consists of a small entrance hole usually near the \nbottom. Larger nests may have more than one entrance hole. \nThe average \nsized nest is about the size of a football, but can get many times \nlarger. The hornets are fast fliers and can quickly swarm any potential \nthreat. They are most aggressive when protecting the nest. \n\n\nTheir bad reputation is well justified when defending the nest. I can \npersonally testify to this because I have been stung multiple times in a\n single attack. \n\nWhen on the attack, they are so fast there is really nothing you can do except run.\n\n\nHornets in Hollywood Movies\nMany Hollywood movies have played on the wasp\u2019s fierce \nreputation. I recall a John Wayne movie that included a scene where a \nbald faced hornet nest was thrown into a train. There was also the movie\n \"Man of the House\" with Jonathon Taylor Thomas and Chevy Chase. In this\n movie, Thomas rigs a trap using a large hornet\u2019s nest that drops onto \nthe bad guys.\nHere's a True Story\nWhen living on the North Fork of the White River in the Missouri Ozarks, a neighbor spotted a bear climbing down from a tree near his house. For some reason he rushed out and hit the bear with a stick to chase him away. The bear ran off. However, unbeknownst to my neighbor, the bear had been swatting at a hornet's nest. As the neighbor was turning to go back to the house, the hornet nest fell from the tree hitting the ground. He was immediately attacked by dozens of angry hornets receiving hundreds of stings. \nWhile it is true that bald faced hornets do have a bad temper when \ntheir nests are disturbed, they are generally not a problem when found \naway from the nest. In fact, bald faced hornets are actually beneficial \ninsects. They kill other small insects, including flies, that are fed to\n the young. Each nest consists of a queen, worker hornets, and drones. \nThe workers are all female and are responsible for all stinging attacks \nand nest building. The drones are all male and have no stinger. Their \njob is to mate with certain females whose offspring will become queens. \nThe female bald faced hornets are often seen on untreated \nwood surfaces. They work tirelessly removing wood fibers used for nest \nconstruction. The nest starts off small, the size of a baseball, \nbecoming oval shaped as it grows. Inside the nest is the standard waffle\n pattern that contains hornet larva. Before summer ends, it can be over \ntwo feet long and hold several hundred hornets.\n\nNests are most often built in trees. When built in \ntrees they become almost invisible. Most people never even know it is \nthere until the leaves drop in the fall. They do not reuse an old nest \nand start with a new nest each year. \nNests are most often built in trees. When built in \ntrees they become almost invisible. Most people never even know it is \nthere until the leaves drop in the fall. They do not reuse an old nest \nand start with a new nest each year. \nBald faced hornet nest removal becomes necessary when the nest is \nclose enough to the house that they become a threat to you or family \nmembers. They will build nests in hedges, on the sides of houses, \nunderneath carports, inside barns, attics, and even the underside of \nsturdy patio furniture. \nHornet Nest Removal \u2013 Pesticides, Safety, and Precautions\nThe hornets must be killed before removing the nest. \nThe easiest method of killing bald faced hornets is to use a \"Wasp and \nHornet\" spray that says \"Immediate Knockdown Power\" or \"Kills on \nContact\" on the label. They can be purchased at most hardware stores and\n even some grocery stores. Don't expect the spray to kill immediately. \n(Their definition of \"immediate\" is different than mine.) Some will \ndrop, some will cling to the nest and some will fly a short distance \neven when coated with spray. \n\nDo not use sprays labeled for flies, mosquitoes, or \nother flying insects. Do not use \"fogger\" type sprays. They don\u2019t have \nthe knockdown power and you will probably get stung. Hornet stings are \npainful, especially multiple stings, so don\u2019t chance it. The product you\n use must be labeled specifically for wasp and hornets.\nDo not allow children to spray the nest, it is a\n job for adults only. Children may not understand the danger involved. \nBee and hornet stings may look cute on  \"America\u2019s Funniest Videos\", but\n if you have ever been attacked, you know it is not that funny.Vegetation DamageThe\n one good thing about the newer cans of hornet and wasp killer sprays was the lack of damage to plant \ntissue. Just 10 years ago, if you sprayed a can of hornet killer into the\n trees, it would kill all the leaves the spray touched. Lately, I have noticed that little\n damage was caused with the hornet sprays I have used. It may not be \nthat way for every type of spray hornet spray. \nDo not use sprays labeled for flies, mosquitoes, or \nother flying insects. Do not use \"fogger\" type sprays. They don\u2019t have \nthe knockdown power and you will probably get stung. Hornet stings are \npainful, especially multiple stings, so don\u2019t chance it.

Children may not understand the danger involved. \nBee and hornet stings may look cute on  \"America\u2019s Funniest Videos\", but\n if you have ever been attacked, you know it is not that funny.\nVegetation Damage\nThe best time to spray is in the morning hours when the air is calm \nand cool. Make sure there is sufficient light to see clearly. Aim the \ncan at the entrance of the nest and continue to spray until the can is \nempty. It will take under a minute. The spray will coat most of the nest\n killing the larva and adults. For large nests have an additional can in\n your other hand ready to spray. You don\u2019t want to run out before the \njob is completed.\nThe inside of the nest will offer some protection from \nthe spray. It may take a couple days before it is safe to approach a \nbald faced hornet nest after it has been sprayed. \nThere will always straggler hornets that will show up at the nest minutes to hours after you have sprayed it. These wasps that arrive later were out working gathering pulp or food. Be on the watch out for them if you decide to remove the nest fairly quickly after spraying. \nCaution: Don't Believe Spray Distance Claims on Can: \nThe picture on the can shows the can shooting a jet stream of spray at the nest. Cans used to do this, but I haven't gotten a can that will shoot a solid jet stream like that. \nAlthough some cans are labeled to shoot up to 27 ft. they are not \naccurate at that distance. Expect the jet stream to start breaking up \nand spreading out at about half the stated distance on the can. I just \ntested (Nov 2012) a can with 27 foot distance claims and it broke up at \nsix feet! Unbelievable! \nWith the slight breeze I got maybe 10 feet out of the stream. You should \nalways test the stream away from the nest first, but only for a second or so. You will loose too much spray if you test the stream too long.\nImportant: The maximum distance from the nest should not be much \nbeyond the point where the stream begins to break up. This is because \nthe stream will need to hit the nest and entrance hole with some force. \nIf the stream breaks up before it hits the nest and only coats the \noutside and will not have any knockdown power. You will likely have to \nspray it again after they have calmed down. \nInstant Kill Claims: I guess it really depends on the \nmanufacturer's definition of \"Instant\", but if a bald-faced hornet flies\n off after being sprayed, it is not instant in my book, even if the \nhornet dies shortly after. Be careful of that.\nIt is very dangerous to use gasoline, kerosene, or \ndiesel fuel. It is dangerous and you can get severely burned if it \nsomehow ignites. Attempts at throwing a bucket of gasoline on the nest \nwill probably get you stung. This is especially true if you miss the \ntarget. You will probably only get one attempt at it.\nIf your plan is to stand in front of the nest to spray, you must dress appropriately.\nWear lots of padding. You should wear at least two \npairs of loose fitting jeans, several shirts or a thick jacket, a large \nbrimmed hat with netting over it. Tape the netting to your jacket or \nshirt while leaving enough slack for bending. Tape off all openings and \nthe bottom of your pants and shirt sleeves. Wear leather gloves.\n\nCaution: A person I know used netting over his \nhat when spraying a hornet\u2019s nest, but the netting was touching the tip \nof his nose. One hornet stung him on the nose through the net. Make sure\n the netting is not resting on your skin.\nHave an escape route established should something go \nwrong. Make sure no one else is in close vicinity when you start \nspraying. Move your pets inside as well. If hornets are anything like \nhoney bees, they will break off the chase before 300 ft. (Not so for \nAfricanized bees where attacks have continued for over 1000 ft.) Make \nsure your escape route is opened ended should you need more distance. \nCaution: A person I know used netting over his \nhat when spraying a hornet\u2019s nest, but the netting was touching the tip \nof his nose.

Make \nsure your escape route is opened ended should you need more distance. \nDepending on the location of the nest, the following advice may be \nhelpful. A few weeks ago I killed a small bald faced hornet nest that \nwas in a shrub several feet from our basement door. I was able to get \nwithin 5 feet of the nest by spraying from inside my car.\nWhat I did was lower my driver\u2019s side window a few inches and placed \nduct tape across the opening leaving a three inch gap in the middle. \nThis small gap is where the can's nozzle is placed. I pulled the car \ndirectly in front of the nest and began spraying. I had one finger on \nthe electric window switch should there have been a need to raise the \nwindow quickly. I didn\u2019t need it. I was able to kill the entire nest and\n took it down two days later. \nImportant Precautions When Spraying From Inside a Car\n\nIt is important to wear eye protection. Since your eyes will \nbe on the nest and not the can, should the can move slightly allowing \nthe stream to hit the tape, it could easily splash pesticide into your \neyes. Place a towel directly under the can before you start \nspraying. Some of the pesticide always drips down the can and could drip\n on the arm rest or elsewhere in the car.Wash off the outside of your car after spraying the nest. You will certainly get pesticide overspray on the paint surface.\nAll About Lawn Grubs\nThere are several species of grubs that can damage turf.

It's easy to \r\n   spot since it's our only black and white yellow jacket. Its nest is a \r\n   gray \"paper\" envelope with several layers of combs inside. \r\n   A mature nest is bigger than a basketball, but pear-shaped, with the \r\n   larger end at the top and an entrance hole near the bottom.\n\r\n   A single, over-wintering queen begins building the nest in the spring. \r\n   She lays eggs and tends the first batch of larvae that develop into \r\n   workers. These workers tend new larvae and expand the nest throughout \r\n   the summer. A mature colony can have several hundred workers by the \r\n   end of the summer. In fall, workers die and next year's queens find\r\n   over-wintering sites.\n\r\n   Baldfaced hornets are beneficial, capturing insects (often including \r\n   other yellowjackets) to feed to their larvae. Though larger than \r\n   other yellowjackets, Baldfaced hornets are generally more docile. But \r\n   they can become aggressive and will sting when their nest is \r\n   disturbed or threatened.\n\r\n   A Baldfaced nest is usually constructed high in a tree. In these \r\n   cases the nest is best left alone. In fact, Baldfaced hornet nests \r\n   are often first noticed in fall when leaves drop, exposing the nest. \r\n   By this time the hornets are dead or dying, and the nest will not be reused.\n\r\n   Occasionally you will find a Baldfaced nest built on the side of a \r\n   building, in low shrubbery, or even in an attic or shed. Nests in \r\n   these sited will probably need to be eliminated.\n\nBald Faced Hornet Elimination\n\r\n    Treat the hornet nest as late in the evening as possible. Remember \r\n    that all wasps, hornets and bees are at rest when it is dark. Not \r\n    only will all the hornets be in the nest for you to exterminate \r\n    (instead of foraging for food some distance away) , you will be at \r\n    far less risk when they are resting. No one wants to treat a hornets' \r\n    nest with hornets dive-bombing their head!\n\r\n    When approaching the nest, move slowly so as not to disturb the \r\n    sleeping pests. If eliminating the nest in late evening is not \r\n    possible (forcing you to work in broad daylight), avoid crossing the \r\n    obvious flight path. You also do not want to cast a shadow across the \r\n    nest while you work.\n\r\n    For initial \"knockdown\" or quick kill, use a professional wasp\r\n     freeze aerosol. This will enable you to attack the nest from a \r\n    distance or reach higher areas without the use of a ladder. The wasp \r\n    freeze should first be directed at the entrance of the nest to \r\n    eliminate any guard wasps. Next, thoroughly soak the remainder of the \r\n    nest. For the average size nest (or larger) you will need two cans of \r\n    wasp freeze. These types of aerosol are not very expensive and you do \r\n    not want to run out of product in the middle of the job!\n\r\n    You can now finish the hornet elimination. This is best done using  \r\n    Drione Dust or Delta Dust. Either one \r\n    of these products will do an excellent job, and they also are \r\n    packaged in a container that allows you to apply the dust directly. \r\n    Ease the tip of your dust container (or Crusader\r\n     Duster, if you prefer) into the entrance and quickly squeeze \r\n    three or four times. This will send the pesticide dust far into the \r\n    galleries, where it will remain long enough to kill all hornets.\n\r\n    After 24 to 48 hours, all hornets should be dead. (If not, you simply \r\n    repeat the dust application). You can now safely remove the empty \r\n    nest. \n\n\n\n\n\r\n    Honey Bees and Yellow Jackets nesting inside walls are best treated \r\n    with Drione Dust or Delta Dust, \r\n    squeezing the dust inside the entry points inside the building.\n\nTo spray small wasp or hornet nests use a solution of Viper before the sun rises in the morning. Thoroughly wet down the nest while all the wasps are sitting on the nest.\n\nTo treat Yellow Jackets or Bumble Bees nesting in the ground use a solution of\r\n   Viper mixed in a bucket. Apply 2-4 gallons of Sniper solution in each nest, depending on the size, before sunrise while all the Yellow Jackets or Bumble Bees are sleeping.\n\n\n\nFollow these links to order your Bald Faced Hornet Control products:\n\n\r\n   Wasp Freeze Aerosol\n\r\n   Delta Dust\nDrione Dust\n\r\n   Crusader Duster\nViper\n\n\n\nBugsaway.com\n\nPest Control Solutions\nfor the Do-It-Yourselfer\n\n1-800-887-2847\n\nProfessional Pest Control Products, Inc.\n5825 Nancy Ave\nColumbus, Ga. 31909\n1/706-682-2314 fax 1/706-221-1918\n\n\n\r\n    Honey Bees and Yellow Jackets nesting inside walls are best treated \r\n    with Drione Dust or Delta Dust, \r\n    squeezing the dust inside the entry points inside the building.\nTo spray small wasp or hornet nests use a solution of Viper before the sun rises in the morning.

It has been named 'Garuda' after the part-human, part-eagle mythical beast\nWhere the wasps were discovered\nEntomologist Lynn Kimsey of the University of California, Davis, encountered the wasps during a recent expedition to the island. \nThe UC Davis Department of Entomology said they picked the name warrior wasp because of its huge ninja-like mandibles. \n\nMs Kimsey, who is also director at the Bohart Museum of Entomology, said: 'Its jaws are so large that they wrap up either side of the head when closed. When the jaws are open they are actually longer than the male's front legs. I don't know how it can walk.'\n Luckily the species prefers to dine on insects, but if threatened it could leave a sizeable mark on human flesh too. \nThe wasp has jaws longer than its legs\nMs Kimsey plans to name it 'Garuda' after the part-human, part-eagle mythical beast that is well-known as a national symbol in Indonesia. \nThe wasp was discovered in the Mekongga Mountains in south-eastern Sulawesi, a little-explored Indonesian island between Borneo and New Guinea.\nMs Kimsey described it as one of the world's top three islands for biodiversity alongside Australia and Madagascar.\nAside from gigantic wasps the island is also home to dwarf buffalo called anoa and colonial spiders whose webs can stretch for acres. \nMs Kimsey and a team of researchers have received a five-year, \u00a32.5 million grant to study the island's rich biodiversity. \nSo far in her three trips to Sulawesi, she estimates that hundreds - maybe even thousands - of new species could be catalogued. \nShe hopes that the discovery of the warrior wasp and other surprising new creatures will help raise awareness about just how unique and precious the region is.\n'There's talk of forming a biosphere reserve to preserve this,' she said.

R. Giger to do the designs, the resulting monsters might have looked something like this. But this \"warrior wasp\" is real: it lives on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, and it is 4 centimetres long.\nIts mandibles are so large that they cross over to the other side of the head when closed - they're longer, in fact, than the wasp's front legs making it difficult to understand how they are able to walk.\nLynn Kimsey of the University of California, Davis discovered the mighty insect during a recent expedition to the Mekongga Mountains of Sulawesi. She plans to name it \"Garuda\", after a mythic figure who was part-human, part-eagle. \nThey don't seem to be a common species, Kimsey says: she only found six individuals in 3 years of searching. Plans to dig an opencast nickel mine in the Mekongga Mountains would be \"bad news\" for the wasps, says Kimsey.\nSurprisingly, perhaps, they are not biggest wasps in the world. That accolade probably goes to one of the tarantula hawks, which regularly clock in at over 6 centimetres, and - as the name suggests - hunt tarantulas.\nIt's interesting that this wasps compound eyes don't nearly encompass the entire head like normal wasps. The eyes on this predatory wasp seem to be directed forward, similar to how a jumping spider's main eyes point forward. Maybe for binocular vision to better judge the distance of it's prey.\nI've seen a 'tarantula hawk' wasp here in Australia. It was dragging a spider that was at least twice the wasp's size. The wasp in question certainly wasn't 6cm long though, so probably one of the smaller species.\nCome to think of it; I haven't seen any of the huntsman spiders that live in my house for several months now. I'm hoping they're hibernating the winter months away somewhere, and haven't ended up as wasp-snacks.\nYes it look like Alien and the name Garuda suits on it.\nKill it with fire!\nThis wasp is awesome to behold! No science fiction writer could come up with such an eerie looking wasp. Too bad only six \"garuda\" wasps have been found. I hope that it survives mankind's now 7 billion individuals.

You can see the size difference in the above picture.\nThe huge wasp was named after \"Garuda,\" a mythical \"winged warrior\" bird from Indonesia.\nEntomologist Michael Ohl identified the pitch black wasp while studying the insect collections at the museum. It was originally collected from Indonesia's Sulawesi Island by Lynn Kimsey of the University of California, Davis.\nMales of this wasp species measure 2.5 inches long, or about the same size as a human ring finger in length. Their jaws are impressively large and are said to be even stronger and longer than the wasp's front legs.\n\"Its body size and jet-black color make this wasp a really disturbing creature,\" Ohl was quoted as saying in the release.\nLittle is known about the wasp's behavior, since it was not observed much in the wild, but it's likely that the big jaws play a role in fighting and mating.\u00a0\nThe wasp is doubly ferocious since it can both sting and inflict a painful bite with its scissor-like jaws.\n\"Its jaws are so large that they wrap up either side of the head when closed,\" Kimsey said.\nShe added, \"When the jaws are open they are actually longer than the male's front legs. I don't know how it can walk.\"\nFemales of this wasp species are formidible too.\nKimsey concluded, \"The females are smaller but still larger than other members of their subfamily.\""], ["Meet Indonesia's H.R. Giger-like warrior wasp - io9", "http://io9.com/5835169/meet-indonesias-hr-giger-like-warrior-wasp", "\nIf someone had made a horror movie about alien wasps and hired H. R. Giger to do the designs, the resulting monsters might have looked something like this. But this \"warrior wasp\" is real: it lives on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, and it is 4 centimetres long.\nIts mandibles are so large that they cross over to the other side of the head when closed - they're longer, in fact, than the wasp's front legs making it difficult to understand how they are able to walk.\nLynn Kimsey of the University of California, Davis discovered the mighty insect during a recent expedition to the Mekongga Mountains of Sulawesi. She plans to name it \"Garuda\", after a mythic figure who was part-human, part-eagle.\nThey don't seem to be a common species, Kimsey says: she only found six individuals in 3 years of searching. Plans to dig an opencast nickel mine in the Mekongga Mountains would be \"bad news\" for the wasps, says Kimsey.\nSurprisingly, perhaps, they are not biggest wasps in the world. That accolade probably goes to one of the tarantula hawks, which regularly clock in at over 6 centimetres, and - as the name suggests - hunt tarantulas.\nImage: Kathy Keatley Garvey.

That\u2019s not the case for entomologist Justin O. Schmidt. That\u2019s because Dr. Schmidt has dedicated his life to studying venomous hymenopterans, the order of insects made up of ants, bees, and wasps. Through his research, he has been stung countless times. As a result, he developed the Schmidt Sting Pain Index.\nI stumbled upon Schmidt\u2019s work after seeing this video of warrior wasps. One of the noteworthy characteristics of warrior wasps is that when threatened, they rhythmically flap their wings against their bodies in perfect synchrony, producing a sound not unlike marching soldiers. The other characteristic these wasps are known for is a sting that hurts!\nJust how much does a sting from a warrior wasp hurt? According to the pain index developed by Schmidt, the warrior wasp tops in at a 4 - the highest level of pain in the scale. What\u2019s more, the excruciating pain will last at least 60 minutes before subsiding even the slightest.\nThe warrior wasp is not the most painful sting recorded in Schmidt\u2019s index, however. In fact, it pales in comparison to some other insect stings. To date, Schmidt has cataloged the painful stings of nearly 80 different hymenopteran species, from various ants to the giant Asian hornet.\nSo which venomous insect is really the king of sting? I\u2019ve turned Schmidt\u2019s data into this visualization to help you decide.\nIn addition to the data provided by Schmidt, I\u2019ve added the common name of the insect, or the group to which it belongs, where possible. Due to Schmidt\u2019s expertise and rigor, many of the species listed are not commonly known. For these, I was unable to track down any common identifier.\nPain is subjective. It\u2019s possible that one person might prefer a short-lived category 4 sting over a longer, weaker category 1 or 2 sting. According to these data however, the bullet ant (Paraponera clavata) is the clear winner. The immediate category 4 pain from a bullet ant lasts for 5 hours! It then takes 24 hours to subside, with residual pain reported up to two weeks later. No wonder it is considered the most painful sting not just among hymenopterans, but all other insects!\nSuch a powerful sting has earned the bullet ant a place among the Satere-Mawe, a tribe in the Brazilian Amazon rain forest. During their coming-of-age initiation, young members of the Satere-Mawe wear mittens lined with bullet ants. For 10 minutes  initiates dance in the stinging mittens to prove their courage. They must do this not once, but 20 times before completing their ceremonial journey.\nIn addition to the subjective nature of pain, location matters when it comes to insect stings [3]. Using honey bees as a baseline, Michael L. Smith tested the variance of Schmidt\u2019s Pain Index based on where the sting occurred. According to Smith\u2019s research, the nostril was the worst place to be stung, followed by the upper lip.\nThe timing of the sting and number of subsequent stings were not significant factors in pain level. Smith hypothesizes the important role of location is due to naturally protected areas that are rarely stimulated (e.g. nostrils) and soft areas that enable greater penetration. Even in its most sensitive locations, Smith notes that the human body has defenses:\nStings to the nostril were especially violent, immediately inducing sneezing, tears and a copious flow of mucus. The sting did autotomize in the nostril (self-severed when the bee was pulled away). The copious mucus flow, however, may help prevent subsequent stings to the area during a natural attack. (p. 6)\nIn the United States, bee and wasp stings are responsible for the deaths of about 40 people each year. This makes bees more deadly than dogs, spiders, and snakes [2]. Even sharks, which are one of the most feared animals in the world, have only killed 3 people in the US during the years 2006 - 2010.\nNearly all of the deaths related to bee stings are the result of anaphylaxis, which is a severe allergic reaction that can lead to difficulty in breathing, dizziness, unconsciousness, and ultimately death. Anaphylaxis is the result of compounds in the insects' venom that are not related to the amount of pain inflicted. As a result, the Schmidt Pain Index is not an indicator of how deadly an animal is to humans. Small bees (pain level 1-2) kill far more people than the bullet ant (level 4).\nThe deadliness of smaller, less painful insects has more to do with their behavior and the likelihood of an encounter. Africanized honey bees - the famed \u201ckiller bees\u201d - are particularly deadly because of their aggressive swarming characteristics. They are easier to provoke, attack in large numbers, and are known to chase their targets for long distances. Just last year, a man in Texas was killed after a swarm of nearly 40,000 killer bees descended upon him.\nJust as location affects pain, the biochemistry of the species' venom influences its lethality. Each species has a slightly different arrangement of enzymes in their venom, making some more lethal than others. In addition, each species injects a different amount of their venom, per sting. For example, the Honey bee injects 0.05mg of venom per sting while the fire ant can inject up to 0.1mg [3]. Typically, insects sting other insects or smaller animals that attempt to prey on them, so their venom has not evolved for the purpose of killing humans. But with a high enough dose - delivered by the right number of stings, hymenopteran venom can be lethal. Just how much does it take?\nThese data show the amount of venom required for death to occur as a result of the venom alone. Secondary effects, such as anaphylaxis, are not included.\nDon\u2019t be tricked by the Giant hornet\u2019s heavy-handed dose, however. Even though it can kill with the fewest stings, the fact that it delivers far more venom than the others means that, relatively speaking, its venom is not the most potent. To be lethal to a 50kg human, the Giant hornet must inject a total of 229.6 mg of venom. In contrast, a honey bee needs to inject only 175 mg of its venom. The graph below shows how these venoms stack up in terms of potency.\nWith its high potency venom and greater likelihood to be encountered, its easy to see why the honey bee kills far more people than the giant hornet or any other hymenopteran!\n\nAlthough it is responsible for the most deaths and has more potent venom than some similar species, even the honey bee has weak venom compared to the most potent of all hymenopterans. That honor goes to the Maricopa harvester ant. This species of ant has a venom that is nearly 30x more potent than the honey bee, making its venom the most potent of all insects.\nIt\u2019s one thing to have the most potent insect venom. Having the most potent venom in the animal kingdom is another. How does the Maricopa harvester ant compare to the world\u2019s most toxic snake and the poison dart frog? I wondered that too. As it turns out, it\u2019s not even close.\nThe poison dart frog is more potent than any snake, spider, or ant venom. It even leaves the infamous Irukandji  box jellyfish and venomous cone snails (not pictured) in the dust.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note the difference between poison and venom. Both are toxins that are produced to either protect the animal in defensive situations, or to help capture prey. The key difference is that venom is injectected while poison is injested. In other words, if it bites you and you die: it\u2019s venomous. If you bite it and you die: it\u2019s poisonous.\nFortunately for us the poison dart frog fits in the latter category.\nAside from their interestingness, these data shattered a few of my preconceptions about insect stings. Being in the outdoors often has given me my fair share of stings and encounters with various bees, wasps, and hornets. Among all of these, I avoided hornets the most (the bald-faced hornet is common in every area I\u2019ve lived). I\u2019m willing to bet that many others also view hornets as nastier, more painful stingers than other wasps and bees.\nBut according to the data, that needn\u2019t be so. These hornets are no more painful than the common yellowjackets and bumble bees that frequent backyards and gardens. In fact, the pain subsides more quickly and their venom is much weaker. \nSo what gives? Why would we fear the insects we see less frequently (such as hornets) while remaining comfortable around those most common to us (like honey bees) - despite the latter being more painful stingers and even more deadly? Personally, I think the question reveals the answer. As in many situations, it seems that fear of the unknown outweighs reality. \nWhile I won\u2019t be hunting for a pet hornet anytime soon, I\u2019m glad I took a look at these data and hope some of the findings were as eye-opening to you as they were for me.\n[1] Schmidt, J.

The nest architecture is similar in all species: arboreal, usually on a broad slanting surface and with a single sessile comb attached directly to the tree trunk (Wenzel 1998). The genus was recently subject of a phylogenetic analysis, being supported as monophyletic (Andena et al. 2009).\nAlthough four species of Synoeca have been recorded in Brazil, Synoeca septentrionalis was previously recorded only from North and Central America (Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Nicaragua and Panama) and northwestern South America (Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia) (Richards 1978; Andena et al. 2009; Cely and Sarmiento 2011). Active nests of Synoeca septentrionalis were discovered and collectedin Atlantic Rain Forest in Itabuna (14\u00b047'S, 39\u00b016'W) and Santa Terezinha (12\u00b046'S, 39\u00b031'W), Bahia State, and in Alfredo Chaves (20\u00b038'S, 40\u00b045'W), Esp\u00edrito Santo State.\nThe nests collected present a longitudinal groove extending from top to bottom, and a central-dorsal ridge (Fig. 1). Richards (1978: 181) reported similar nests features in Synoeca septentrionalis collected in Cali (Colombia). The nest of Synoeca surinama is similar to Synoeca septentrionalis with a central-dorsal ridge (Castellon, 1980: fig. 5). However, nest of Synoeca surinama has a keel instead of a groove. The nests were found attached to tree trunks (Santa Terezinha c. 1, 70 m from the ground and two combs; Itabuna c. 6 m from the ground and one comb) and attached on the rock (Alfredo Chaves c. 2, 10 m from the ground and two combs). Elisei et al. (2005) and Sidnei Mateus (pers. com.) also recorded nests of Synoeca cyanea attached on the rock in the states of Minas Gerais and Mato Grosso.\nSynoeca septentrionalis is easily diagnosed by the presence of the outstanding erect hairs on the first metasomal tergum and sternum and by a dark triangular area in clypeus (Richards 1978; Andena et al. 2009). However, variation in the clypeus color pattern was observed. The nest collected in Santa Terezinha had eight females with clypeus entirely reddish, two females with clypeus reddish with a dorsal dark area, eight males with clypeus reddish with a triangular dorsal dark area, and five males with the clypeus reddish with a dark dorsal area. The specimens collected in Alfredo Chaves (eigth females) and Itabuna (14 females) had the clypeus entirely reddish. Richards (1978: 181) also reported variation in clypeus color in specimens collected in Ecuador and Colombia.\nVoucher specimens are deposited at Entomological Collections at the Universidade Estadual de Santa Cruz, Ilh\u00e9us, Brazil and at the Universidade Estadual de Feira de Santana (MZUEFS), Feira de Santana, Brazil. Despite the male genitalia have been cited by Richards (1978) and used in a phylogenetic analysis by Andena et al. (2009) we also provided detailed drawings of this structure (Fig. 2).\nThis finding extends geographical distribution of Synoeca septentrionalis to Northeast and Southeast regions of Brazil, and represents the first record for Synoeca septentrionalis in the Brazilian Atlantic Rain forest, raising to three the number of Synoeca species known from Bahia State, Synoeca cyanea (Richards 1978; Santos et al. 2007), Synoeca surinama (Richards 1978), and Synoeca septentrionalis.\nGeographic distribution of other Epiponini, Epipona media Cooper, previously described to range from Ecuador, Peru and Brazilian Amazon to the state of Goi\u00e1s was recently extended to Atlantic Rain Forest by Menezes et al. (2010). These data suggest that more exhaustive sampling in this region are needed to provide a diagnosis of the distribution of species, and a frame of the diversity in the biome of Atlantic Rain Forest for its preservation.\nEDIT: Also found this on their venom, which sounds ghastly.\nThe venom of social wasps has been poorly studied so far, despite the high number of accidents in humans and assessment of the use of these wasps as a biological control of pests. The study of the pharmacological effects of the venom is of great importance since the poisoning is dangerous causing serious systemic effects, including death in the case of multiple attacks. In this study, the pharmacological activities of venom from the social wasp Synoeca cyanea were evaluated by the following assays: LD50 in mice, the behavioural effects and the hemorrhagic activity induced by the venom in mice, the oedematogenic activity in rat, the haemolysis in human blood, the stimulating effect on guinea-pig smooth muscle, and the antimicrobial activity. The aim was to determine the toxic effects of venom and to perform a comparative study with earlier work conducted with venom from other wasp species. Results showed that S. cyanea venom produced a potent dose-dependent oedema, as well as antibacterial and haemolytic activities, suggesting the presence of histamine, serotonin, kinins and other molecules related to increased vascular permeability and cytolytic activity in this venom. Despite previous studies with wasp venoms, S. cyanea venom presented a slight hemorrhagic effect. Data obtained in the smooth muscle assay also suggest the presence of BK or analogues in S. cyanea whole venom. The knowledge of symptoms and effects produced by S. cyanea venom is critical for health organizations, in order to improve clinical treatment in accidents caused by wasp stings.\n\n[\u2013]ampanmdagaba 0 points1 point2 points 1 year ago\u00a0(0 children)sorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted on\nThank you, I hoped to find more information about the species here, as googling for the species name from the video only brings more links to the same video.\n\n[\u2013]adaminc 5 points6 points7 points 1 year ago*\u00a0(2 children)sorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted on\nMaybe the noise they are making is a count down, and when they get to a certain number, they all attack.\nI counted about 50 steps which started at 1:00\n\n[\u2013]JerbaJerba -2 points-1 points0 points 1 year ago\u00a0(1 child)sorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted on\nI've been reading about logical fallacies recently.

Honey bees are the only extant members of the tribe Apini, all in the genus Apis. Currently, only seven species of honey bee are recognized, with a total of 44 subspecies,[1] though historically, from six to 11 species have been recognised. Honey bees represent only a small fraction of the roughly 20,000 known species of bees. Some other types of related bees produce and store honey, but only members of the genus Apis are true honey bees. The study of honey bees is known as apiology.\n\n\nHoney bees appear to have their center of origin in South and Southeast Asia (including the Philippines), as all but one (i.e. Apis mellifera), of the extant species are native to that region. Notably, living representatives of the earliest lineages to diverge (Apis florea and Apis andreniformis) have their center of origin there.[2]\nThe first Apis bees appear in the fossil record at the Eocene\u2013Oligocene boundary (23\u201356 Mya), in European deposits. The origin of these prehistoric honey bees does not necessarily indicate Europe as the place of origin of the genus, only that it occurred there then. A few fossil deposits are known from South Asia, the suspected region of honey bee origin, and fewer still have been thoroughly studied.\nNo Apis species existed in the New World during human times before the introduction of A. mellifera by Europeans. Only one fossil species is documented from the New World, Apis nearctica, known from a single 14-million-year old specimen from Nevada.[3]\nThe close relatives of modern honey bees\u2014e.g. bumblebees and stingless bees\u2014are also social to some degree, and social behavior seems a plesiomorphic trait that predates the origin of the genus. Among the extant members of Apis, the more basal species make single, exposed combs, while the more recently evolved species nest in cavities and have multiple combs, which has greatly facilitated their domestication.\nMost species have historically been cultured or at least exploited for honey and beeswax by humans indigenous to their native ranges. Only two of these species have been truly domesticated, one (A. mellifera) at least since the time of the building of the Egyptian pyramids, and only that species has been moved extensively beyond its native range.\nToday's honey bees constitute three clades.[1][4]\nThe chromosome counts of female bees for the three clades are Micrapis 2N=16, Megapis 2N=16, Apis 2N=32. Drones of all species have 1N chromosome counts. The genome of Apis has been mapped.\nDrones (males) are produced from unfertilized eggs, so represent only the DNA of the queen that laid the eggs, i.e. have only a mother. Workers and queens (both female) result from fertilized eggs, so have both a mother and a father. A modified form of parthenogenesis controls sex differentiation. The sex allele is polymorphic, and so long as two different variants are present, a female bee results. If both sex alleles are identical, diploid drones are produced. Honey bees detect and destroy diploid drones after the eggs hatch.\nQueens typically mate with multiple drones on more than one mating flight. Once mated, they lay eggs and fertilize them as needed from sperm stored in the spermatheca. Since the number of sex alleles is limited\u2014about 18 are known in Apis\u2014a queen will most likely mate with one or more drones having sex alleles identical with one of the sex alleles in the queen. The queen, then, typically produces a percentage of diploid drone eggs.\nApis florea and Apis andreniformis are small honey bees of southern and southeastern Asia. They make very small, exposed nests in trees and shrubs. Their stings are often incapable of penetrating human skin, so the hive and swarms can be handled with minimal protection. They occur largely sympatrically, though they are very distinct evolutionarily and are probably the result of allopatric speciation, their distribution later converging. Given that A. florea is more widely distributed and A. andreniformis is considerably more aggressive, honey is, if at all, usually harvested from the former only. They are the most ancient extant lineage of honey bees, maybe diverging in the Bartonian (some 40 million years ago or slightly later) from the other lineages, but do not seem to have diverged from each other a long time before the Neogene.[4]\nOne species is recognized in the subgenus Megapis. It usually builds single or a few exposed combs on high tree limbs, on cliffs, and sometimes on buildings. They can be very fierce. Periodically robbed of their honey by human \"honey hunters\", colonies are easily capable of stinging a human being to death if provoked.\nThe eastern species include three or four species. The reddish Koschevnikov's bee (Apis koschevnikovi) from Borneo is well distinct; it probably derives from the first colonization of the island by cave-nesting honey bees. Apis cerana, the eastern honey bee proper, is the traditional honey bee of southern and eastern Asia, kept in hives in a similar fashion to A. mellifera, though on a much smaller and regionalised scale. It has not been possible yet to resolve its relationship to the Bornean A. c. nuluensis and Apis nigrocincta from the Philippines to satisfaction; the most recent hypothesis is that these are indeed distinct species, but that A. cerana is still paraphyletic, consisting of several good species.[4]\nA. mellifera, the most common domesticated species, was the third insect to have its genome mapped. It seems to have originated in eastern tropical Africa and spread from there to Northern Europe and eastwards into Asia to the Tien Shan range. It is variously called the European, western or common honey bee in different parts of the world. Many subspecies have adapted to the local geographic and climatic environments; in addition, hybrid strains, such as the Buckfast bee, have been bred. Behavior, color, and anatomy can be quite different from one subspecies or even strain to another.\nRegarding phylogeny, this is the most enigmatic honey bee species. It seems to have diverged from its eastern relatives only during the Late Miocene. This would fit the hypothesis that the ancestral stock of cave-nesting honey bees was separated into the western group of East Africa and the eastern group of tropical Asia by desertification in the Middle East and adjacent regions, which caused declines of food plants and trees that provided nest sites, eventually causing gene flow to cease. The diversity of subspecies is probably the product of a largely Early Pleistocene radiation aided by climate and habitat changes during the last ice age. That the western honey bee has been intensively managed by humans for many millennia \u2013 including hybridization and introductions \u2013 has apparently increased the speed of its evolution and confounded the DNA sequence data to a point where little of substance can be said about the exact relationships of many A. mellifera subspecies.[4]\nApis mellifera is not native to the Americas, so was not present upon the arrival of the European explorers and colonists. However, other native bee species were kept and traded by indigenous peoples.[6] In 1622, European colonists brought the dark bee (A. m. mellifera) to the Americas, followed later by Italian bees (A. m. ligustica) and others. Many of the crops that depend on honey bees for pollination have also been imported since colonial times. Escaped swarms (known as \"wild\" bees, but actually feral) spread rapidly as far as the Great Plains, usually preceding the colonists. Honey bees did not naturally cross the Rocky Mountains; they were transported by the Mormon pioneers[7] to Utah in the late 1840s, and by ship to California in the early 1850s.\nAfricanized bees (known colloquially as \"killer bees\") are hybrids between European stock and one of the African subspecies A. m. scutellata; they are often more aggressive than and do not create as much of a surplus as European bees, but are more resistant to disease and are better foragers.[citation needed] Originating by accident in Brazil, they have spread to North America and constitute a pest in some regions. However, these strains do not overwinter well, so are not often found in the colder, more northern parts of North America. The original breeding experiment for which the African bees were brought to Brazil in the first place has continued (though not as intended). Novel hybrid strains of domestic and redomesticated Africanized bees combine high resilience to tropical conditions and good yields. They are popular among beekeepers in Brazil.\nTwo species of honey bee, A. mellifera and A. cerana indica, are often maintained, fed, and transported by beekeepers. Modern hives also enable beekeepers to transport bees, moving from field to field as the crop needs pollinating and allowing the beekeeper to charge for the pollination services they provide, revising the historical role of the self-employed beekeeper, and favoring large-scale commercial operations.\nBeekeepers in Western countries have been reporting slow declines of stocks for many years, apparently due to impaired protein production, changes in agricultural practice, or unpredictable weather. In early 2007, abnormally high die-offs (30\u201370% of hives) of European honey bee colonies occurred in North America; such a decline seems unprecedented in recent history. This has been dubbed \"colony collapse disorder\" (CCD); it is unclear whether this is simply an accelerated phase of the general decline due to stochastically more adverse conditions in 2006, or a novel phenomenon. Research has so far failed to determine what causes it, but the weight of evidence is tentatively leaning towards CCD being a syndrome rather than a disease, as it seems to be caused by a combination of various contributing factors rather than a single pathogen or poison. However, in April of 2013, after a report was released by the European Food Safety Authority identifying the significant risks of the class of pesticides called neonicotinoids, the European Union called for a two-year restriction on neonicotinoid pesticides.[8]\nAs in a few other types of eusocial bees, a colony generally contains one queen bee, a fertile female; seasonally up to a few thousand drone bees or fertile males;[9] and a large seasonally variable population of sterile female worker bees. Details vary among the different species of honey bees, but common features include:\n1. Eggs are laid singly in a cell in a wax honeycomb, produced and shaped by the worker bees. Using her spermatheca, the queen actually can choose to fertilize the egg she is laying, usually depending on into which cell she is laying. Drones develop from unfertilised eggs and are haploid, while females (queens and worker bees) develop from fertilised eggs and are diploid. Larvae are initially fed with royal jelly produced by worker bees, later switching to honey and pollen. The exception is a larva fed solely on royal jelly, which will develop into a queen bee. The larva undergoes several moultings before spinning a cocoon within the cell, and pupating.\n2. Young worker bees clean the hive and feed the larvae. When their royal jelly-producing glands begin to atrophy, they begin building comb cells. They progress to other within-colony tasks as they become older, such as receiving nectar and pollen from foragers, and guarding the hive. Later still, a worker takes her first orientation flights and finally leaves the hive and typically spends the remainder of her life as a forager.\n3. Worker bees cooperate to find food and use a pattern of \"dancing\" (known as the bee dance or waggle dance) to communicate information regarding resources with each other; this dance varies from species to species, but all living species of Apis exhibit some form of the behavior. If the resources are very close to the hive, they may also exhibit a less specific dance commonly known as the \"round dance\".\n4. Honey bees also perform tremble dances, which recruit receiver bees to collect nectar from returning foragers.\n5. Virgin queens go on mating flights away from their home colony to a drone congregation area, and mate with multiple drones before returning. The drones die in the act of mating. Queen honey bees do not mate with drones from their home colony.\n6. Colonies are established not by solitary queens, as in most bees, but by groups known as \"swarms\", which consist of a mated queen and a large contingent of worker bees. This group moves en masse to a nest site scouted by worker bees beforehand. Once they arrive, they immediately construct a new wax comb and begin to raise new worker brood. This type of nest founding is not seen in any other living bee genus, though several groups of vespid wasps also found new nests by swarming (sometimes including multiple queens). Also, stingless bees will start new nests with large numbers of worker bees, but the nest is constructed before a queen is escorted to the site, and this worker force is not a true \"swarm\".\nIn cold climates, honey bees stop flying when the temperature drops below about 10\u00a0\u00b0C (50\u00a0\u00b0F) and crowd into the central area of the hive to form a \"winter cluster\". The worker bees huddle around the queen bee at the center of the cluster, shivering to keep the center between 27\u00a0\u00b0C (81\u00a0\u00b0F) at the start of winter (during the broodless period) and 34\u00a0\u00b0C (93\u00a0\u00b0F) once the queen resumes laying. The worker bees rotate through the cluster from the outside to the inside so that no bee gets too cold. The outside edges of the cluster stay at about 8\u20139\u00a0\u00b0C (46\u201348\u00a0\u00b0F). The colder the weather is outside, the more compact the cluster becomes. During winter, they consume their stored honey to produce body heat. The amount of honey consumed during the winter is a function of winter length and severity, but ranges in temperate climates from 15 to 50\u00a0kg (30 to 100 pounds).[10]\nSpecies of Apis are generalist floral visitors, and will pollinate a large variety of plants, but by no means all plants. Of all the honey bee species, only Apis mellifera has been used extensively for commercial pollination of crops and other plants. The value of these pollination services is commonly measured in the billions of dollars. Bees collect 66 pounds of pollen per year, per hive.[11]\nHoney is the complex substance made when the nectar and sweet deposits from plants and trees are gathered, modified, and stored in the honeycomb by honey bees as a food source for the colony. All living species of Apis have had their honey gathered by indigenous peoples for consumption, though for commercial purposes, only A. mellifera and A. cerana have been utilized to any degree. Honey is sometimes also gathered by humans from the nests of various stingless bees.\nIn 1911, a bee culturist estimated a quart (about a litre) of honey represented bees flying over an estimated 48,000 miles to gather the nectar needed to produce the honey.[12]\nNectar, a liquid high in sucrose, is produced in plant glands known as nectaries. It is an important energy resource for honey bees and plays a significant role in foraging economics and evolutionary differentiation between different subspecies. It was proposed through an experiment conducted with the African honey bee, A. m. scutellata, that nectar temperature impacts the foraging decisions of honey bees.[13]\nWorker bees of a certain age will secrete beeswax from a series of glands on their abdomens. They use the wax to form the walls and caps of the comb. As with honey, beeswax is gathered by humans for various purposes.\nBees collect pollen in the pollen basket and carry it back to the hive. In the hive, pollen is used as a protein source necessary during brood-rearing. In certain environments, excess pollen can be collected from the hives of A. mellifera and A. cerana. It is often eaten as a health supplement. It also has been used with moderate success as a source of pollen for hand pollination However, pollen collected by bees and harvested for pollination must be used within a few hours because it loses its potency rapidly, possibly because of the effects of enzymes or other chemicals from the bees; hand-collected pollen may remain usable for weeks, if stored promptly under suitable conditions.\nPropolis or bee glue is created from resins, balsams, and tree saps. Those species of honey bees that nest in tree cavities use propolis to seal cracks in the hive. Dwarf honey bees use propolis to defend against ants by coating the branch from which their nest is suspended to create a sticky moat. Propolis is consumed by humans as a health supplement in various ways and also used in some cosmetics.\nThe two sexes of honey bee are: females (workers and queens) and males (or drones). A caste is a different form, morphologically or reproductively, within the same sex of a species. In sum, the three types of honey bees are drones, workers, and queens, and two female castes: queens and workers.\nMales or drones are typically haploid, having only one set of chromosomes. They are produced by the queen if she chooses not to fertilize an egg; or by an unfertilized laying worker. Diploid drones may be produced if an egg is fertilized but is homozygous for the sex-determination allele. Drones take 24 days to develop and may be produced from summer through autumn. Drones have large eyes used to locate queens during mating flights. Drones do not have a sting.\nWorkers are female bees and have two sets of chromosomes. They are produced from an egg that the queen has selectively fertilized from stored sperm. Workers typically develop in 21 days. A typical colony may contain as many as 60,000 worker bees. Workers exhibit a wider range of behaviors than either queens or drones. Their duties change upon the age of the bee in the following order (beginning with cleaning out their own cell after eating through their capped brood cell): feed brood, receive nectar, clean hive, guard duty, and foraging. Some workers engage in other specialized behaviors, such as \"undertaking\" (removing corpses of their nestmates from inside the hive).\nWorkers have morphological specializations, including the corbiculum or pollen basket, abdominal glands that produce beeswax, brood-feeding glands, and barbs on the sting. Under certain conditions (for example, if the colony becomes queenless), a worker may develop ovaries.\nQueen honey bees, like workers, are female. They are created at the decision of the worker bees by feeding a larva only royal jelly throughout its development, rather than switching from royal jelly to pollen once the larva grows past a certain size. Queens are produced in oversized cells and develop in only 16 days. Queens have a different morphology and behavior from worker bees. In addition to the greater size of the queen, she has a functional set of ovaries, and a spermatheca, which stores and maintains sperm after she has mated. The sting of queens is not barbed like a worker's sting, and queens lack the glands that produce beeswax. Once mated, queens may lay up to 2,000 eggs per day. They produce a variety of pheromones that regulate behavior of workers, and helps swarms track the queen's location during the migratory phase.\nAll honey bees live in colonies where the workers sting intruders as a form of defense, and alarmed bees release a pheromone that stimulates the attack response in other bees. The different species of honey bees are distinguished from all other bee species (and virtually all other Hymenoptera) by the possession of small barbs on the sting, but these barbs are found only in the worker bees. The sting and associated venom sac of honey bees are also modified so as to pull free of the body once lodged (autotomy), and the sting apparatus has its own musculature and ganglion, which allow it to keep delivering venom once detached. The worker dies after the sting becomes lodged and is subsequently torn loose from the bee's abdomen. The honey bee's venom, known as apitoxin, carries several active components, the most abundant of which is melittin, and the most destructive Phospholipase A2.\nThis complex apparatus, including the barbs on the sting, is thought to have evolved specifically in response to predation by vertebrates, as the barbs do not usually function (and the sting apparatus does not detach) unless the sting is embedded in fleshy tissue. While the sting can also penetrate the membranes between joints in the exoskeleton of other insects (and is used in fights between queens), in the case of Apis cerana japonica, defense against larger insects such as predatory wasps (e.g. Asian giant hornet) is usually performed by surrounding the intruder with a mass of defending worker bees, which vibrate their muscles vigorously to raise the temperature of the intruder to a lethal level.[14] Previously, heat alone was thought to be responsible for killing intruding wasps, but recent experiments have demonstrated the increased temperature in combination with increased carbon dioxide levels within the ball produce the lethal effect.[15][16] This phenomenon is also used to kill a queen perceived as intruding or defective, an action known to beekeepers as 'balling the queen', named for the ball of bees formed.\nIn the case of those honey bee species with open combs (e.g., A. dorsata), would-be predators are given a warning signal that takes the form of a \"Mexican wave\" that spreads as a ripple across a layer of bees densely packed on the surface of the comb when a threat is perceived, and consists of bees momentarily arching their bodies and flicking their wings.[17]\nHoney bees are known to communicate through many different chemicals and odors, as is common in insects, but also using specific behaviours that convey information about the quality and type of resources in the environment, and where these resources are located. The details of the signalling being used vary from species to species; for example, the two smallest species, Apis andreniformis and A. florea, dance on the upper surface of the comb, which is horizontal (not vertical, as in other species), and worker bees orient the dance in the actual compass direction of the resource to which they are recruiting.\nApis mellifera carnica honey bees use their antennae asymmetrically for social interactions with a strong lateral preference to use their right antenna.[18][19]\nBoth the Atharva Veda[20] and the ancient Greeks associated lips anointed with honey with the gift of eloquence and even of prescience. The priestess at Delphi was the \"Delphic Bee\". The Quran has a chapter titled \"The Bee\".\nA community of honey bees has often been employed throughout history by political theorists as a model of human society:\nThis image occurs in Aristotle and Plato; in Virgil[21] and Seneca; in Erasmus and Shakespeare; in Marx and Tolstoy.[22]\nHoney bees, signifying immortality and resurrection, were royal emblems of the Merovingians, revived by Napoleon.[23] The bee also is the heraldic emblem of the Barberini."], ["Honeybee Facts - Back Yard Beekeepers Association", "http://www.backyardbeekeepers.com/facts.html", "\n<!--\nMSFPhover = \n  (((navigator.appName == \"Netscape\") && \n  (parseInt(navigator.appVersion) >= 3 )) || \n  ((navigator.appName == \"Microsoft Internet Explorer\") && \n  (parseInt(navigator.appVersion) >= 4 ))); \nfunction MSFPpreload(img) \n{\n  var a=new Image(); a.src=img; return a; \n}\n// --><!--\nif(MSFPhover) { MSFPnav1n=MSFPpreload(\"_derived/home_cmp_byba010_vbtn.gif\"); MSFPnav1h=MSFPpreload(\"_derived/home_cmp_byba010_vbtn_a.gif\"); }\n// --><!--\nif(MSFPhover) { MSFPnav2n=MSFPpreload(\"_derived/howtojoin.html_cmp_byba010_vbtn.gif\"); MSFPnav2h=MSFPpreload(\"_derived/howtojoin.html_cmp_byba010_vbtn_a.gif\"); }\n// --><!--\nif(MSFPhover) { MSFPnav3n=MSFPpreload(\"_derived/calendar.html_cmp_byba010_vbtn.gif\"); MSFPnav3h=MSFPpreload(\"_derived/calendar.html_cmp_byba010_vbtn_a.gif\"); }\n// --><!--\nif(MSFPhover) { MSFPnav4n=MSFPpreload(\"_derived/benefits.html_cmp_byba010_vbtn.gif\"); MSFPnav4h=MSFPpreload(\"_derived/benefits.html_cmp_byba010_vbtn_a.gif\"); }\n// --><!--\nif(MSFPhover) { MSFPnav5n=MSFPpreload(\"_derived/community.html_cmp_byba010_vbtn.gif\"); MSFPnav5h=MSFPpreload(\"_derived/community.html_cmp_byba010_vbtn_a.gif\"); }\n// --><!--\nif(MSFPhover) { MSFPnav6n=MSFPpreload(\"_derived/board.html_cmp_byba010_vbtn.gif\"); MSFPnav6h=MSFPpreload(\"_derived/board.html_cmp_byba010_vbtn_a.gif\"); }\n// --><!--\nif(MSFPhover) { MSFPnav7n=MSFPpreload(\"_derived/speaker.html_cmp_byba010_vbtn.gif\"); MSFPnav7h=MSFPpreload(\"_derived/speaker.html_cmp_byba010_vbtn_a.gif\"); }\n// --><!--\nif(MSFPhover) { MSFPnav8n=MSFPpreload(\"_derived/to-do.html_cmp_byba010_vbtn.gif\"); MSFPnav8h=MSFPpreload(\"_derived/to-do.html_cmp_byba010_vbtn_a.gif\"); }\n// --><!--\nif(MSFPhover) { MSFPnav9n=MSFPpreload(\"_derived/findclub.html_cmp_byba010_vbtn.gif\"); MSFPnav9h=MSFPpreload(\"_derived/findclub.html_cmp_byba010_vbtn_a.gif\"); }\n// -->\n\n\u00a0\n    \n    \n\nTechnical comments may be directed to ljhuston3@charter.net\n\nFACTS\nABOUT HONEYBEES\nPollination\n\nAgriculture depends greatly on the honeybee for pollination. Honeybees account for 80% of all insect pollination. Without such pollination,\nwe would see a significant decrease in the yield of fruits and vegetables.\nPollen\nBees collect 66 lbs of pollen per year, per hive. Pollen is the\nmale germ cells produced by all flowering plants for fertilization\nand plant embryo formation. The Honeybee uses pollen as a food.\nPollen is one of the richest and purest natural foods, consisting\nof up to 35% protein, 10% sugars, carbohydrates, enzymes, minerals,\nand vitamins A (carotenes), B1 (thiamin), B2 (riboflavin), B3\n(nicotinic acid), B5 (panothenic acid), C (ascorbic acid), H (biotin),\nand R (rutine).\nHoney\nHoney is used by the bees for food all year round. There are many\ntypes, colors and flavors of honey, depending upon its nectar\nsource. The bees make honey from the nectar they collect from\nflowering trees and plants. Honey is an easily digestible, pure\nfood. Honey is hydroscopic and has antibacterial qualities. Eating\nlocal honey can fend off allergies.\nBeeswax\nSecreted from glands, beeswax is used by the honeybee to build\nhoney comb. It is used by humans in drugs, cosmetics, artists'\nmaterials, furniture polish and candles.\nPropolis\nCollected by honeybees from trees, the sticky resin is mixed with\nwax to make a sticky glue. The bees use this to seal cracks and\nrepair their hive. It is used by humans as a health aid, and as\nthe basis for fine wood varnishes.\nRoyal\nJelly\n\nThe powerful, milky substance that turns an ordinary bee into\na Queen Bee. It is made of digested pollen and honey or nectar\nmixed with a chemical secreted from a gland in a nursing bee's\nhead. It commands premium prices rivaling imported caviar, and\nis used by some as a dietary supplement and fertility stimulant. It is loaded with all of the B vitamins.\nBee Venom\n\nThe \"ouch\" part of the honeybee. Although sharp pain\nand some swelling and itching are natural reactions to a honeybee\nsting, a small percentage of individuals are highly allergic\nto bee venom. \"Bee venom therapy\" is widely practiced\noverseas and by some in the USA to address health problems such\nas arthritis, neuralgia, high blood pressure, high cholesterol\nand even MS.\n\u00a0\nOTHER\nBITS OF INFORMATION\nHoneybees are not native to the USA. They\n  are European in origin, and were brought to North America by\n  the early settlers.\nHoneybees are not aggressive by nature, and\n  will not sting unless protecting their hive from an intruder\n  or are unduly provoked.\nHoneybees represent a highly organized society,\n  with various bees having very specific roles during their lifetime:\n  e.g., nurses, guards, grocers, housekeepers, construction workers,\n  royal attendants, undertakers, foragers, etc.\nThe queen bee can live for several years.\n  Worker bees live for 6 weeks during the busy summer, and for\n  4-9 months during the winter months.\nThe practice of honey collection and beekeeping\n  dates back to the stone-age, as evidenced by cave paintings.\nThe honeybee hive is perennial. Although\n  quite inactive during the winter, the honeybee survives the winter\n  months by clustering for warmth. By self-regulating the internal\n  temperature of the cluster, the bees maintain 93 degrees Fahrenheit\n  in the center of the winter cluster (regardless of the outside\n  temperature).\n\u00a0\n    THREE\n    CASTES OF HONEYBEE\n\nQueen Bee\n\n\n\n  There is only one queen per hive. The queen is the only bee with\n  fully developed ovaries. A queen bee can live for 3-5 years.\n  The queen mates only once with several male (drone) bees, and\n  will remain fertile for life. She lays up to 2000 eggs per day.\n  Fertilized eggs become female (worker bees) and unfertilized\n  eggs become male (drone bees). When she dies or becomes unproductive,\n  the other bees will \"make\" a new queen by selecting\n  a young larva and feeding it a diet of \"royal jelly\".\n  For queen bees, it takes 16 days from egg to emergence.\n\nWorker Bee\n\n\n\n  All worker bees are female, but they are not able to reproduce.\n  Worker bees live for 4-9 months during the winter season, but\n  only 6 weeks during the busy summer months (they literally work\n  themselves to death). Nearly all of the bees in a hive are worker\n  bees. A hive consists of 20,000 - 30,000 bees in the winter,\n  and over 60,000 - 80,000 bees in the summer. The worker bees\n  sequentially take on a series of specific chores during their\n  lifetime: housekeeper; nursemaid; construction worker; grocer;\n  undertaker; guard; and finally, after 21 days they become a forager\n  collecting pollen and nectar. For worker bees, it takes 21 days\n  from egg to emergence. The worker bee has a barbed stinger that\n  results in her death following stinging, therefore, she can only\n  sting once.\n\nDrone Bee\n\n\n  These male bees are kept on standby during the summer for mating\n  with a virgin queen. Because the drone has a barbed sex organ,\n  mating is followed by death of the drone. There are only 300-3000\n  drones in a hive. The drone does not have a stinger. Because they\n  are of no use in the winter, drones are expelled from the hive\n  in the autumn.\n\u00a0\n    THREATS\nTO BEEKEEPING\n\nMites\n\n  The greatest threat to beekeeping are two varieties of mites\n  (Varroa and Tracheal). And although these mites can be kept under\n  control by a persistent beekeeper, the negative effects on the\n  honeybee population has been devastating. The Back Yard Beekeepers\n  Association surveyed its membership and learned that over 40%\n  of the membership's hives died in 1996. These mites are greatly\n  reducing the overall honeybee population in the USA. The mites\n  are of no concern to humans, except for the effect they can have\n  on honey production.\n    \nDisease\n\n  Beekeepers are on the watch for various diseases unique to honeybees,\n  and harmless to humans. \"Foul Brood\" and \"Nosema\"\n  are two such diseases. These problems can easily be addressed\n  by good management and proper medication.\n    \nUrbanization\n\n\n\n  With more and more urban development and the growth of cities,\n  there is less and less foraging available to bees. However, areas\n  like Fairfield County contain a rich assortment of nectar and\n  pollen for honeybees, thanks to homeowners' gardens and the lush,\n  wooded countryside.\n\nAfricanized Bees\n\n  The arrival of so-called \"killer bees\" in a few southern states has\n    received sensationalized treatment in the media. In some areas of the country, this negative publicity\n  has stimulated local restrictions and ordinances on the hobbyist\n  beekeeper.\n\u00a0\n    ROYAL\nJELLY FACT SHEET\n\nRoyal Jelly is the substance that turns an\n  ordinary bee into the Queen Bee. It is made of pollen which is\n  chewed up and mixed with a chemical secreted from a gland in\n  the nursing bee's heads. This \"milk\" or \"pollen\n  mush\" is fed to all the larvae for the first two days of\n  their lives.\nThe larvae chosen to become a queen continue\n  to eat only royal jelly. The queen grows one and a half times\n  larger than the ordinary bee, and is capable of laying up to\n  two thousand eggs a day. The Queen Bee lives forty times longer\n  than the bees on a regular diet. There is no difference between\n  a queen bee and a worker bee in the larval stage. The only factor\n  that is different between them is that a developing queen bee\n  continues to eat only royal jelly.\nScientists decided to try feeding the queen\n  bee's diet to other animals with surprising results. The life\n  spa of pigs and roosters showed as much as a thirty- percent\n  increases. Fruit flies fed royal jelly increased in size and\n  in rate of production. Chickens given royal jelly laid twice\n  as many eggs, and older chickens began to lay again.\nIn France, there have been reports of women\n  fed royal jelly during menopause, showing complete remission\n  of their symptoms. Some were even able to become mothers again.\n  France also claimed that their studies showed royal jelly to\n  have rejuvenating and sexually stimulating effects on both men\n  and women. Canada has approved royal jelly as a natural dietary\n  supplement for its athletes. Royal jelly is not a drug, but a\n  nutritious, quickly assimilated food.\nIn Germany, Drs.\n    Chochi, Prosperi, Quadri\n  and Malossi (in separate studies) used royal jelly as an aid\n  to badly undernourished and premature babies. The infants fed\n  royal jelly increased in weight and health. Another doctor, Telatui,\n  reported that neuro-psychic patients given royal jelly regained\n  normal weight, a more stable nervous system, and a greater degree\n  of stamina for physical and mental work.\nChemical analysis of royal jelly found it\n  rich in protein and the B vitamins (especially panothenic acid).\n  However, analysis of royal jelly fails to break it down into\n  all its different components. It cannot be synthesized.\nRoyal jelly has proven to be a potent bactericide.\n  It also acts as a catalyst, stimulating intercellular metabolic\n  activities without significantly modifying normal physiological\n  activity. Thus, it hastens cell recovery with no side effects.\n  Royal jelly has been known to speed up healing of wounds and\n  to reduce the amount of scarring.\nThe beneficial effects of royal jelly seem\n  not to depend entirely upon its vitamin content, but upon some\n  type of enzymatic or catalytic action of an as yet unknown factor;\n  or perhaps, the known factors working in combination with a co-enzyme\n  through a process that has not yet been defined.\nSince the action of royal jelly seems to\n  be systemic rather that one which affects a specific biological\n  function, it has been recommended for a great variety of purposes:\n  to retard the aging process, for menopause, correction of under-nutrition,\n  for arthritis, vascular diseases, peptic ulcers, liver ailments,\n  nervous instability, skin problems, improvement of sexual functions,\n  general health and well being.\n\u00a0\n    GLOSSARY\nOF TERMS\n\nBeeswax:\n    \n waxy\n  material produced by worker bees and used to build combs.\n    \nDrones:\n Male\n  bees, whose main function in the colony is to fertilize the queen.\n  Drones make up a very small percentage of the total colony.

The queen is the only bee with\n  fully developed ovaries. A queen bee can live for 3-5 years.\n  The queen mates only once with several male (drone) bees, and\n  will remain fertile for life. She lays up to 2000 eggs per day.\n  Fertilized eggs become female (worker bees) and unfertilized\n  eggs become male (drone bees). When she dies or becomes unproductive,\n  the other bees will \"make\" a new queen by selecting\n  a young larva and feeding it a diet of \"royal jelly\".\n  For queen bees, it takes 16 days from egg to emergence.\n\nWorker Bee\n\n\n\n  All worker bees are female, but they are not able to reproduce.\n  Worker bees live for 4-9 months during the winter season, but\n  only 6 weeks during the busy summer months (they literally work\n  themselves to death). Nearly all of the bees in a hive are worker\n  bees. A hive consists of 20,000 - 30,000 bees in the winter,\n  and over 60,000 - 80,000 bees in the summer. The worker bees\n  sequentially take on a series of specific chores during their\n  lifetime: housekeeper; nursemaid; construction worker; grocer;\n  undertaker; guard; and finally, after 21 days they become a forager\n  collecting pollen and nectar. For worker bees, it takes 21 days\n  from egg to emergence. The worker bee has a barbed stinger that\n  results in her death following stinging, therefore, she can only\n  sting once.\n\nDrone Bee\n\n\n  These male bees are kept on standby during the summer for mating\n  with a virgin queen. Because the drone has a barbed sex organ,\n  mating is followed by death of the drone. There are only 300-3000\n  drones in a hive. The drone does not have a stinger. Because they\n  are of no use in the winter, drones are expelled from the hive\n  in the autumn.\n\u00a0\n    THREATS\nTO BEEKEEPING\n\nMites\n\n  The greatest threat to beekeeping are two varieties of mites\n  (Varroa and Tracheal). And although these mites can be kept under\n  control by a persistent beekeeper, the negative effects on the\n  honeybee population has been devastating. The Back Yard Beekeepers\n  Association surveyed its membership and learned that over 40%\n  of the membership's hives died in 1996. These mites are greatly\n  reducing the overall honeybee population in the USA. The mites\n  are of no concern to humans, except for the effect they can have\n  on honey production.\n    \nDisease\n\n  Beekeepers are on the watch for various diseases unique to honeybees,\n  and harmless to humans. \"Foul Brood\" and \"Nosema\"\n  are two such diseases. These problems can easily be addressed\n  by good management and proper medication.\n    \nUrbanization\n\n\n\n  With more and more urban development and the growth of cities,\n  there is less and less foraging available to bees. However, areas\n  like Fairfield County contain a rich assortment of nectar and\n  pollen for honeybees, thanks to homeowners' gardens and the lush,\n  wooded countryside.\n\nAfricanized Bees\n\n  The arrival of so-called \"killer bees\" in a few southern states has\n    received sensationalized treatment in the media. In some areas of the country, this negative publicity\n  has stimulated local restrictions and ordinances on the hobbyist\n  beekeeper.\n\u00a0\n    ROYAL\nJELLY FACT SHEET\n\nRoyal Jelly is the substance that turns an\n  ordinary bee into the Queen Bee. It is made of pollen which is\n  chewed up and mixed with a chemical secreted from a gland in\n  the nursing bee's heads. This \"milk\" or \"pollen\n  mush\" is fed to all the larvae for the first two days of\n  their lives.\nThe larvae chosen to become a queen continue\n  to eat only royal jelly. The queen grows one and a half times\n  larger than the ordinary bee, and is capable of laying up to\n  two thousand eggs a day. The Queen Bee lives forty times longer\n  than the bees on a regular diet. There is no difference between\n  a queen bee and a worker bee in the larval stage. The only factor\n  that is different between them is that a developing queen bee\n  continues to eat only royal jelly.\nScientists decided to try feeding the queen\n  bee's diet to other animals with surprising results. The life\n  spa of pigs and roosters showed as much as a thirty- percent\n  increases. Fruit flies fed royal jelly increased in size and\n  in rate of production. Chickens given royal jelly laid twice\n  as many eggs, and older chickens began to lay again.\nIn France, there have been reports of women\n  fed royal jelly during menopause, showing complete remission\n  of their symptoms. Some were even able to become mothers again.\n  France also claimed that their studies showed royal jelly to\n  have rejuvenating and sexually stimulating effects on both men\n  and women. Canada has approved royal jelly as a natural dietary\n  supplement for its athletes. Royal jelly is not a drug, but a\n  nutritious, quickly assimilated food.\nIn Germany, Drs.\n    Chochi, Prosperi, Quadri\n  and Malossi (in separate studies) used royal jelly as an aid\n  to badly undernourished and premature babies. The infants fed\n  royal jelly increased in weight and health. Another doctor, Telatui,\n  reported that neuro-psychic patients given royal jelly regained\n  normal weight, a more stable nervous system, and a greater degree\n  of stamina for physical and mental work.\nChemical analysis of royal jelly found it\n  rich in protein and the B vitamins (especially panothenic acid).\n  However, analysis of royal jelly fails to break it down into\n  all its different components. It cannot be synthesized.\nRoyal jelly has proven to be a potent bactericide.\n  It also acts as a catalyst, stimulating intercellular metabolic\n  activities without significantly modifying normal physiological\n  activity. Thus, it hastens cell recovery with no side effects.\n  Royal jelly has been known to speed up healing of wounds and\n  to reduce the amount of scarring.\nThe beneficial effects of royal jelly seem\n  not to depend entirely upon its vitamin content, but upon some\n  type of enzymatic or catalytic action of an as yet unknown factor;\n  or perhaps, the known factors working in combination with a co-enzyme\n  through a process that has not yet been defined.\nSince the action of royal jelly seems to\n  be systemic rather that one which affects a specific biological\n  function, it has been recommended for a great variety of purposes:\n  to retard the aging process, for menopause, correction of under-nutrition,\n  for arthritis, vascular diseases, peptic ulcers, liver ailments,\n  nervous instability, skin problems, improvement of sexual functions,\n  general health and well being.\n\u00a0\n    GLOSSARY\nOF TERMS\n\nBeeswax:\n    \n waxy\n  material produced by worker bees and used to build combs.\n    \nDrones:\n Male\n  bees, whose main function in the colony is to fertilize the queen.\n  Drones make up a very small percentage of the total colony.

The queen is the only bee with\n  fully developed ovaries. A queen bee can live for 3-5 years.\n  The queen mates only once with several male (drone) bees, and\n  will remain fertile for life. She lays up to 2000 eggs per day.\n  Fertilized eggs become female (worker bees) and unfertilized\n  eggs become male (drone bees). When she dies or becomes unproductive,\n  the other bees will \"make\" a new queen by selecting\n  a young larva and feeding it a diet of \"royal jelly\".\n  For queen bees, it takes 16 days from egg to emergence.\n\nWorker Bee\n\n\n\n  All worker bees are female, but they are not able to reproduce.\n  Worker bees live for 4-9 months during the winter season, but\n  only 6 weeks during the busy summer months (they literally work\n  themselves to death). Nearly all of the bees in a hive are worker\n  bees. A hive consists of 20,000 - 30,000 bees in the winter,\n  and over 60,000 - 80,000 bees in the summer. The worker bees\n  sequentially take on a series of specific chores during their\n  lifetime: housekeeper; nursemaid; construction worker; grocer;\n  undertaker; guard; and finally, after 21 days they become a forager\n  collecting pollen and nectar. For worker bees, it takes 21 days\n  from egg to emergence. The worker bee has a barbed stinger that\n  results in her death following stinging, therefore, she can only\n  sting once.\n\nDrone Bee\n\n\n  These male bees are kept on standby during the summer for mating\n  with a virgin queen. Because the drone has a barbed sex organ,\n  mating is followed by death of the drone. There are only 300-3000\n  drones in a hive. The drone does not have a stinger. Because they\n  are of no use in the winter, drones are expelled from the hive\n  in the autumn.\n\u00a0\n    THREATS\nTO BEEKEEPING\n\nMites\n\n  The greatest threat to beekeeping are two varieties of mites\n  (Varroa and Tracheal). And although these mites can be kept under\n  control by a persistent beekeeper, the negative effects on the\n  honeybee population has been devastating. The Back Yard Beekeepers\n  Association surveyed its membership and learned that over 40%\n  of the membership's hives died in 1996. These mites are greatly\n  reducing the overall honeybee population in the USA. The mites\n  are of no concern to humans, except for the effect they can have\n  on honey production.\n    \nDisease\n\n  Beekeepers are on the watch for various diseases unique to honeybees,\n  and harmless to humans. \"Foul Brood\" and \"Nosema\"\n  are two such diseases. These problems can easily be addressed\n  by good management and proper medication.\n    \nUrbanization\n\n\n\n  With more and more urban development and the growth of cities,\n  there is less and less foraging available to bees. However, areas\n  like Fairfield County contain a rich assortment of nectar and\n  pollen for honeybees, thanks to homeowners' gardens and the lush,\n  wooded countryside.\n\nAfricanized Bees\n\n  The arrival of so-called \"killer bees\" in a few southern states has\n    received sensationalized treatment in the media. In some areas of the country, this negative publicity\n  has stimulated local restrictions and ordinances on the hobbyist\n  beekeeper.\n\u00a0\n    ROYAL\nJELLY FACT SHEET\n\nRoyal Jelly is the substance that turns an\n  ordinary bee into the Queen Bee. It is made of pollen which is\n  chewed up and mixed with a chemical secreted from a gland in\n  the nursing bee's heads. This \"milk\" or \"pollen\n  mush\" is fed to all the larvae for the first two days of\n  their lives.\nThe larvae chosen to become a queen continue\n  to eat only royal jelly. The queen grows one and a half times\n  larger than the ordinary bee, and is capable of laying up to\n  two thousand eggs a day. The Queen Bee lives forty times longer\n  than the bees on a regular diet. There is no difference between\n  a queen bee and a worker bee in the larval stage. The only factor\n  that is different between them is that a developing queen bee\n  continues to eat only royal jelly.\nScientists decided to try feeding the queen\n  bee's diet to other animals with surprising results. The life\n  spa of pigs and roosters showed as much as a thirty- percent\n  increases. Fruit flies fed royal jelly increased in size and\n  in rate of production. Chickens given royal jelly laid twice\n  as many eggs, and older chickens began to lay again.\nIn France, there have been reports of women\n  fed royal jelly during menopause, showing complete remission\n  of their symptoms. Some were even able to become mothers again.\n  France also claimed that their studies showed royal jelly to\n  have rejuvenating and sexually stimulating effects on both men\n  and women. Canada has approved royal jelly as a natural dietary\n  supplement for its athletes. Royal jelly is not a drug, but a\n  nutritious, quickly assimilated food.\nIn Germany, Drs.\n    Chochi, Prosperi, Quadri\n  and Malossi (in separate studies) used royal jelly as an aid\n  to badly undernourished and premature babies. The infants fed\n  royal jelly increased in weight and health.

A color code exists within the beekeeping industry to indicate the year the queen was introduced.\n\nWorker Bee\n\n\n\n  All worker bees are female, but they are not able to reproduce.\n  Worker bees live for 4-9 months during the winter season, but\n  only 6 weeks during the busy summer months (they literally work\n  themselves to death). Nearly all of the bees in a hive are worker\n  bees. A hive consists of 20,000 - 30,000 bees in the winter,\n  and over 60,000 - 80,000 bees in the summer. The worker bees\n  sequentially take on a series of specific chores during their\n  lifetime: housekeeper; nursemaid; construction worker; grocer;\n  undertaker; guard; and finally, after 21 days they become a forager\n  collecting pollen and nectar. For worker bees, it takes 21 days\n  from egg to emergence. The worker bee has a barbed stinger that\n  results in her death following stinging, therefore, she can only\n  sting once.\n\nDrone Bee\n\n\n  These male bees are kept on standby during the summer for mating\n  with a virgin queen. Because the drone has a barbed sex organ,\n  mating is followed by death of the drone. There are only 300-3000\n  drones in a hive. The drone does not have a stinger. Because they\n  are of no use in the winter, drones are expelled from the hive\n  in the autumn.\n\u00a0\n    THREATS\nTO BEEKEEPING\n\nMites\n\n  The greatest threat to beekeeping are two varieties of mites\n  (Varroa and Tracheal). And although these mites can be kept under\n  control by a persistent beekeeper, the negative effects on the\n  honeybee population has been devastating. The Back Yard Beekeepers\n  Association surveyed its membership and learned that over 40%\n  of the membership's hives died in 1996. These mites are greatly\n  reducing the overall honeybee population in the USA. The mites\n  are of no concern to humans, except for the effect they can have\n  on honey production.\n    \nDisease\n\n  Beekeepers are on the watch for various diseases unique to honeybees,\n  and harmless to humans. \"Foul Brood\" and \"Nosema\"\n  are two such diseases. These problems can easily be addressed\n  by good management and proper medication.\n    \nUrbanization\n\n\n\n  With more and more urban development and the growth of cities,\n  there is less and less foraging available to bees. However, areas\n  like Fairfield County contain a rich assortment of nectar and\n  pollen for honeybees, thanks to homeowners' gardens and the lush,\n  wooded countryside.\n\nAfricanized Bees\n\n  The arrival of so-called \"killer bees\" in a few southern states has\n    received sensationalized treatment in the media. In some areas of the country, this negative publicity\n  has stimulated local restrictions and ordinances on the hobbyist\n  beekeeper.\n\u00a0\n    ROYAL\nJELLY FACT SHEET\n\nRoyal Jelly is the substance that turns an\n  ordinary bee into the Queen Bee. It is made of pollen which is\n  chewed up and mixed with a chemical secreted from a gland in\n  the nursing bee's heads. This \"milk\" or \"pollen\n  mush\" is fed to all the larvae for the first two days of\n  their lives.\nThe larvae chosen to become a queen continue\n  to eat only royal jelly. The queen grows one and a half times\n  larger than the ordinary bee, and is capable of laying up to\n  two thousand eggs a day. The Queen Bee lives forty times longer\n  than the bees on a regular diet. There is no difference between\n  a queen bee and a worker bee in the larval stage. The only factor\n  that is different between them is that a developing queen bee\n  continues to eat only royal jelly.\nScientists decided to try feeding the queen\n  bee's diet to other animals with surprising results. The life\n  spa of pigs and roosters showed as much as a thirty- percent\n  increases. Fruit flies fed royal jelly increased in size and\n  in rate of production. Chickens given royal jelly laid twice\n  as many eggs, and older chickens began to lay again.\nIn France, there have been reports of women\n  fed royal jelly during menopause, showing complete remission\n  of their symptoms. Some were even able to become mothers again.\n  France also claimed that their studies showed royal jelly to\n  have rejuvenating and sexually stimulating effects on both men\n  and women. Canada has approved royal jelly as a natural dietary\n  supplement for its athletes. Royal jelly is not a drug, but a\n  nutritious, quickly assimilated food.\nIn Germany, Drs.\n    Chochi, Prosperi, Quadri\n  and Malossi (in separate studies) used royal jelly as an aid\n  to badly undernourished and premature babies.

The \nidentifying mark should be small, so that it does not cover any other part of \nthe queen. A 1/16\" stick, lightly dipped in paint, is a good applicator. \nGenerally, queens are marked before being introduced, but they can; however, be \nmarked at any time. Paint should be given ample time to dry before the queen is \nreleased into the colony. In fact, queens may be purchased already marked by the \nqueen producer.\n\n\nSome beekeepers also identify queens by clipping the tip of the tip of one\nforewing. If queens are replaced every two years, the beekeeper clips the left\nwing(s) on queens introduced in odd years, and the right on queens introduced in\neven years. The clipping practice may also supplement the paint spot technique\nas a\u00a0 back-up should the queen lose her paint mark. If clipped correctly,\nthe queen will not be able to fly. However, if clipped too closely, the queen\nmay appear damaged and be superseded.\n\n"], ["Honeybee - National Geographic", "http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/bugs/honeybee/", "Skip to this page's content\nApis mellifera\nWorker honeybees are all females and are the only bees most people ever see. They forage for food and build and protect the hive, among many other societal functions.\nPhotograph by Stephen Buchman\nHoneybee  Range\nHoneybee hives have long provided humans with honey and beeswax. Such commercial uses have spawned a large beekeeping industry, though many species still occur in the wild.\nAll honeybees are social and cooperative insects. A hive's inhabitants are generally divided into three types.\nWorkers are the only bees that most people ever see. These bees are females that are not sexually developed. Workers forage for food (pollen and nectar from flowers), build and protect the hive, clean, circulate air by beating their wings, and perform many other societal functions.\nThe queen's job is simple\u2014laying the eggs that will spawn the hive's next generation of bees. There is usually only a single queen in a hive. If the queen dies, workers will create a new queen by feeding one of the worker females a special diet of a food called \"royal jelly.\" This elixir enables the worker to develop into a fertile queen. Queens also regulate the hive's activities by producing chemicals that guide the behavior of the other bees.\nMale bees are called drones\u2014the third class of honeybee. Several hundred drones live in each hive during the spring and summer, but they are expelled for the winter months when the hive goes into a lean survival mode.\nBees live on stored honey and pollen all winter, and cluster into a ball to conserve warmth. Larvae are fed from the stores during this season and, by spring, the hive is swarming with a new generation of bees.\n\n\n\nEmail\nMore \u00bb\nWorld's Weirdest: Biggest Spider\nSpiders Pounce Better in Green Light\n3.

When she gets back to the\nhive, she passes the nectar on to another worker. This worker holds\nthe nectar on her tongue until the water evaporates (leaves the\nnectar to go back into the air). She is left with honey on her\ntongue, which is stored in the hive.\nBees eat their store of honey in\nthe winter, when there is no food.\nWhen a bee finds a good place with\nlots of flowers, she marks the spot with a scent. She then goes back\nto the hive and does a little \"dance\" which tells the other bees the\ndistance and direction to go. This communication helps the hive\nlocate good places so they don't waste time always looking for\nflowers.\nHoney Bees are attracted to\nflowers with bright colors, but they cannot see red. Plants, which\nhave bright flowers so that insects will pollinate\nthem, have to rely on some other animal (like a butterfly or\nhummingbird) if they have red flowers.\nWhen a bee enters a flower, it has\nto go deep down to get to the nectar. While it drinks nectar, the bee\ngets covered with pollen. The bee also collects the pollen in its\npollen basket (part of its hind legs). When the bee moves on to\nanother flower, some of the pollen from the first flower rubs off on\nthe second flower. This is pollination. Now the plant will drop its\nflower and make a fruit with seeds in it. The seeds may grow into a\nnew plant. The bees cannot live without the plants and the plants\ncannot live without the bees.\nWorker bees have a stinger which\nis sharp and has a barb on it (like a fishhook). The stinger is\nattached to a venom\ngland in the abdomen. Honey Bees only sting if they, or the hive, are\nin danger. If a Honey Bee stings a wasp, because the wasp has soft\ntissue, the bee can pull her stinger out and sting again. However, if\nshe stings an animal with tougher tissue, such as a frog or a human,\nthe barb gets caught and the stinger tears out of the abdomen, along\nwith the poison gland. This will kill the Honey Bee.\nThe venom is what makes the\nbeesting hurt. A muscle attached to the venom gland continues to pump\npoison into the wound, even after the bee is gone. Beestings, are not\nreally dangerous unless you are allergic\nto bees!\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHoney Bees will usually\n         leave people alone, but they are attracted to some soaps,\n         perfumes, and hair sprays. If one comes near you, it is\n         probably confused. Once it realizes you have no nectar, it\n         will leave you alone. \nMany predators\n         avoid Honey Bees because of their sting, but others eat\n         them.\nThe worst predator for\n         Honey Bees is the Varroa Mite. Varroa Mites are tiny\n         arachnids\n         (spider cousins). Varroa Mites weaken the Honey Bee's immune\n         system, which makes them vulnerable to diseases.

Gustafson\r\n        (see links below)\nThe comb is two-sided, with cells on both sides.\u00a0 As you can see, the cells\r\n        are perfectly uniform in shape.\u00a0 Not only that, but the combs are built a precise\r\n        distance apart depending on whether they are meant to contain food or young bees.\u00a0\r\n        The nursery area of the hive is called the brood comb,\r\n        and that is where the queen lays her eggs.\nFlower nectar is one of two food sources used by honeybees.\u00a0 The other is\r\n    pollen.\u00a0 Both are gathered by the field bees as they fly about on their daily\r\n    foraging flights.\u00a0 \n\nHoneybees are important pollinators\nThe\r\n        field bees stop periodically to groom themselves and collect the pollen onto their pollen\r\n        baskets. \u00a0 They remove this load from their legs when they return to the hive and the\r\n        house bees store it in a special part of the comb.\u00a0 The pollen provides protein and\r\n        other essential nutrients for the bees.\u00a0\n\r\n        Photo by P.O Gustafson\r\n        (see links below)\n\nThere are four different species of honeybee in the\r\n    world:\nCave paintings in Europe indicate that early peoples were harvesting honey 8,000 years\r\n    ago.\u00a0 The next step in human/honeybee relations came when people started keeping bees\r\n    in man-made structures rather than just going out and searching for wild hives.\u00a0 The\r\n    ancient Egyptians were beekeepers and their methods were copied throughout the\r\n    Mediterranean and Middle East.\u00a0 They used the Western Honeybee, and that is the most\r\n    widely used species today.\u00a0 The Eastern Honeybee was also domesticated long ago in\r\n    China.\u00a0 The other two species of honeybee do not nest in cavities and so were not\r\n    suited to being put into hives.\u00a0 The subject of beekeeping is beyond the scope of\r\n    this web page.\u00a0 For more information, see the links below.\n\nTop of page\nWhat are\r\n    \"Killer\" Bees?\nMore properly called Africanized Honeybees, these come from a subspecies of honeybee (Apis\r\n    mellifera scutellata) released accidentally in Brazil in 1957.\u00a0 They were\r\n    imported from South Africa by a researcher who was attempting to produce a variety of\r\n    honeybee better adapted to the tropics than the European Honeybee.\u00a0 Unfortunately,\r\n    Africanized Honeybees not only produce honey better in hot climates, but they are also\r\n    much more aggressive at defending the nest.\u00a0 Many people have been killed by mass\r\n    stinging resulting from getting too close to a nest of Africanized honeybees. \u00a0 The\r\n    escaped bees did well in the wild and began reproducing and expanding their range across\r\n    South America into Central America and Mexico.\u00a0 They were recorded in Texas in\r\n    October 1990, California in November 1994 and Oklahoma in 2004.\u00a0 Since they are\r\n    adapted for tropical conditions, they may not expand their range beyond the southern part\r\n    of the U.S., but that remains to be seen.\u00a0 They can tolerate up to 3 1/2 months of\r\n    freezing weather.\nDistribution of\r\n    Africanized Honeybees in the U.S.\r\n    1990-2011.\n\nGraphic from the Carl Hayden Bee Research Center.\r\n    Visit their web site\r\n

causes them to leave the hive and not return, leading ultimately\r\n    to death of the colony.\u00a0 First noticed in late 2006 in North America, CCD has been\r\n    the focus of much research to try to determine what is causing it.\u00a0 Pathogens,\r\n    parasites, environmental toxins and even cell phone transmissions have been the subject of\r\n    investigation.\u00a0 As of this writing (November 2007) the one factor that has been\r\n    identified as being uniquely associated with CCD is a virus known as Israeli Acute\r\n    Paralysis Virus (IAPV).\u00a0 It is not proven yet that IAPV is the sole cause of CCD, but\r\n    it is found in nearly all hives affected by CCD.\u00a0 A possible scenario is that CCD is\r\n    triggered by various stress factors in bees infected with IAPV.\u00a0 Research is\r\n    currently underway to test this hypothesis.\nFor more information on CCD, see the Mid-Atlantic Apiculture Research and Extension\r\n    Consortium

25 mm.\u00a0 There are 130 species in North America.\u00a0 Both\r\n    leafcutters and mason bees (see below) are superior pollinators compared to\r\n    honeybees.\u00a0 One leafcutter bee will do the same amount of pollination as 20\r\n    honeybees!\u00a0 To learn more, read what the USDA Agricultural Research Service has to\r\n    say about the Alfalfa Leafcutter\r\n    Bee.\n\nMason Bees!\r\n    Mason bees (Osmia sp.) typically use the abandoned tunnels of wood-boring beetles\r\n    for their nest.\u00a0 These small bees are not social.\u00a0 Mason bees mate immediately\r\n    after hatching in the spring.\u00a0 The female then searches for an appropriate hole or\r\n    crevice to build her nest.\u00a0 After preparing a brood chamber, she gathers pollen and\r\n    nectar until she has enough to feed a larva to adulthood.\u00a0 Then she lays an egg and\r\n    closes the chamber with mud.\u00a0 She repeats the process until the tunnel is completely\r\n    filled and caps the tunnel with an extra-thick plug of mud.\u00a0 She will repeat this\r\n    process until she dies in early summer. \u00a0 The mature larvae pupate and overwinter in\r\n    their nursery cells.\u00a0 Mason bees are closely related to the Leaf-cutting bees.\u00a0\r\n    To gather pollen, they both use a brush of hairs on the underside of the abdomen (called a\r\n    scopa) instead of pollen baskets\r\n    on their legs. \u00a0 There are 140 species in North America.\u00a0 You can find out more\r\n    about Mason Bees from the Washington State Extension\r\n    service.\u00a0 Learn how to make a nesting block for them from the North Carolina\r\n    Extension service.\nTop of page\n\n<!--\r\nMSFPhover = \r\n  (((navigator.appName == \"Netscape\") && \r\n  (parseInt(navigator.appVersion) >= 3 )) || \r\n  ((navigator.appName == \"Microsoft Internet Explorer\") && \r\n  (parseInt(navigator.appVersion) >= 4 ))); \r\nfunction MSFPpreload(img) \r\n{\r\n  var a=new Image(); a.src=img; return a; \r\n}\r\n// --><!--\r\nif(MSFPhover) { MSFPnav1n=MSFPpreload('_derived/up_cmp_gpnc110_hbtn.gif'); MSFPnav1h=MSFPpreload('_derived/up_cmp_gpnc110_hbtn_a.gif'); }\r\n// --> <!--\r\nif(MSFPhover) { MSFPnav2n=MSFPpreload('_derived/cwoodborer.htm_cmp_gpnc110_hbtn.gif'); MSFPnav2h=MSFPpreload('_derived/cwoodborer.htm_cmp_gpnc110_hbtn_a.gif'); }\r\n// --> <!--\r\nif(MSFPhover) { MSFPnav3n=MSFPpreload('_derived/cicadas.htm_cmp_gpnc110_hbtn.gif'); MSFPnav3h=MSFPpreload('_derived/cicadas.htm_cmp_gpnc110_hbtn_a.gif'); }\r\n// --> <!--\r\nif(MSFPhover) { MSFPnav4n=MSFPpreload('_derived/field1.htm_cmp_gpnc110_hbtn.gif'); MSFPnav4h=MSFPpreload('_derived/field1.htm_cmp_gpnc110_hbtn_a.gif'); }\r\n// -->  <!--\r\nif(MSFPhover) { MSFPnav5n=MSFPpreload('_derived/odonata.htm_cmp_gpnc110_hbtn.gif'); MSFPnav5h=MSFPpreload('_derived/odonata.htm_cmp_gpnc110_hbtn_a.gif'); }\r\n// --> <!--\r\nif(MSFPhover) { MSFPnav6n=MSFPpreload('_derived/butterflies.htm_cmp_gpnc110_hbtn.gif'); MSFPnav6h=MSFPpreload('_derived/butterflies.htm_cmp_gpnc110_hbtn_a.gif'); }\r\n// -->\n- This page was spun\r\n    by Jim Mason -

A more detailed final report is being prepared for publication at a later date.\nThe Bee Informed Partnership (http://beeinformed.org), in collaboration with the Apiary Inspectors of America (AIA) and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), is releasing preliminary results for the eighth annual national survey of honey bee colony losses. For the 2013/2014 winter season, 7,183 beekeepers in the United States (U.S.) responded. Collectively, they managed 564,522 colonies in October 2013, 21.7%\u00a0 of the country\u2019s 2.6 million colonies.\nFor the winter of 2013/14, 23.2% of managed honey bee colonies in the U.S. died. Nearly two-thirds of the respondents (65.4%) experienced winter colony loss rates greater than the average self-reported acceptable winter mortality rate of 18.9%. The 2013/14 winter colony loss rate of 23.2% is 7.3 points (or 23.9%) lower than the previous years\u2019 (2012/13) estimate of 30.5% loss. (Figure 1) and is notably lower than the 8-year average total loss of 29.6% .\nPreliminary results for the 2013/14 survey indicate that 20.0% of all colonies managed between April 1 2013 and Oct 1 2013 died.\u00a0\u00a0 Responding beekeepers who managed bees over the entire April 2013 \u2013 April 2014 survey period reported losing 34.2% of the 670,568 colonies managed over this period.\u00a0 The annual loss differs from the sum of summer and winter losses reported above because the respondent pool differed as only respondents who reported for both the summer and winter period are included in the annual loss rate calculation.\nThe 2012/13 survey expanded beyond only winter mortality estimates to improve our understanding of colony losses by also reporting on summer and annual colony mortality rates. Results from the 2012/13 survey indicated that that summer colony losses (between April 1 2012 and Oct 1 2012) were 25.3%.\u00a0\u00a0 Loss estimate for the 12-month period (between April 1, 2012 and March 30, 2013) was 45.2%.\nThis survey was conducted by the Bee Informed Partnership, which receives a majority of its funding from the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, USDA (award number: 2011-67007-20017).\n1.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0University of Maryland, dennis.vanengelsdorp@gmail.com, 717-884-2147\n2.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0University of Tennessee\n3.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0University of Illinois\n4.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Oregon State University\n5.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0University of Georgia\n6.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0University of Florida\n7.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0University of Minnesota\n8.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The Pennsylvania State University \u2013 Hershey\n9.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0USDA-ARS Bee Research Lab\n10.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service\n11.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0North Carolina State University\n12.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Appalachian State University\n*Corresponding author\n1.

The Bee Informed Partnership is an extension project that endeavors to decrease the number of honey bee colonies that die over the winter. A listing of all project activity reports can be found at the 'Results' tab above. Results published in scientific journals are included as links. Who's on the team? See the Team Pages.\nIt would be helpful to see a state-by-state or at least a regional breakdown of the data. Obviously, hives in the southwestern US this past winter were exposed to dramatically different conditions than here in Connecticut, where I am a suburban gardener. \nI have yet to see a honeybee in my garden this year, and have been fortunate that queen bumblebees are present and have been busy as bees.\nOne more thought: what do we know about residential uses of neonicotinoids like Imidicloprid in lawn and garden products? Garden centers, Home Depots and Lowes in this area push these products hard.\nD.B.\nHi Don,\nThe estimated date to have the state and regional breakdown is around the end of May beginning of June. \nFor the insecticides question I consulted with Nathalie who gave me a link here to this publication that may help answer some of the questions you may have.  This article has some good information in it, but there is still a lot that we do not know.  In general, residential users of insecticides can often apply quantities that are too high for their own good.  However, if it comes to a point where the use of an insecticide is necessary there are strategies you can use that are less harmful to pollinators.  When applying an insecticide it should be done during the night when pollinators are least active and you should avoid spraying on flowering plants.\nGarden centers and big box stores do not carry enough inventory of neonics to treat even 1% of the pollinator attractive plants in residential neighborhoods, hence the issue of impact on pollinators is moot.\nHave looked for the number of respondents to survey and\nHave looked for the raw data, but have been unable to find.\nMany bee keepers are giving up.\nHi Peter,\nRight now this is the preliminary report and we have not yet released the full report which will contain more detailed information.  Is there any specific information that you are looking for?\nHi!\nI understand these are preliminary results \u2013 do you have a sense for how close the final results will be (could it be by more than 1-2%)?\nWe have a question on our online forecasting platform SciCast.org where our members have been predicting what the colony loss would be for 2013/2014. One of the options they could pick was \u201cBetween 21% and 25%\u201d. Do you think it\u2019s safe to assume the final results will be within that range?\nThanks!\nHi Roland,\nThanks for the interest.  For the Colony Loss numbers we do not expect them to change significantly if at all and we would say it is safe to assume the final numbers will be within that range.  The main difference between the preliminary and final results will be that the final results will offer greater detail.\nPingback: If The Bees Die, We Will Follow \u00bb If The Bees Die, We Will Follow | GeoengineeringWatch.org\nPingback: Did Scientists Just Solve The Bee Collapse Mystery? | The Global Realm\nPingback: Governo norte-americano reconhece que abelhas est\u00e3o morrendo a uma taxa alarmante \u00bb IDEIA - Instituto de Defesa, Estudo e Integra\u00e7\u00e3o Ambiental\nPingback: Honeybee Winter Die-off \u201cToo High for Long-term Survival\u201d \u2013 USDA Report\nPingback: Bustle and Bother, part 2 | Purgatory Creek\nPingback: If The Bees Die, We Will Follow | Inside the Washington Beltway\nPingback: Did Scientists Just Solve the Bee Collapse Mystery? | digger666\nPingback: Beekeepers report honey bee losses down, but problem remains | Michigan News\nPingback: Bayer & Monsanto Killing Bees at Wise Living Journal\nPingback: Honey Bee Colony Loss Report for Winter 2013/2014 | Food Poisoning Bulletin\nPingback: Honey bee question has resolved | The Official SciCast Blog\nPingback: Colony Loss Report 2013-2014 | Friends of Honeybees\nPingback: Colony Loss 2013-2014 \u2013 Bee Informed Partnership | Dea Della Cucina\nPingback: Report: Honeybee Death Rate is Currently too High for Survival of the Species\nPingback: Honeybee Death Rate is Currently too High for Survival of the Species | Information Society\nPingback: Bee Informed: Colony Losses 2013-14 | Friends of Honeybees\nPingback: ReadMyFeed | Honeybee Death Rate is Currently too High for Survival of the Species\nPingback: foerstel : creative + results \u00bb bee free honee\nPingback: Report: Honeybee Death Rate is Currently too High for Survival of the Species | The Liberty Beacon\nPingback: Report: Honeybee Death Rate is Currently too High for Survival of the Species |\nSo, basically, our government is indirectly killing the bees thanks to their monopolistic promising of protection of corporations like Monsanto.

I said \u201cone of the theories for the decline of bees caused by all the microwaves from cell phone tower,  the bees leave their hive and become disoriented due to the overload in the atmosphere.

The European Union (EU) has announced that it will ban, for two years, the use of neonicotinoids, the much-maligned pesticide group often fingered in honeybee declines. The U.S. hasn't followed suit, though this year a group of\u00a0beekeepers and environmental and consumer groups sued the EPA for not doing enough to protect bees from the pesticide onslaught.\nFor the last several years scientists have fretted over the future of bees, and although research has shed much light on the crisis, those in the bee business\u2014from hive keepers to commercial farmers\u2014say the insects remain in deep trouble as their colonies continue to struggle.\nThe current crisis arose during the fall of 2006 as beekeepers around the country reported massive losses\u2014more than a third of hives on average and up to 90 percent in some cases. Bees were flying away and simply not coming back; keepers would find boxes empty of adult bees except for a live queen. No bee corpses remained to tell the tale. The losses were unprecedented and fast.\nNow it's five years later, and though colony collapse disorder (CCD)\u2014the name given to the mysterious killer condition\u2014has dwindled in the manner of cyclical diseases, bees are still battling for their lives and their colonies are weaker than ever. The latest data, from the 2012-2013 winter, indicate an average loss of 45.1 percent of hives across all U.S. beekeepers, up 78.2 percent from the previous winter, and a total loss of 31.1 percent of commercial hives, on par with the last six years. (Most keepers now consider a 15 percent loss \"acceptable.\")\nUnprecedented Pollinator Crisis\nWhy keep worrying over the fate of a bunch of pesky stinging insects? Bees in their crucial role as pollinators are paramount. Western nations rely heavily on managed honeybees\u2014the \"moveable force\" of bees that ride in trucks from farm to farm\u2014to keep commercial agriculture productive. About a third of our foods (some 100 key crops) rely on these insects, including apples, nuts, all the favorite summer fruits (like blueberries and strawberries), alfalfa (which cows eat), and guar bean (used in all kinds of products). In total, bees contribute more than $15 billion to U.S. crop production, hardly small potatoes.\nNo, we wouldn't starve without their services\u2014much of the world lives without managed pollinators. But we'd lose an awful lot of good, healthy food, from cherries and broccoli to onions and almonds. Or we'd pay exorbitant costs for farmers to use some other, less efficient pollination technique to supplement the work that healthy natural pollinators could do. Plus, bee health can tell us a lot about environmental health, and thus about our own well-being.\n\u00a0\nPhotograph by Tim Laman, National Geographic\n\u00a0\nToday's pollinator crisis, which has also hit Europe and now parts of Asia, is unprecedented. But honeybees have done disappearing acts on and off for more than a century, possibly since humans began domesticating them 4,500 years ago in Egypt. In the United States, unexplained colony declines in the 1880s, the 1920s, and the 1960s baffled farmers, and in 1995-1996 Pennsylvania keepers lost more than half of their colonies without a clear cause. The 1980s and 1990s saw various new parasites that hit bees hard; Varroa and tracheal mites became major killers, and they continue to plague hives and keep beekeepers up at night.\nWhen CCD appeared, the USDA's Agricultural Research Service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture joined forces to study and fight the assailant, but a half-dozen years later they still lack a smoking gun. Recent work reveals higher loads of pathogens in the guts of bees from collapsed colonies versus healthy ones\u2014making viral infections a likely culprit.\nBut this isn't a case of one cause, one effect. Bee expert Dennis vanEngelsdorp of the University of Maryland likens the situation to HIV/AIDS in humans. \"You don't die of AIDS; you die of pneumonia or some other condition that hits when your immunity is down,\" he says. Today's bee mortalities may be behaving slightly differently. \"But we're pretty sure in all these cases, diseases are the tipping point\" after bees' immune systems are compromised.\nSo what makes bees vulnerable to those diseases, what's killing their immunity, continues to be the $15-billion question.\nProblems Piling Up\nZac Browning is a fourth-generation beekeeper based in North Dakota. His mostly migratory commercial operation runs about 22,000 hives in three states\u2014meaning he trucks his bees to different locations at different times of year, renting out their pollination services to big farms like those producing almonds in California and canola in Idaho.\nCCD devastated his hives a few years back, but \"we've seen losses more recently from everything imaginable,\" he says. \"Pests, parasites, pesticide exposure, starvation, queen failures, you name it.\"\nIn addition to these problems piling up, \"our inputs have gone up one-and-a-half times in the last decade,\" he says. \"We now have to try to sustain bees [with extra food] when natural food is scarce, dearth periods that didn't exist before.\"\nPart of the problem is keepers have to boost hive numbers to meet demand, \"but the carrying capacity of the environment hasn't changed.\" In fact, it's gone down. The amount of undeveloped land with good bee forage just isn't enough to sustain the masses, he says.\nMeanwhile, studies have shown that colonies with access to the best pollens (with more than 25 percent protein plus essential amino acids), which occur in diverse plant habitats once common across the landscape, are more robust and more resistant to disease than those in pollen-poor environments.\nThe Threat From Pesticides\nAnother adversary in the bees' battle, as the EU reminds us, is pesticides. Pesticides themselves aren't necessarily a death sentence for bees\u2014and debate rages over whether, when properly applied, these chemicals can be used safely among pollinators. But exposure to them seems to open the door to other killers.\nFor example, bees exposed to sublethal doses of neonicotinoids\u2014the type the EU is banning and that are used routinely in the U.S. on wheat, corn, soy, and cotton crops\u2014become more easily infected by the gut parasite Nosema.\nMeanwhile, last year a French study indicated that this same class of chemicals can fog honeybee brains and alter behavior. And a British study on bumblebees, a natural pollinator in decline in many places, reported neonicotinoids keep bees from supplying their hives with enough food for queen production.\n\u00a0\nPhotograph by Marcio Jose Sanchez, AP\n\u00a0\n\"Honeybees are complex,\" says Browning. \"If you reduce their lives by even just a few days, the colony itself never thrives, never reaches its maximum potential. Sublethal effects that don't kill adults outright may still render hives weak and lethargic. And those hives might not survive the winter.\"\nWhat takes down the individual bee doesn't necessarily wipe out the colony, vanEngelsdorp explains. And pesticides, like other factors, do their worst when combined with other chemicals or stressors, not necessarily all by themselves. \"It's synergism,\" he says. \"One plus one may equal 10 with the right two products or insults together.\" (Samples of bee-collected pollen typically contain residue from numerous pesticides.) In the end, then, an immune-suppressed colony faces a downward spiral, unable to cope with stressors that weren't a problem during healthier years.\nThe chemicals of modern agriculture have long been vilified, and they certainly represent a vital and active line of inquiry: The number registered for use in the U.S. exceeds 1,200 active ingredients distributed among some 18,000 products, and state pesticide use records are mostly unavailable, leaving a lot of question marks. No one knows much about how low-level exposure to various chemicals over time or how various combinations affect the insects. Meanwhile, migratory colonies likely have very different chemical exposure than those who stay put. The landscape is messy.\nA New Concern\nIn newly worrisome findings, a study from a team at Penn State has revealed that \"inert\" ingredients (adjuvants) used regularly to boost the effectiveness of pesticides do as much or more harm than the active \"toxic\" ingredients. In one study adjuvants were shown to impair adult bees' smelling and navigation abilities, and in a separate study they killed bee larvae outright.\nThe formulas for these other ingredients \"are often proprietary information and not disclosed by the companies,\" says Penn State's Maryann Frazier, who wasn't an author on the study, \"so they cannot be independently tested and assessed for toxicity. When [the] EPA screens pesticides for registration, they only consider the active ingredient,\" she says.\nIn addition, \"there are no requirements by [the] EPA for companies to test the impacts of pesticides on immature stages of pollinators,\" she says, \"only adults.\"\nThe EPA participated in a stakeholder conference last year to discuss honeybee health (a report is just out from that event). An EPA spokesperson declined to comment on the pending lawsuit but noted that the agency has been working to speed up its review of research related to neonicotinoids and their effect on honeybees. It is also tweaking existing regulatory practices to address various concerns including pesticide dust drift, product label warnings, and enforcement of bee-kill investigations.\nBarrage of Stressors\nSo in addition to a changing climate and bizarre local weather systems, bees are threatened by chemical exposure in untested and unregulated combinations, disappearing foraging habitat with increasing monoculture that requires trucking bees from place to place, and fungal and viral intruders, plus the dreaded Varroa mite.\nMeanwhile, nature is not sitting still. The diseases that are taking out immune-suppressed bees are quick to evolve resistance to farmers' attempts to protect their bees. \"Based on our management surveys last year, not one commercial product against Varroa worked consistently,\" says vanEngelsdorp, citing numerous examples.\nWith the barrage of stressors bees face, perhaps we shouldn't be surprised that they're no longer as resilient as they once were. And honeybees, vanEngelsdorp points out, are among the most robust pollinators. The native insects, such as bumblebees, stingless bees, and flies, may be in worse shape, though their plights\u2014and role in the ecosystem\u2014are far less well known.\nMeanwhile, the lawsuit against the EPA is just revving up (the first hearing was March 15), and scientists continue to push hard to get more information on the unregulated ingredients in agrochemicals that are proving harmful. \"Unless we can get at what's actually being used on fields, we can't analyze their effects,\" says toxicologist Chris Mullin, a co-author of the Penn State adjuvant study. And some products, he says, \"are nearly 100 percent adjuvant. Illogically, they are considered safe until proven otherwise.\"\nOther voices have risen strongly against current land use practices. \"Honeybees need habitat,\" Browning says. \"That's any floral source with good nutrition. And that's not wheat, corn, or soy, crops that take up well over 60 percent of U.S. farmland.\" We've traded bee needs for biofuel, he laments, and we're paying the price.\n\"We also need good cooperation from [the] EPA\u2014and from farmers and pesticide applicators\u2014to implement and enforce best management practices,\" he says. Also on his wish list: a better battery of tools to effectively combat the Varroa mite, the bane of all beekeepers.\n\"Bee culture has adapted to fit monoculture, and that's not healthy,\" says Browning. \"If we can instead invest in good sustainable practices in agriculture, we can still thrive.\"\nBut his confidence in the future, along with that of many of his fellow beekeepers, is declining with his hives. \"We're just about tapped out,\" he says. \"Without some real action we'll see this industry dwindle away.\" And as the industry goes, so go the little yellow insects that put so much good food on our plates.\nJennifer S.

He dresses business casual and wears silver-rimmed glasses. He lives in Wellesley. He gardens. He has two children, one in high school, another in college. He occupies a tidy office in the Landmark Center, as an associate professor in the Harvard School of Public Health\u2019s Department of Environmental Health. And yet the mention of Lu\u2019s name in certain quarters elicits palpable discomfort: Oh, him.\n\nLu, who is 49 and goes by Alex, grew up a city kid in Taipei, the youngest of three siblings. He rode his bike to the baseball field, sometimes to the comic-book store. He knew little about agriculture, little about nature. Then he came to the United States for graduate school, first to Rutgers University and then to the University of Washington, where he got his PhD in environmental health. In the Pacific Northwest, Lu found his calling: tracking pesticide exposure in food, homes, and workplaces. The prevalence of these chemicals, he grew convinced, was a critical and understudied aspect of public health.\n\nContinue reading below\n\nFor nearly all this time, Ken Warchol was in Northbridge, teaching social studies to middle school and high school students, playing a 19th-century industrialist in historical reenactments, and coaching track and cross-country. On the side, Warchol, who is 63, tended to his lifelong passion of beekeeping, operating his own hives, helping other bee enthusiasts around Worcester County, and examining apiaries as a state inspector. \u201cMy whole life,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019ve been with bees.\u201d\nA sixth-generation beekeeper, Warchol traces the family tradition to Poland in the 1840s. His father brought the practice and tools with him to the United States after World War II. Several years later, Warchol, as a young boy, got his first hive from his father, who made him a wager: Whoever had more honey at collection time won dinner at the Bungalow, a restaurant down the road. Warchol can still remember the particulars of his victory. He had 84 pounds of honey to his dad\u2019s 76, and he got steak at the Bungalow. Only recently, as his mother was dying, did she spill the secret. His father had given him the strongest hive so he could win.\nDick Callahan grew up nearby in Worcester and earned a PhD in entomology from the University of Massachusetts, inspired by Rachel Carson\u2019s 1962 book Silent Spring, which chronicled the damage wrought by pesticides and sparked the modern environmental movement. After four years in the Air Force, he embarked on a career as a scientist and entrepreneur, running environmental surveys in the ocean, cofounding and taking public a pharmaceutical firm, and then helping others start their own companies. \u201cI\u2019m a real capitalist,\u201d the retired 72-year-old says.\nSuzanne Kreiter/Globe staff\nAlex Lu, Dick Callahan, and Ken Warchol open a hive in Northbridge, where they are studying the effects of pesticide exposure on honeybees. \n\nAbout 15 years ago, Callahan was wandering around a Worcester flower show at what is now the DCU Center. He came upon a beekeeping exhibit and thought, I\u2019ve always been interested in that. Soon after, he enrolled in a school run by the Worcester County Beekeepers Association. One of the instructors was Ken Warchol. They became friends and worked together on a government study of an eradication program for Asian long-horned beetles. Callahan went on to start several beehives of his own at his home in Holden and on a nearby farm.\nThe tale of how Lu, Warchol, and Callahan began collaborating is one chapter of a much larger story, a story of billions of vanishing honeybees and what their plight means for our dinner tables and health. It\u2019s a story of science and mystery, of politics and big business, of California almonds and Maine blueberries, of threatened livelihoods and jeopardized crops. It\u2019s a story about the high stakes and strong passions of environmental research. It\u2019s a story about chemicals, and what we know and don\u2019t know about their imprint.\nThis part of the story begins simply enough. In the fall of 2009, Lu and his son drove out to Keown Orchards in Sutton to watch Warchol give a presentation to beekeepers on preparing hives for the winter. Afterward, he introduced himself to Warchol as a Harvard scientist, asking Warchol to consider partnering with him on a research project.\nWarchol\u2019s first reaction was, the Harvard University? \u201cI got a 1,300 on my college boards,\u201d Warchol recalls telling him in an early conversation. \u201cI wasn\u2019t even close to getting into Harvard.\u201d Lu reassured the beekeeper. He wasn\u2019t looking for a student. What he needed was a teacher.\n\n***\n\nIN LATE 2006, beekeepers across the United States began reporting an ominous discovery: their honeybees were disappearing at unprecedented rates. Beekeepers, many of whom tended thousands of hives, were accustomed to losing 10 percent to 20 percent of their colonies each year. Normally, in diseased hives, piles of dead bees pooled at the bottom. This was different.\nDavid Hackenberg, a commercial beekeeper in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, sounded the alarm on 60 Minutes in 2007, explaining that he had lost a staggering two-thirds of his bees. Other beekeepers fared worse, losing up to 90 percent of their hives. Researchers termed the phenomenon \u201ccolony collapse disorder.\u201d In affected apiaries, bees were inexplicably abandoning their colonies, often leaving behind food and young. The bees weren\u2019t just lying there dead. They were gone. \u201cIt was like a ghost town,\u201d Hackenberg told 60 Minutes.\n\nThe phenomenon became an epidemic, wrecking colonies of small independent beekeepers and large commercial operations alike. Beekeepers who responded to an annual US Department of Agriculture-funded survey reported losing, on average, more than a third of their hives every year from 2006 to 2013, though not all losses have been attributed to colony collapse. Beekeepers in the Northeast have been among those hardest hit.\nAs the toll mounted, beekeepers, scientists, federal regulators, the media, and environmentalists groped for answers, blaming, at various points, climate change, poor nutrition, fungus, cell-tower radiation, mites, viruses, and even a purported scheme hatched by Russian spooks. The latest consensus among regulators and some scientists is that a combination of factors, including parasites, pesticide use, and increasingly homogenized American agriculture, is what\u2019s decimating the honeybee population. A US government report published in May concluded that \u201ca complex set of stressors and pathogens is associated with CCD, and researchers are increasingly using multi-factorial approaches to studying causes of colony losses.\u201d\nSuzanne Kreiter/Globe staff\nLu, Warchol, and Callahan\u2019s bees.\nThe urgency of solving the puzzle is undeniable. Honeybees are critical to the food supply. About one-third of what we put in our mouths benefits directly or indirectly from honeybee pollination, according to the USDA. Without bees, harvests dwindle and food prices rise.\nEvery year, commercial beekeepers truck hundreds of thousands of hives from state to state to pollinate a multitude of crops, from tree nuts in California to cranberries in Massachusetts. Many make a good part of their living through pollination contracts with growers. In recent years, the US honeybee supply has diminished to the point where growers have had to import pollinators.\nIn his previous research, Alex Lu had focused on human exposure to pesticides, making his name with a study in the Seattle area, first published in 2005, showing that switching children to a largely organic diet could quickly and dramatically reduce the amounts of pesticide residues in their bodies. He knew no more about honeybees than the average consumer.\nWhat he did know, however, was pesticides\u2009\u2014\u2009their complexity, their ubiquity, and their potency. Seeing David Hackenberg\u2019s story on 60 Minutes aroused his suspicions. Like Hackenberg himself, Lu had a hunch that pesticides, above all, were to blame for the vanishing bees. He wasn\u2019t the first to see a connection, but he was determined to prove one.\n\n***\n\n\nTHERE\u2019S A CERTAIN GENIUS to pesticides known as systemics. Unlike traditional pest-killing chemicals, which are usually sprayed on crops, lawns, and trees, systemic pesticides render a plant toxic to bugs from the inside out. Seeds are treated with pesticide before they\u2019re sowed (or sometimes the soil is pre-treated). When the plant grows, the poison essentially grows with it, spreading to all parts of the tissue and killing any snacking corn borers, rootworms, aphids, or stink bugs.\nThe big systemic pesticides these days are called neonicotinoids, which are derived from nicotine and target insects\u2019 nervous systems. They have exploded in popularity over the past decade, thanks to a perception that they are both safer and more effective than the pesticides they replaced. The vast majority of corn planted in the United States today is pre-treated with neonicotinoids, the seeds colored like candy. So are other major crops such as soybeans and canola.\nThe wind, not bees, pollinates corn, but bees can collect corn pollen. And neonicotinoid-laced pollen blows onto nearby flowers and crops, exposing honeybees to the poison. Neonicotinoids are also used on plants that bees do pollinate, including cucumbers and watermelons. Unlike older pesticides, neonicotinoids can linger in the soil for months or even years.\nThe more Lu learned about colony collapse, the more convinced he became that the epidemic\u2019s timing was no coincidence, coming as neonicotinoid use surged in American agriculture. With a $25,000 grant from Harvard, he began designing an experiment to test his hypothesis, aiming to replicate the honeybee disappearances that beekeepers were experiencing. It was clear neonicotinoids were acutely toxic to bees, just as they were to crop-eating insects, but what about at lower levels, over a prolonged period of time?\nLu, Warchol, and Callahan sketched out a plan. In the spring of 2010, they would set up 20 hives at four locations, two in Uxbridge and two in Northbridge. They would feed all the hives high fructose corn syrup, mimicking a common commercial beekeeping practice. (Beekeepers typically supplement their colonies\u2019 food supply with syrup or sugar.) In four of the five hives at each site, the syrup would contain imidacloprid, a commonly used neonicotinoid. The fifth hive, the control in the experiment, would be fed syrup not dosed with pesticide.\nThey began with a population of roughly 220,000 bees that grew into 1.4 million or so. On July 1, 2010, they started the pesticide regimen, beginning with very low doses, to make sure they didn\u2019t kill the bees right away. They upped the amounts after four weeks to levels that Lu says were on the conservative end of what bees encounter in the real world\u2009\u2014\u2009through syrup made from corn treated with neonicotinoids or nectar and pollen collected from contaminated flowers and crops. The four pesticide-laced hives at every site were given different concentrations of imidacloprid.\nSuzanne Kreiter/Globe staff\nPart of the hive in Northbridge.\nWinter came, and they saw nothing. The hives seemed fine. \u201cWe were starting to get discouraged,\u201d Warchol says. \u201cDick and I were talking, saying, \u2018Wow, there\u2019s really nothing going on.\u2019 \u201d Lu had the same reaction. \u201cAt that time,\u201d he says, \u201cI thought my hypothesis was wrong.\u201d\nThen everything started to change. Around the beginning of 2011, a beekeeper whose yard they were using as a testing site reported seeing a mass of bees suddenly fleeing one of the hives. It was suicide\u2009\u2014\u2009to endure the winter, honeybees typically cluster together inside their hive for warmth, surviving on food that a beekeeper has provided to sustain them. Some of the bees had dropped dead on the surrounding snow. The rest had disappeared.\nOver the next several weeks, Lu, Warchol, and Callahan lost 15 of the 16 hives they had fed imidacloprid. It resembled colony collapse disorder, with abandoned hives bearing plenty of food. \u201cIt was an exciting moment in a sense, even though the bees were dying,\u201d Warchol says. For Lu, it all clicked. \u201cIt\u2019s not Mother Nature,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s us.\u201d They lost one of their control hives to disease, but it looked very different from the hives the bees had fled, with dead bees littering the colony.\nWhen Lu, Warchol, and Callahan sought to publish their results, they encountered resistance. Some journals wouldn\u2019t take the manuscript. Peer reviewers raised objections. They finally published in 2012 in an Italian journal called the Bulletin of Insectology. They also wrote a letter alerting the US Environmental Protection Agency to their work, just as two European research teams announced similar findings.\nCritics challenged their science, the design of their experiment, and their conclusions. One California beekeeper was especially strident, going to great lengths to try to discredit their study. A leading bee researcher called it \u201can embarrassment.\u201d\nOthers, like May Berenbaum, head of the Department of Entomology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, offer more measured criticism. Berenbaum questions Lu\u2019s sample size, saying sweeping conclusions are impossible from 20 hives. She also cites a separate study that found no evidence of neonicotinoids in commercially available high fructose corn syrup, which she says undermines the premise of bees being exposed to pesticides through the food provided by beekeepers. (Lu dismisses these objections, saying 20 hives was plenty, statistically speaking, and that no historical record exists on neonicotinoid levels in corn syrup.)\nA self-described \u201ctree-hugger,\u201d Berenbaum is highly critical of systemic pesticides. She just hasn\u2019t seen enough evidence to support banning them. If and when it reaches that point, she says, \u201cI\u2019d be the first one in line\u201d pushing to restrict their use. \u201cIt\u2019s a seductively easy fix,\u201d she says, noting that many other chemical residues have been found in dead bees. \u201cBut like many seductively easy fixes, it is, I think, not likely to fix everything, or maybe even fix enough.\u201d\nFor Lu, the push-back to their study\u2009\u2014\u2009and the fact that no one, to his knowledge, sought to replicate it\u2009\u2014\u2009emboldened him to go back into the field. \u201cHe\u2019s a very passionate guy,\u201d Callahan says. \u201cThere\u2019s no question about it.\u201d\nSo Lu, Warchol, and Callahan established new testing hives at three sites in 2012. They varied their methods somewhat, in part by testing bees\u2019 exposure to both imidacloprid and another neonicotinoid called clothianidin. The results, they say, only reinforced their conclusion that pesticides are likely a major culprit behind colony collapse.\nAs last winter approached, the number of bees in all their test hives steadily dropped, which is normal for that time of year. But while the control hives started to rebound in January, the pesticide-treated hives did not. Lu is now finalizing the study in hopes of publishing the results in a journal soon. One factor he is investigating is whether neonicotinoids do more harm to honeybees in colder temperatures.\n\n***\n\n\nYOU COULD SPEND A LIFETIME reading studies and counter-studies on pesticides and their effects on plant, insect, and animal life. Suffice it to say that debate rages over the chemicals we rely on and their true costs and benefits. But Europe, where honeybees have also suffered, has seen enough to act.\nIn May, despite opposition from the United Kingdom and some other member countries, the European Commission adopted a ban on the use of three neonicotinoids on crops that attract bees and other pollinators. The ban, based on a risk assessment by European scientists, takes effect December 1 and will be reevaluated after two years at the latest. (A few European Union countries had already imposed their own such restrictions, and there\u2019s some evidence bee health has improved.) It\u2019s a step Lu and other critics of neonicotinoids say the United States should be taking. \u201cThe EU\u2019s ban is a slap in our face,\u201d he says.\nEurope and the United States, though, have different approaches to environmental regulation. Where Europe is willing to take products off the shelf until they can be proved safe, the United States often allows industry to sell products until they\u2019ve been proved harmful, a process that can take years.\nSuzanne Kreiter/Globe staff\nBees in Northbridge. \nThe EPA, in particular, has come under heavy criticism for allowing pesticide manufacturers to start selling new products after limited safety testing and then leaving it up to the companies themselves to provide further data down the road. \u201cIt\u2019s a formula that is designed to fail, and it\u2019s doing just that,\u201d says Steve Ellis, a longtime commercial beekeeper in Barrett, Minnesota, who says he lost 65 percent of his hives in the 2012-2013 winter. \u201cAnd the bee industry is failing because of it.\u201d Ellis belongs to a group of beekeepers and environmental organizations that filed a lawsuit against the EPA in March alleging the agency has been negligent in pesticide regulation.\nChas Mraz, a third-generation beekeeper in Middlebury, Vermont, also thinks systemic pesticides might be to blame for bee losses, which he has experienced himself, but he\u2019s pessimistic anything will be done about it. \u201cIt\u2019s just like nobody gives a damn about the beekeepers or a lot of other small enterprises in this country,\u201d he says.\nThe USDA and the EPA have been working jointly on honeybee health, trying to balance the importance of pest control to agriculture with the risks to pollinators. Kim Kaplan, a spokeswoman for the USDA\u2019s Agricultural Research Service, says pesticides are critical to food production and that crop yields would be substantially lower without them. \u201cWe have a lot of people to feed,\u201d she says. \u201cSo who goes without?\u201d \nThe government, Kaplan says, can\u2019t hastily take neonicotinoids off the shelf unless the science is clear, an argument echoed by EPA officials. Kaplan insists the government is looking hard at pesticides, including the scenario that chronic exposure is a catalyst that makes bees more susceptible to other problems.\nWhat does the government make of Lu\u2019s work on pesticides and honeybees? When I ask Kaplan about it, one of the first things she says is \u201cHave you read some of the critiques of his studies?\u201d In 2012, after he released the results of his first study, Lu says, he was disinvited from a meeting of the EPA\u2019s Scientific Advisory Panel. It was the kind of gathering he had participated in many times, and his research was certainly germane\u2009\u2014\u2009much of the meeting, the agenda suggests, dwelled on bees\u2019 exposure to pesticides. But Lu says he was told his work was too controversial. (The EPA denies that Lu was disinvited, saying there were simply more candidates than available slots at the meeting.)\nThe pesticide industry, meanwhile, downplays any risks posed by neonicotinoids, seeking to shift attention to other potential causes of dwindling bee colonies. Industry representatives make their case in detailed responses to news articles, through millions of dollars of lobbying in Washington, D.C., at government conferences, and on social media. Bayer, one of the biggest manufacturers, maintains a golden-hued Web page and Twitter account under the name Bayer Bee Care, where it promotes alternative explanations for why honeybees are disappearing. \nRay McAllister, senior director for regulatory policy for CropLife America, a pesticide industry association with more than 90 member companies, says his organization is committed to improving honeybee health. Like other industry representatives, he questions the pesticide levels Lu used in his study, saying they were significantly higher than those bees would find in the natural environment. \u201cIt\u2019s just difficult to draw any meaningful conclusions from the study,\u201d he says.\nBut what of the European ban? McAllister calls the decision politically motivated and the product of faulty science. What if, I ask him, honeybees in Europe bounce back after the two-year hiatus? \u201cI will be very surprised,\u201d he says.\nLu has come to expect this kind of response, seeing parallels to how Big Tobacco tried for years to deflect growing evidence of the health risks posed by smoking. The more pesticide companies can muddy the picture of what\u2019s happening to honeybees, Lu says, the better their business does. \u201cThis is just like a gold mine.\u201d\n\n***\n\n\nSuzanne Kreiter/Globe staff\n\n\nMORE THAN ANYTHING, HE REMEMBERS THE QUIET. It was the spring of 2011. Lu had driven out to Worcester County to see one of the apiary sites. Other hives were buzzing. But not the ones exposed to pesticide. \u201cThose four hives were dead silent,\u201d he says. The take-away, to him, was clear: \u201cThis,\u201d he thought, \u201cis the replication of Silent Spring.\u201d It was, as Rachel Carson had written about the absence of birds decades before, a \u201cspring without voices.\u201d\nLu has studied pesticide exposure in Seattle-area children, in migrant farm workers in Washington state, and in Boston Housing Authority tenants. He and his family try to buy organic food. They also grow fruits and vegetables themselves in eight raised beds. He describes honeybees as \u201ca wonderful gift that God gave to us.\u201d But he is hardly the radical anti-pesticide activist his critics may assume.\nHe calls pesticides \u201ca tool that we cannot afford to lose,\u201d given their importance to food production. He believes there\u2019s a responsible way to use pesticides, but that we\u2019re nowhere near that. \u201cI think it can be done,\u201d he says.\nCallahan thinks farmers should approach pesticides the way sensible people approach antibiotics: \u201cYou take it when you need it. You want to take it carefully. You want to know what you\u2019re doing. And you sure as hell would like to know the side effects.\u201d\nI heard a few people raise the idea of the honeybee as canary. Bees aside, what do we know about the consequences of our own chronic exposure to chemicals like neonicotinoids? \u201cVery little,\u201d Lu says. He sees promise in an emerging research field called metabolomics, which seeks to connect the dots between the body\u2019s short-term responses and reactions to things like chemical exposures and the subsequent development of disease.\nEven if Lu turns out to be right about neonicotinoids, still outstanding is the question of what chronic exposure actually does to bees physiologically. Does it impair their navigational and orientation capabilities, as some research suggests, prompting them to fly away? Does it indeed make them more susceptible to cold temperatures? Does the buildup of pesticide residues enhance bees\u2019 vulnerability to mites and pathogens? All of the above?\nIn a sense, Lu and the scientists, regulators, and companies skeptical of his work don\u2019t seem all that far apart. It may well be that several accomplices share responsibility for colony collapse. It\u2019s just that Lu is ready to pick neonicotinoids out of the lineup, and not everyone is.\nIf there\u2019s any upside to this crisis, it\u2019s widespread sympathy for honeybees, sparking new interest in beekeeping in urban areas such as Boston and New York, in the suburbs, and beyond. Some 320 beginners signed up for the Worcester County Beekeepers Association\u2019s Bee School in March, which Warchol says is the largest such class ever seen anywhere in Massachusetts. Chas Mraz says the same thing\u2019s happening in Vermont.\nFor veterans like Warchol, the allure of beekeeping has never worn off\u2009\u2014\u2009of tending to a flourishing hive, of harvesting its honey, of bearing witness to the intricate age-old ecosystem, with all the individuals working for the good of the whole. \u201cI still love it,\u201d Warchol says over a handsome breakfast at an Uxbridge diner. \u201cI go out there on a sunny afternoon. It\u2019s such a glorifying feeling to see this little micro-world\u2009\u2014\u2009how they work together\u2009\u2014\u2009and you learn so much from it. They all know their jobs. They do it well. They just know what to do to make a successful beehive.\u201d \n\nScott Helman is a Globe Magazine staff writer.

Alison Benjamin reports ...", "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/may/31/animalwelfare.environment", "Turn autoplay off\nTurn autoplay on\nPlease activate cookies in order to turn autoplay off\nDave Hackenberg's bees have been on the road for four days. To reach the almond orchards of California's Central Valley, they pass through the fertile plains of the Mississippi, huge cattle ranches and oilfields in Texas, and the dusty towns of New Mexico on their 2,600-mile journey from Florida. The bees will have seen little of the dramatic landscape, being cooped up in hives stacked four high on the back of trucks. Each truck carries close to 500 hives, tethered with strong harnesses and covered with black netting to prevent the millions of passengers from escaping. When the drivers pull over to sleep, the bees have a break from the constant movement and wind speed, but there's no opportunity to look around and stretch their wings. \nTheir final destination is some two hours north of Los Angeles. As the sun begins to fade over the vast, flat terrain, the convoy slowly snakes through orchards filled with row upon row of almond trees stretching as far as the eye can see. Every February, the valley plays host to billions of honeybees as trees burst into blossom, blanketing the landscape in a soft, pinkish hue which extends to the horizon. \nThe sandy loam and Mediterranean climate are perfect for the cultivation of almonds, but that's where any comparisons to picturesque orchards of Spain or Italy end. Here, there are no verdant weeds, wild flowers or grass verges to please the eye, just never-ending trees that form what looks like an outdoor production line. \nIn the cool hours after sunset and before sunrise, more than one million hives are unloaded at regular intervals between the trees by commercial beekeepers such as Dave Hackenberg, who have travelled from the far corners of the US to take part in the world's largest managed pollination event. The mammoth orchards of Central Valley stretch the distance from London to Aberdeen, and the 60 million almond trees planted with monotonous uniformity along the 400-mile route require half of all the honeybees in the US to pollinate them - a staggering 40 billion. \nBy February 16, National Almond Day in the US, the trees are usually covered in flowers and humming with the sound of busy bees. Attracted by the sweet nectar that each flower offers, the bees crawl around on the petals to find the perfect sucking position. As they do so, their furry bodies are dusted with beads of pollen. As they fly from blossom to blossom in search of more of the sweet energy drink, they transfer pollen from the male part of the flower to the female part, and so fertilise it. Not long afterwards, the plant's ovaries swell into fruit, which by late August turn into precious, oval-shaped nuts.\nWithout this army of migrant pollinators paying a visit for three weeks every year, the trees would fail to bear the almonds that are California's most valuable horticultural export. Last year, they earned the state more than $1.9bn, double the revenue from its Napa Valley vineyards. Moreover, 80% of the world's almonds now come from this pocket of the planet. But the supply of almonds in confectionery, cakes and packets of nuts is now threatened by a mysterious malady that is causing honeybees to disappear. \nHackenberg was the first beekeeper to report that his bees had vanished. On a November day 18 months ago, he checked the hives in his Florida bee yard to find they were empty. \"They weren't dead, they were just gone,\" he recalls. \nSince then, close on two million colonies of honeybees across the US have been wiped out. The strange phenomenon, dubbed colony collapse disorder (CCD), is also thought to have claimed the lives of billions of honeybees around the world. In Taiwan, 10 million honeybees were reported to have disappeared in just two weeks, and throughout Europe honeybees are in peril. \nIn Britain, John Chapple was the first to raise the alarm. In January 2007, he lost all of the 14 colonies in his garden in west London. \"It's too cold at that time of year to open the hives,\" he says, \"so I always check on the bees by giving the hive a thump and waiting for what sounds like a roaring sound to come back. But there was nothing, just silence.\" When he opened the hives to see what had happened, he found them practically empty. Examination of a further 26 hives scattered across the capital revealed that two-thirds had perished. \n\"I was completely shocked,\" says Chapple, who chairs the London Beekeepers' Association. \"I could attribute some losses to a failing queen bee or wax moths, but there were a few I could find no reason for. There was a healthy queen and a few bees, but nothing else.\" Chapple's inquiries as to whether the parks where he kept some of his hives had sprayed new pesticides also drew a blank. \nHe was not alone. Beekeepers in north-west London also reported strange losses. Chapple calls the disappearance the \"Mary Celeste syndrome\". A year later, a survey of hives by government bee inspectors across Britain has found that one in five colonies has perished this winter.\nThere are some 270,000 honeybee hives in Britain run by 44,000 keepers, more than 90% of them amateurs. According to estimates by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), bees contribute \u00a3165m a year to the economy through their pollination of fruit trees, field beans and other crops. In addition, the 5,000 tonnes of British honey sold in UK stores generates a further \u00a312m.\nUK farming minister Lord Rooker, however, warned last year that honeybees are in acute danger: \"If nothing is done about it, the honeybee population could be wiped out in 10 years,\" he said. Last month, he launched a consultation on a national strategy to improve and protect honeybee health.\nPeople's initial response to the idea of a bee-less world is often either, \"That's a shame, I'll have no honey to spread on my toast\" or, \"Good - one less insect that can sting me.\" In fact, honeybees are vital for the pollination of around 90 crops worldwide. In addition to almonds, most fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds are dependent on honeybees. Crops that are used as cattle and pig feed also rely on honeybee pollination, as does the cotton plant. So if all the honeybees disappeared, we would have to switch our diet to cereals and grain, and give our wardrobes a drastic makeover.\nAccording to Albert Einstein, our very existence is inextricably linked to bees - he is reputed to have said: \"If the bee disappears off the surface of the globe, then man would only have four years of life left.\" \nBees are a barometer of what man is doing to the environment, say beekeepers; the canary in the coalmine. Just as animals behave weirdly before an earthquake or a hurricane, cowering in a corner or howling in the wind, so the silent, empty hives are a harbinger of a looming ecological crisis. But what is causing them to vanish - pesticides, parasites, pests, viruses? No one knows for sure. The more fanciful theories when CCD was first detected included an al-Qaida plot to wreck US agriculture, radiation from mobile phones and even celestial intervention in the form of honeybee rapture.\nScientists around the world are trying to pinpoint the culprit, but it is proving elusive. They have even set up an international network to monitor honeybee losses - a sort of Interpol for bees - which is operating out of Switzerland. Its coordinator, bee pathologist Dr Peter Neumann, blames a bloodsucking mite called varroa. Little bigger than a pinhead, it has preyed on honeybees in Europe and the US since its arrival 30 years ago. Under a microscope, the reddish-brown mite looks like a cross between a jellyfish and a Frisbee. It activates lethal viruses in honeybees and carries them from bee to bee when it feeds on their blood, like a dirty syringe spreading HIV/Aids. \"It has to be the backbone of the problem,\" Neumann says. \"But it is probably not acting alone.\"\nIn the US, where the genetic code of the honeybee was unravelled by scientists two years ago, they have been employing advanced technology to discover if a new virus is responsible for killing the bees. Genome sequencing techniques uncovered the DNA of a virus called Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV) that was found in almost all of the hives suffering from CCD. The discovery, published in Science, was hailed as a major breakthrough in the investigation. But honeybees are riddled with latent viruses. They become a problem and cause disease only when the bee's immune system is shot. Like humans, they are prone to illness when they are stressed and run-down. So the real question is, what is making the bees too weak to fight a virus?\nThe answer is probably overwork, coupled with various environmental factors that are the flipside of pollination on an industrial scale and intensified food production. After Hackenberg's bees have pollinated the almonds in California, they head north to the apple orchards of Washington State, then east for the cranberries and pumpkins, before reaching Maine in May to pollinate blueberries. In a year, they can cover 11,000 miles. It's a well-worn route that's travelled by many of the 1,000 commercial beekeepers in America who between them own 90% of the country's 2.4 million honeybee colonies. It is pollination, rather than honey production, that keeps US beekeepers in business. In 2007, honey production was worth $160m to the US economy, compared with pollination services that have been estimated at $15bn.\nJoe Traynor is a California bee broker. From a small office in a quiet side street in downtown Bakersfield, on the southern tip of Central Valley, he runs a lucrative business matching almond growers with beekeepers. I put to him that surely all this moving around of bees, confined to their hives for long periods, must be stressful for them. He admits that too much travel is not good for their health: \"When you're trucking bees, they need sleep, just as humans do, and the bumping around in the truck for two to three days keeps them awake, and this lowers their resistance to pests and disease.\"\nHackenberg, however, disagrees: \"I've been doing this 40-odd years. We've done all the same things, but the rules have changed. Something's messing up.\"  \nHackenberg, 59, wears cowboy boots, a checked shirt and blue jeans. He even has a hard hat in the shape of a Stetson, with netting attached that he wears when unloading beehives. He began his own investigations into what killed 2,000 of his honeybees at the end of 2006, by talking to growers and reading up on pesticide use and research into their effects on bees. \"It's those new neonicotinoid pesticides that growers are using,\" he says. \"That's what's messing up the bees' navigation system so they can't find their way home.\" \nHoneybees have a sophisticated dance language  they use to communicate with each other in the hive. Until Karl von Frisch unlocked the mysteries of this  dance - his discovery won him a Nobel prize in 1973 - we didn't fully appreciate that bees returning to the hive laden with nectar and pollen will tell their sisters (all worker bees are female) where they got their supplies by doing a dance that points to the location of the flowers in relation to the sun's position.\nTests have shown that the pesticides Hackenberg refers to can interfere with the bees' communication and orientation skills, and also impair memory.\nWith innocuous brand names such as Gaucho, Assail and Merit, these pesticides are used worldwide, from sunflower fields to apple orchards, lawns to golf courses. The chemicals they contain are an artificial type of nicotine that acts as a neurotoxin that attacks insects' nervous systems on contact or ingestion. Because it is systemic, the chemical moves throughout a plant, so if it is applied as a seed dressing, it will travel to the shoots, stem, leaves and flowers where bees can come into contact with small doses. Many of these widely used pesticides are classified by the US Environmental Protection Agency as \"highly toxic to bees\" and come with a warning label intended to help prevent their exposure to the pollinators. \n\"It's in such small print that the growers don't see it,\" Hackenberg says. He accuses farmers of \"stacking\" - or mixing - pesticides, herbicides and fungicides. \"No one has ever tested what happens to the toxicity if they do mix, simply because the chemical companies are not required to by law, but this combination could be a thousand times more lethal than if the chemicals are applied separately.\"\nIn Britain, beekeeping is very small-scale compared with the US. There are a few hundred professional beekeepers, who run an average of 100 hives each; only around 50 of them transport bees to orchards, usually over distances of 25 or so miles, rather than across a continent. Many orchards provide a year-round home for hives kept by amateur beekeepers, so there is no need for migratory beekeepers. But in this country, as in the rest of Europe, it is hard to escape pesticides and the varroa mite.\nIn France, beekeepers have for more than a decade waged a war against the chemical giant Bayer CropScience. They hold responsible the company's bestselling pesticide, imidacloprid, trade name Gaucho, for killing a third of the country's 1.5 million colonies. In 1999, the French government banned the use of Gaucho on sunflower crops after thousands took to the streets in protest. Two further pesticides were banned because of their potential link to bee deaths. It appeared to stem the massive bee die-offs for a time, even though the manufacturers' own tests demonstrated there is no correlation, and a long-term study by the French food safety agency revealed no significant differences in death rates before and after pesticides were banned. This winter, bee deaths across France are reported to have shot up again to 60%. \nBayer is also being blamed by German beekeepers for the eerie silence along the Rhine valley, where the buzzing of bees is a common sound at this time of year. They say two-thirds of honeybees have been killed this month by the pesticide clothianidin, sold under the trade name Poncho, which has been widely applied on sweet corn. As a result of the bee deaths, eight pesticides, including clothianidin, have been temporarily suspended in Germany. Anecdotal evidence of pesticide-related bee deaths in Italy and Holland is also piling up. \nEuropean beekeepers accuse scientists and government agencies of being in the pocket of the chemical companies. It's a similar story in the US, where scientists maintain that there is no correlation between the bees' disappearance and pesticide use. According to Hackenberg: \"Big Ag has control of the USDA [the US Department of Agriculture] from the secretary right down to the lowest guy on the totem pole.\"\nJeff Pettis is not sure where he comes on the pole. The senior manager at the federal bee laboratory in Maryland, he's the man responsible for coordinating the US government's response to CCD. Pettis advises some beekeepers may do well to forgo the almond pollination and rest their bees. \"You are getting them ready for February when the sunlight hours and the temperature are telling them it's too early in the year to be foraging at full strength,\" he says. \nDeceiving bees is an essential part of the business. Beekeepers dupe them into thinking it's already summer by moving them to warm locations in winter and feeding them an array of protein and energy supplements. The more food that comes into the hive, the more eggs the queen lays, to create more of the worker bees to go out and pollinate. \nThe bee broker Joe Traynor says the deception goes much further than trucking bees south. \"We're interfering with their natural cycle because we want strong colonies for almond pollination. We're stimulating hives in August, September and October, and making the queens do a lot more laying. As a result the queens are suffering burnout. It used to be that a beekeeper could pretty much leave his bees alone during winter. That's no longer the case.\"\nMoreover, scientists funded by the Almond Board of California are now experimenting with artificial pheromones that trick bees into thinking there are more larvae in the hive that need feeding, so they forage more, and in the process pollinate more almond blossom.\nThis is the Almond Board's profit-driven response to a potential shortfall of honeybees: to work even harder those that remain. Bees are being treated as a machine with no consideration for their life cycle and downtimes. And any machine pushed to its limits and not well maintained will break.\nEnvironmentalists argue for conservation measures on land planted with single crops that will both improve honeybee nutrition and attract wild pollinators that could shoulder some of the honeybees' workload. Monoculture, the hallmark of modern agriculture, covers much of the world's 1.5bn hectares of arable land. Single-crop plantations and orchards can stretch for hundreds of kilometres. The advantages for the farmer are manifold: the crop blooms at the same time, can be treated with the same pesticides and can be harvested together for maximum efficiency. But for honeybees, pollen collected from one crop does not provide a balanced, nutritious diet. Scientists agree that malnourished bees are more susceptible to disease and pesticide poisoning, while the best-fed are the hardiest. \nPlanting hedgerows of wild flowers would give honeybees a more varied menu. While this has happened in Europe, US almond growers have proved resistant to the idea, concerned that the bees would make fewer visits to the almond blossom if they had a choice. But hedgerows would also provide food and habitat for other pollinators such as butterflies, bumblebees and solitary bees. There are 4,500 wild bee species in North America that are capable of pollinating myriad fruits and vegetables - some more efficiently than honeybees. \nCould they prevent a pollination crisis if honeybees become extinct? Only if they have somewhere to make a home in the orchards and fields, and something to eat after the single crop has bloomed. Monoculture deprives them on both counts. \nThe Xerces Society runs a pollinator conservation project in northern California. Farms in Yolo County receive a mixture of plants that flower throughout the year and nest blocks for wild bees, and they keep large areas of soil untilled for native bees to live on. They say they have seen the return of native bees and benefited from their pollination services. But final details being hammered out in a farm bill on Capitol Hill look like trimming conservation budgets and reducing financial incentives for farmers to manage their land in a more pollinator-friendly way.  \nSo growers will continue to be increasingly reliant on honeybees to do a job once performed by a host of different insects. Their profits now hinge as much on honeybees' availability to pollinate fields as they do on the sun and rain. This is why there is such urgency in solving the mystery of disappearing and dying bees.\nThis is not the first time that honeybees have disappeared. The first recorded unexplained loss was in the US 150 years ago and ever since large numbers have vanished at intervals throughout North America, Europe and Australia. An epidemic first reported on the Isle of Wight wiped out 90% of honeybee colonies in the UK at the beginning of the 20th century. Then, as now, the main suspects were deficiencies in the bees' diet, pollution in the environment, pests and parasites and mismanagement by beekeepers, but the killer was never identified.\nWhen bees die, beekeepers can restock their hives quickly by buying a new queen who lays 2,000 eggs a day at her peak. Across the world, most have chosen to fill their apiaries with a type of honeybee renowned for its gentle nature and prodigious honey production skills. This race of bee, originally from Italy, now dominates beekeeping. The downside is that the honeybee gene pool has been diminished and with it traits that may have helped bees fend off mites and other parasites, such as a new fungal bacteria, Nosema ceranae, that attacks its gut.\nThere are fears that mites are becoming increasingly resistant to chemicals administered by beekeepers to kill them. Pettis says we are controlling too many bee ailments with drugs and a more organic approach is needed that includes stocking apiaries with locally reared bees better adapted to local climate and environmental conditions.\nMeanwhile scientists are hoping to use the mapping of the honeybee genome to engineer in the laboratory a super bee that has the resilience to withstand varroa but retains all the qualities of the Italian bee. Biologists will tell you, however, that it will  be only a matter of time before a super bee breeds a super parasite. Geneticists also discovered that honeybees have fewer genes providing resistance to disease than other insects. In particular, the number of genes responsible for detoxification appear to be smaller, making it unusually sensitive to pesticides and poisons. Its large-scale disappearance across the US and high death rates in Europe are signalling that industrialised farming makes demands on honeybees that are not sustainable. \nCentral Valley has been described as a big brothel where billions of honeybees from all over the US can pick up a contagious illness and take it home. It's spread by mites from infected to healthy colonies. And there are plans to expand Central Valley's almond orchards to the point where, by 2011, they will require 1.6 million honeybee colonies for pollination. \nDespite around a third of all US honeybees being wiped out last year, and again this year after beekeepers had restocked their hives, the almond pollination has yet to suffer. Why?\nThere are two answers. The shortage of honeybees has pushed up the price of hive rentals for almond pollination to an all-time high of $140 per hive, so more and more beekeepers are making the trip west, and the Almond Board's requirement of two hives each containing 20,000-30,000 bees per acre to pollinate the almonds is excessive, but provides a buffer should some of the hives be empty.\nAs the sun rises over the almond orchards after another nocturnal delivery of east coast hives, Hackenberg says it's only the money that brings him and his waning bees to California each year. \"I'd rather be back in Florida with my bees. They'd be feeding on the maple and willow. It's paradise down there. Why would anyone come to this godforsaken place? But something's got to pay the bills. I'm here for a $150,000 cheque.\"\n\u00b7 A World Without Bees, by Alison Benjamin and Brian McCallum, is published by Guardian Books at \u00a38.99 plus p&p.

In years past,\u00a0much of the bee industry has focused on beekeeping in regards to agriculture and farming. While the bee industry is vital to large agriculture that feeds much of the world, reality is that 98% of all who keep bees\u00a0are backyard beekeepers. Most of them are in towns, cities,\u00a0suburban areas, and not\u00a0on traditional farms.\n\nConcerned citizens are increasingly getting involved as the plight of the honey bees becomes better understood. Many municipalities and townships are removing\u00a0anti-beekeeping laws and restrictive codes. Many now know that honey bees are the pollinators of backyard gardens, and are vital for the overall health of the environment. Beekeeping is not just about large farms and mono-agriculture.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWe encourage groups participating in National Honey Bee Day activities to use the 2014 message in their activities. It has wide appeal for gardening groups, homeowners, schools, and nature lovers invbolved with birds, butterflies, etc.\n\u00a0\nWith the \"Sustainable Gardening Begins with Honey Bees, we \nsuggest the following for participants to consider:\n\u00a0\nOpen House Programs - Inviting the public to visit a bee yard, with \nthe ability to hold a frame of bees is probably the most powerful \nexperience you can offer in getting folks interested in beekeeping.\u00a0\nAny association or beekeeper can locally advertise and host potential \nnew beekeepers for a visit.\n\u00a0\nBeginner Programs - A short presentation perhaps at a environmental \ncenter allows new potential beekeepers to get the basic information \n(and interest) needed to get started.\n\u00a0\nThe 2014 theme allows bee associations to sign up new members, beekeepers to get others involved, sell honey, and educate the public \non beekeeping, and even inform local politicians as to why beekeeping \nis so important. While we do not mandate\u00a0National Honey Bee Day participants to use the yearly selected themes, we do ask that you \nconsider incorporating the overall message into your program. \nThe National Honey Bee Day program is not about beekeepers, it is \nabout educating the public, expanding the bee industry, and building \nbridges for the future. And we hope the 2014 NHBD theme allows you \nto accomplish that goal. Thank you.\n\nThe primary goals of the National Honey Bee Day Program include:\n\u00a0\n1) Promotion and advancement of beekeeping.\n\u00a0\n2) Educate the public about honey bees and beekeeping.\n\u00a0\n3) Make the public aware of environmental concerns as they effect honey bees.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0*********************************************************************\n\u00a0*********************************************************************\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nImportant Message to Beekeepers, \nBee Groups, and the Public:\n\u00a0\nWhile great strides have been made in recent years in \ngetting ordinances passed allowing beekeeping once \nagain in many parts of the country, there are also ongoing \nefforts in some locations trying to ban or severly restrict beekeeping elsewhere. Building support within your own \ncommunity is as important as ever in the bee industry.\n\u00a0\nInvite key local politicians such as the mayor, township supervisors, zoning board members, and state politicians \nto your National Honey Bee Day event. Build bridges, and \nconnect with others who could possibly help in the future. \nThe\u00a0bee industry, and your local bee community, can benefit greatly from connecting with others and getting more \neducated in beekeeping. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Get Involved. Be proactive...not reactive!\n\n\nThe National Honey Bee Day program started with a simple concept. Bring together beekeepers, bee associations, as well as other interested groups to connect with the communities to advance beekeeping. By working together and harnessing the efforts that so many already accomplish, and using a united effort one day a year, the rewards and message is magnified many times over. We encourage bee associations, individuals, and other groups to get involved. The program is free and open to all.\nSponsor and Contributors\n\u00a0\nThe National Honey Bee Day program operates and is funded by the generosity of our sponsors and contributors.

The latest version, the Amel_4.5 assembly, is available in GenBank. The version 4.0 assembly was published in October 2006.\nThe honey bee is important in the agricultural community as a producer of honey and as a facilitator of pollination. It is a model organism for studying the following human health issues: immunity, allergic reaction, antibiotic resistance, development, mental health, longevity and diseases of the X chromosome. In addition, biologists are interested in the honey bee's social organization and behavioral traits.\nSequencing of the honey bee is jointly funded by National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) and the Department of Agriculture (USDA). Multiple drones from the same queen (strain DH4) were obtained from Danny Weaver of B. Weaver Apiaries.\nAll libraries were made from DNA isolated from these drones. The honey bee BAC library (CHORI-224) was prepared by Pieter de Jong and Katzutoyo Osoegawa at the Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute.\nPublications include a main paper in Nature and up to forty companion papers in Genome Research and Insect Molecular Biology.

See the alignments for the different assemblies (1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 2.0, 3.0).\nTraces are available from the NCBI Trace Archive by using the link, which can be searched using NCBI MegaBLAST with a same species or cross species query.\nAdditional sequence data generated using the Roche 454 platform can be downloaded from the 454 Sequence Data site or searched using BLAST.\nHoney Bee SNP Data\nAfricanized honey bee sequences were aligned to the genome assembly to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms. The sequence reads are available from the NCBI Trace Archive link in the sidebar. The SNP analysis results are also available for download using the FTP Data link.\nSingle nucleotide polymorphisms were also identified in the haplotypes present in the genome assembly.\nAssemblies\nThis project was proposed to the BCM-HGSC by a group of dedicated insect biologists, headed by Gene Robinson. Following a workshop at the BCM-HGSC and a honey bee white paper, the HGSC began the project in 2002. A 6-fold coverage WGS, BAC sequence from pooled arrays, and an initial genome assembly (Amel_v1.0) were released beginning in 2003. This has been a challenging project with difficulty in recovering AT-rich regions. The WGS data had lower coverage in AT-rich regions and BAC data from clones showed evidence of internal deletions. Additional reads from AT enriched DNA addressed these underrepresented regions.\nThe assembly Amel_4.0 was produced with the Atlas assembly system and published in a paper in Nature and companion papers in Genome Research and Insect Molecular Biology.\nIt includes 2.7 million reads (1.8 Gb) or 7.5x coverage of the (clonable) genome. About 97% of STSs, 98% of ESTs, and 96% of cDNAs are represented in the 231 Mb assembly.\nInitial SNP data was prepared using about 2,500 reads produced from a strain of Africanized bees. The data is available in dbSNP and the NCBI Trace Archive.\nAnalysis of the genome by a consortium of 20 labs has been completed. This produced a gene list derived from five different methods melded through the GLEAN software.\n\nStephen Richards, Ph.D.\nBCM Home | BCM Intranet | Privacy Notices | Contact BCM | BCM Site Map\nBaylor College of Medicine Human Genome Sequencing Center\n\tMail: One Baylor Plaza, MS: BCM226, Houston, TX 77030\n\tPhone: 713-798-6539 | Fax: 713-798-5741\n\tE-mail: questions@hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu"], ["ADW: Apis mellifera: INFORMATION", "http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Apis_mellifera/", "Apis mellifera is native to Europe, western Asia, and Africa.  Human introduction of Apis mellifera to other continents started in the 17th century, and now they are found all around the world, including east Asia, Australia and North and South America.  (Sammataro and Avitabile, 1998; Winston, et al., 1981)\nEuropean honeybees prefer habitats that have an abundant supply of suitable flowering plants, such as meadows, open wooded areas, and gardens. They can survive in grasslands, deserts, and wetlands if there is sufficient water, food, and shelter. They need cavities (e.g. in hollow trees) to nest in.  (Milne and Milne, 2000; Winston, et al., 1981)\nGenerally, Apis mellifera are red/brown with black bands and orange yellow rings on abdomen. They have hair on thorax and less hair on abdomen. They also have a pollen basket on their hind legs. Honeybee legs are mostly dark brown/black.\nThere are two castes of females, sterile workers are smaller (adults 10-15 mm long), fertile queens are larger (18-20 mm). Males, called drones, are 15-17 mm long at maturity. Though smaller, workers have longer wings than drones. Both castes of females have a stinger that is formed from modified ovipositor structures. In workers, the sting is barbed, and tears away from the body when used. In both castes, the stinger is supplied with venom from glands in the abdomen. Males have much larger eyes than females, probably to help locate flying queens during mating flights.\nThere are currently 26 recognized subspecies of Apis mellifera, with differences based on differences in morphology and molecular characteristics. The differences among the subspecies is usually discussed in terms of their agricultural output in particular environmental conditions. Some subspecies have the ability to tolerate warmer or colder climates. Subspecies may also vary in their defensive behavior, tongue length, wingspan, and coloration. Abdominal banding patterns also differ - some darker and some with more of a mix between darker and lighter banding patterns.\nHoneybees are partially endothermic -- they can warm their bodies and the temperature in their hive by working their flight muscles.  (Clarke, et al., 2002; Milne and Milne, 2000; Pinto, et al., 2004; Seeley, et al., 1982)\nHoneybees build a hive out of wax secretions from their bodies, and queens lay their eggs in cells in the wax. The speed of subsequent development of the young is strongly affected by temperature, and is fastest at 33-36\u00b0C.\nHoneybees are holometabolous insects, and have four stages in the life cycle: egg, larva, pupa, and adult.\nA. mellifera eggs hatch in 28-144 hours, depending on their temperature. The larva that emerges is a small white grub. It stays in its wax cell, growing, and is fed and groomed by adult workers. The food that a female larva receives determines whether it will be a queen or worker. At 34\u00b0C, larvae feed and grow for 4-5 days, queens for 6 days, and males for 6-7 days. At the end of that period their cell is sealed by adult workers, and the larva molts, spins a silk cocoon, and transforms into the pupa stage. Pupae undergo a massive metamorphosis that takes about 7-8 days for queens, 12 days for workers, and 14-15 days for males. Once their final metamorphosis is complete, they chew their way out of the cell and begin their adult life. They will not grow or molt after emerging. Adult workers will live for 2-4 weeks in the summer, or as long as 11 months if they live through the winter. Males only survive for 4-8 weeks, and do not live through the winter. Queens live 2-5 years.\n. The next stage is the larval stage where the larva is fed the royal jelly, pollen/nectar, and honey combination. Next the larva goes into the pupae stage where it caps itself into its cell to metamorphose into the mature stage.\nQueens normally take 16 days to reach maturity, the worker bees take 21 days, and the drone takes 24 days to mature.  (Adjare, 1990; Sammataro and Avitabile, 1998)\nThe great majority of female A. mellifera in a hive are sterile workers. Only queens mate and lay eggs. Normally there is only a single reproductive queen in a hive.\nDuring periods of suitably mild weather in spring and summer, males leave the hive and gather at \"drone assembly areas\" near the hive. Virgin queens will fly through these areas, attracting the males with pheromones. The males pursue, and attempt to mate with the queen in flight. Sometimes a \"comet\" forms, as a cluster of males forms around the female, with a string of other males trying to catch up. Each male who succeeds in mating drops away, and dies within a few hours or days. Males who do not mate will continue to loiter in the assembly areas until they mate or die trying. Queens will mate with up to 10 males in a single flight.\nQueens may mate with males from their own hive, or from other hives in the area. The queen's mating behavior is centered around finding the best place to mate beforehand, by taking directional flights for a period of time, lasting no more than a couple of days. Afterward, she leaves the hive and flies to mate with drones in an assembly area. This normally starts to occur after their first week of birth. The queen does this up to four times. After this congregate of mating has occurred, she never mates again in her lifetime.  (Adjare, 1990; Sammataro and Avitabile, 1998; Tarpy and Page Jr., 2000)\nApis mellifera queens are the primary reproducers of the nest and all of the activities of the colony are centered around their reproductive behaviors and their survival. The queen is the only fertile female in the colony. She lays eggs nearly continuously throughout the year, sometimes pausing in late fall in cold climates. A particularly fertile queen may lay as many as 1,000 eggs/day, and 200,000 eggs in her lifetime. It takes a queen about 16 days to reach adulthood, and another week or more to begin laying eggs. Males take about 24 days to emerge as adults, and begin leaving the nest for assembly areas a few days after that.\nQueen honeybees can control whether or not an egg they lay is fertilized. Unfertilized eggs develop as males and are haploid (have only one set of chromosomes). Fertilized eggs are diploid (two sets of chromosomes) and develop as workers or new queens, depending on how they are fed as larvae. Queens may increase the ratio of male to female eggs they lay if they are diseased or injured, or in response to problems in the colony.\nHealthy, well-fed honeybee colonies reproduce by \"swarming.\" The workers in the colony begin by producing numerous queen larvae. Shortly before the new queens emerge, the resident, egg-laying queen leaves the hive, taking up to half the workers with her. This \"swarm\" forms a temporary group in a tree nearby, while workers scout for a suitable location for a new hive. Once they find one, the swarm moves into the space, and begins building comb and starting the process of food collection and reproduction again.\nMeanwhile at the old hive, the new queens emerge from their cells. If the population of workers is large enough, and there are few queens emerging, then the first one or two may leave with \"afterswarms\" of workers. After the swarming is completed, any remaining new queens try to sting and kill each other, continuing to fight until all but one is dead. After her competition is removed, the surviving queen begins to lay eggs.\nNormally the pheromones secreted by a healthy queen prevent workers from reproducing, but if a colony remains queenless for long, some workers will begin laying eggs. These eggs are unfertilized, and so develop as males.  (Adjare, 1990; Milne and Milne, 2000; Sammataro and Avitabile, 1998; Tarpy and Page Jr., 2000)\nAs in most eusocial insects, the offspring of fertile females (queens) are cared for other members of the colony. In honeybees, the caretakers are sterile females, daughters of the queen, called workers.\nWorkers build and maintain the comb where young bees are raised, gather food (nectar and pollen) feed and tend larvae, and defend the hive and its young from predators and parasites.\nYoung queens inherit their hive from their mothers. Often several new queens emerge after the old queen leaves with a swarm to found a new colony. The new queens fight for control of the hive, and only one survives the conflict.  (Adjare, 1990; Sammataro and Avitabile, 1998)\nApis mellifera queens usually live 2 to 3 years, but some have been known to last for 5 years. Workers typically only live for a few weeks, sometimes a few months if their hive becomes dormant in winter. Males live for 4-8 weeks at the most.  (Tarpy and Page Jr., 2000)\nEuropean honeybees are eusocial insects. They live in colonies that contain one reproductive female (the queen) and her offspring. Sterile female offspring of the queen (the workers) perform all the work of the colony and are by far the most numerous caste in the hive. Males and queens spend all their effort on reproduction, see the Reproduction sections for information on mating behavior and egg production.\nA. mellifera workers show what is called \"age polyethism.\" Their behaviors change as they get older. Newly emerged workers clean cells, preparing them for a new egg or for food storage. After a few days they shift to other hive maintenance work, removing waste and debris, fanning to maintain air circulation and temperature, processing nectar brought by foragers, and feeding the queen and larvae from glands in their head and body. In their second week of adult life workers' wax glands become active and they help build and repair the comb, while continuing to tend the queen and feed workers. Apis mellifera workers build a \"comb\", a sheet of hexagonal cells made of waxes they secrete. Each cell can house one larval bee, and cells are also used as protected storage space for honey (processed nectar) and pollen.\nBetween 12 and 25 days, workers take a turn guarding the hive, inspecting any bees that try to enter the hive - driving off strangers and attacking any other creatures that try to enter.  After about three weeks, the workers food and wax glands atrophy, and they shift to foraging duty.\nForaging only occurs during daylight, but bees are active in the hive continuously.\nIn temperate climates, colonies store honey and pollen to feed on during the winter. During cold temperatures the workers and queen form a tight ball or cluster, working their flight muscles to generate heat and keep themselves warm. In warmer tropical regions, honeybees maintain smaller stores of food.\nIf a colony's nest conditions become too poor, the entire colony may move to a new site. This is particularly common in tropical honeybees, that move in response to seasonal drought. Beekeepers call this \"absconding\", and work to prevent it in domesticated colonies.\nSwarming is a behavior in a nest where a new queen is born that takes the place of the older one in that hive. The departing queen normally takes some of the workers with her.  Swarming bees send out worker scouts to look for a suitable home to take the place of the one they left. The swarm of bees is just temporary. They normally swarm over a twig or branch of a tree or anywhere that can be used temporarily as an intermediate nest.  (Adjare, 1990; Sammataro and Avitabile, 1998)\nHoneybees forage as close to the hive as possible, usually within a 3 kilometer radius around the hive (i.e. an area of about about 2800 hectares). If necessary, they can fly as far as 8-13 km to reach food or water.  (Percival, 1947; Sammataro and Avitabile, 1998)\nApis mellifera communication is based on chemical signals, and most of their communication and perception behaviors are centered around scent and taste. The members of the hive colony are bound chemically to each other. Each hive has a unique chemical signature that hivemates use to recognize each other and detect bees from other colonies.\nWithin the hive, bees are in constant chemical communication with each other. Workers feed and groom each other, as well as larvae, drones, and the queen. In the process they pass on pheromones, chemical signals that indicate information about the health of the queen and the state of the colony.\nChemicals not only help with detecting the right signature of hives but also with foraging. Honeybees use scent to locate flowers from a distance. When a successful forager returns to the hive, it passes the scent of the flowers to its nest mates, to help them find the same patch of flowers.\nBees also use chemicals to signal outside the hive. When a worker stings something, her stinger releases an alarm pheromone that causes other bees to become agitated, and helps them locate the enemy.\nThought it's always dark in the hive, vision is important to honeybees outside. They can see other animals, and recognize flowers. The eyes of Apis species can detect ultraviolet light wavelengths that are beyond the visible spectrum. This allows them to locate the sun on cloudy days, and see markings on flowers that are only visible in ultraviolet light. One portion of honeybee's eyes  is sensitive to polarized light, and they use this to navigate.\nWorkers and queens can hear vibrations. New queens call to each other and workers when they first emerge. Workers hear the vibrations of the waggle dances made by returning foragers.\nApis species have a particularly notable form of communication called \"dancing.\" Foragers that have located an abundant supply of food do a dance to communicate the location of the patch to other foragers. A \"round dance\" indicates food within about 300 meters of the hive, and only communicates the presence of the flowers, not the direction, though workers will also get the scent from the food the forager has brought back. The more complicated \"waggle dance\" indicates the direction and distance of food further away, using the location of the sun and the bee's memory of the distance it flew to return to the hive. Symbolic communication is quite unusual among invertebrates, and these honeybee \"dances\" have been intensively studied.  (Breed, et al., 1985; Milne and Milne, 2000; Reinhard, et al., 2004; Roat and Landim, 2008; Sammataro and Avitabile, 1998; Sandoz, et al., 2002; Sherman and Visscher, 2002)\nApis mellifera feed on pollen and nectar collected from blooming flowers. They also eat honey (stored, concentrated nectar) and secretions produced by other members of their colony.\nWorkers forage for food (nectar and pollen) for the entire colony. They use their tongues to suck up nectar, and store it in the anterior section of the digestive tract, called the crop. They collect pollen by grooming it off the bodies and onto special structures on their hind legs called pollen baskets.\nReturning foragers transfer the nectar they have collected to younger worker bees that in turn feed other members of the hive, or process it into honey for long-term storage. They add enzymes to the honey, and store it in open cells where the water can evaporate, concentrating the sugars.\nYoung workers eat pollen and nectar, and secrete food materials, called \u201croyal jelly\u201d and \u201cworker jelly\u201d, from glands in their heads. This material is fed to young larvae, and the amount and type they get determines if they will be queens or workers.\nHoneybees forage during daylight hours, but are equally active on cloudy or sunny days. They will not fly in heavy rain or high winds, or if the temperature is too extreme (workers can't fly when they get below 10\u00b0C). During the warm, calm weather the honeybees collect the most pollen even if it is cloudy. If the light intensity changes rapidly, they immediately stop working and return to the hive. If it lightly rains, pollen collection stops, because moisture inhibits the bee\u2019s ability to collect it. However, nectar collection is not inhibited by light rain. Wind also affects the rate of pollen collection.\nHoneybee workers are opportunistic. They will steal from other hives if they can. Hive-robbing can be dangerous, but a weakened or damaged hive may be raided by workers from other hives, especially when nectar flows in flowers are not abundant. Honeybees will also collect \u201choneydew,\u201d the sweet fluid excreted by sap-feeding insects like aphids.  (Adjare, 1990; Gonzalez, et al., 1995; Percival, 1947; Sammataro and Avitabile, 1998)\nHoneybees have many adaptations for defense:\nAdults have orange and black striping that acts as warning coloration. Predators can learn to associate that pattern with a painful sting, and avoid them.\nHoneybees prefer to build their hives in protected cavities (small caves or tree hollows). They seal small openings with a mix of wax and resins called propolis, leaving only one small opening.\nWorker bees guard the entrance of the hive. They are able to recognize members of their colony by scent, and will attack any non-members that try to enter the hive. \nWorkers and queens have a venomous sting at the end of the abdomen. Unlike queens, and unusual among stinging insects, the stings of Apis workers are heavily barbed and the sting and venom glands tear out of the abdomen, remaining embedded in the target. This causes the death of the worker, but may also cause a more painful sting, and discourage the predator from attacking other bees or the hive.\nA stinging worker releases an alarm pheromone which causes other workers to become agitated and more likely to sting, and signals the location of the first sting.\nHoneybees are subject to many types of predators, some attacking the bees themselves, others consuming the wax and stored food in the hive. Some predators are specialists on bees, including honeybees.\nImportant invertebrate enemies of adult bees include crab spiders and orb-weaver spiders, wasps in the genus Philanthus (called \u201cbeewolves\u201d), and many species of social wasps in the family Vespidae. Vespid wasp colonies are known to attack honeybee colonies en masse, and can wipe out a hive in one attack. Many vertebrate insectivores also eat adult honeybees. Toads (Bufo) that can reach the entrance of hive will sit and eat many workers, as will opossums (Didelphis). Birds are an important threat \u2013 the Meropidae (bee-eaters) in particular in Africa and southern Europe, but also flycatchers around the world (Tyrranidae and Muscicapidae). Apis mellifera in Africa are also subject to attack by honeyguides. These birds eat hive comb, consuming bees, wax, and stored honey. At least one species, the greater honeyguide (Indicator indicator) will guide mammal hive predators to hives, and then feed on the hive after the mammal has opened it up.\nThe main vertebrate predators of hives are mammals. Bears frequently attack the nests of social bees and wasps, as do many mustelids such as the tayra in the Neotropics and especially the honey badger of Africa and southern and western Asia. In the Western Hemisphere skunks, armadillos and anteaters also raid hives, as do pangolins (Manis) in Africa. Large primates, including baboons, chimpanzees (<<g.Pan>>) and gorillas are reported to attack hives too. Smaller mammals such as mice (Mus) and rats (Rattus) will burrow into hives as well.\nSome insects are predators in hives as well, including wax moth larvae (Galleria mellonella, Achroia grisella), and hive beetles (Hylostoma, Aethina), and some species of ants. In their native regions these tend not to be important enemies, but where honeybees have not co-evolved with these insects and have no defense, they can do great harm to hives.\nSee Ecosystem Roles section for information on honeybee parasites and pathogens.  (Adjare, 1990; Roubik, 1989; Sammataro and Avitabile, 1998)\nHoneybees are very important pollinators, and are the primary pollinator for many plants. Without honeybees, these plants have greatly reduced fertility. In North America and Australia, where there are no native bee species with large colonies, honeybees can have especially strong effects on native flowers, and on other pollinators such as solitary bee species. Honeybees ability to recruit fellow workers by \u201cdancing\u201d allows them to be more efficient than other pollinators at exploiting patches of flowers. This can create strong impacts on their competitors, especially solitary bees.\nLike all social insects, honeybees are hosts to a variety of parasites, commensal organisms, and pathogenic microbes. Some of these can be serious problems for apiculture, and have been studied intensively. At least 18 types of viruses have been found to cause disease in bees, including Sacbrood disease. Several of them (but not sacbrood virus) are associated with parasitic mites. Bacteria infect bees, notably Bacillus larvae, agent of American Foulbrood disease, and Melissococcus pluton, agent of European Foulbrood. Fungi grow in bee hives, and Ascosphaera apis can cause Chalkbrood disease. One of the most common diseases in domesticated hives is Nosema disease, caused by a protozoan, Nosema apis. An amoeba, Malphigamoeba mellificae, also causes disease in honeybees.\nIn recent decades, two mite species have spread through domesticated and feral honeybee populations around the world. Acarapis woodi is a small mite species that lives in the tracheae of adult bees and feeds on bee hemolymph. It was first discovered in Europe, but its origin is unknown. Infestations of these mites weaken bees, and in cold climates, whole colonies may fail when the bees are confined in the hive during the winter. A much worse threat is Varroa destructor. This might evolved on an Asian honeybee, Apis cerana, but switched on to Apis mellifera colonies that were set up in east Asia. It has since spread all around the world, except Australia. Juvenile mites feed on bee larvae and pupae, and adult female mites feed and disperse on adult workers. This mite is known to spread several viruses as well. Infestations of V. destructor often wipe out colonies. Nearly all the feral, untended honeybee colonies in North American are believed to have been wiped out by mite infestations, along with a large proportion of domesticated colonies. Other mite species are known from honeybee colonies, but they are not considered harmful.\nAnother commensal or parasitic species is Braula coeca, the bee louse. Despite the common name, this is actually a wingless fly, that apparently feeds by intercepting food being transferred from one bee to another.\nBeetles in the genera Hylostoma and Aethina are found in African honeybee nests, where they seem to do little harm. However, the \"small hive beetle\", Aethina tumida, has become a significant problem in European and North American hives. The larvae eat all the contents of comb: honey, pollen, and bee eggs and larvae.  (Adjare, 1990; Roubik, 1989; Sammataro and Avitabile, 1998)\nHoneybees pollinate billions of US dollars worth of commercial agricultural crops around the world every year. They are important pollinators for economically important wild plant populations as well.\nHoneybee hives provide honey and wax, and pollen, propolis, and royal jelly that are sold for medicines and cosmetics.\nHoneybees are important study organisms for research in the connections between nervous system structure and behavior.\nSome research suggests honeybee venom may have medically useful applications in the treatment of auto-immune disease or inflammation.  (Adjare, 1990; Kang, et al., 2002; Sammataro and Avitabile, 1998)\nHoneybee workers will sting humans and domesticated animals in defense of themselves or their hive. A single sting is painful but not dangerous unless the target is allergic to the venom, in which case it can be life threatening. Otherwise, it takes about 20 stings per kilogram of body weight to be life threatening.\nEach subspecies of Apis mellifera has different behavioral patterns in regards to intruders near or around the hive. The African  subspecies are particularly aggressive. One of them, Apis mellifera scutellata, was accidentally released in South America, and has spread north to the southern United States. This is the \"killer bee.\" It is notable for having a much higher aggressive response to disturbance -- more workers attack than in other subspecies, and they pursue targets much longer than European bees do. The spread of these bees made beekeeping much more expensive and complicated, and the aggressive bees caused many deaths.  (Adjare, 1990; Sammataro and Avitabile, 1998)\nWhile the species as a whole is still very numerous, there is concern in Europe that widespread commercialization of beekeeping is endangering locally-adapted populations and subspecies. This, combined with higher mortality of colonies due to Varroa mite and tracheal mite infestations, and the recent phenomenon of Colony Collapse Disorder in North America, has cause significant concern for the health of the population. Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) is a condition of commercial beehives, where there are sudden massive waves of mortality among the workers. Beekeepers discover their hives simply empty of workers, with so few surviving that they cannot tend the queen and brood. This condition has occurred mainly in North America, and mainly in large commercial apiaries. No single cause has been identified yet.

Cicada killers are large, solitary wasps in the family Crabronidae. The name may be applied to any species of crabronid which uses cicadas as prey, though in North America it is typically applied to a single species, S. speciosus. However, since there are multiple species of related wasps, it is more appropriate to call it the eastern cicada killer. This species occurs in the eastern and midwest U.S. and southwards into Mexico and Central America. They are so named because they hunt cicadas and provision their nests with them. In North America they are sometimes called sand hornets, although they are not hornets, which belong to the family Vespidae. Cicada killers exert a measure of natural control on cicada populations and thus may directly benefit the deciduous trees upon which their cicada prey feed.\nThe most recent review of this species' biology is found in the posthumously published comprehensive study by noted entomologist Howard Ensign Evans.[1]\n\n\nAdult eastern cicada killer wasps are large, 1.5 to 5.0 centimetres (0.6 to 2.0\u00a0in) long, robust wasps with hairy, reddish and black areas on the thorax (middle part), and are black to reddish brown marked with light yellow stripes on the abdominal (rear) segments. The wings are brownish. Coloration superficially resembles that of some yellowjacket and hornet species. The females are somewhat larger than the males, and both are among the largest wasps seen in the Eastern United States, their unusual size giving them a uniquely fearsome appearance. European hornets (Vespa crabro) are often mistaken for Eastern cicada killers.\nSolitary wasps (such as the eastern cicada killer) are very different in their behavior from the social wasps such as hornets, yellowjackets, and paper wasps. Cicada killer females use their sting to paralyze their prey (cicadas) rather than to defend their nests; unlike most social wasps and bees, they do not attempt to sting unless handled roughly. Adults feed on flower nectar and other plant sap exudates.\nAdults emerge in summer, typically beginning around late June or early July and die off in September or October. They are present in a given area for 60 to 75 days, usually until mid-September. The large females are commonly seen skimming around lawns seeking good sites to dig burrows and searching for cicadas in trees and taller shrubs.\nThe males are more often seen in groups, vigorously challenging one another for position on the breeding aggregation from which they emerged, and generally investigate anything that moves or flies near them. It is not unusual to see two or three male wasps locked together in apparent midair combat, the aggregate adopting an erratic flight path until one of the wasps breaks away. The male wasp's aggressive behavior is similar to that of another robust insect of the area, the male carpenter bee. In both cases, while the males' vigorous territorial defense can be frightening and intimidating to human passersby, the males pose no danger whatsoever. They will only grapple with other insects, and cannot sting.\nThis ground-burrowing wasp may be found in well-drained, sandy soils to loose clay in bare or grass-covered banks, berms and hills as well as next to raised sidewalks, driveways and patio slabs. Females may share a burrow, digging their own nest cells off the main tunnel. A typical burrow is 25\u201350 centimetres (10\u201320\u00a0in) deep and about 1.5\u00a0cm (0.59\u00a0in) wide. In digging a burrow, the female dislodges the soil with her jaws and, using her hind legs, pushes loose soil behind her as she backs out of the burrow. Her hind legs are equipped with special spines that help her push the dirt behind her. The excess soil pushed out of the burrow forms a mound with a trench through it at the burrow entrance. Cicada killers may nest in planters, window boxes, flower beds or under shrubs, ground cover, etc. Nests often are made in the full sun where vegetation is sparse.\nAfter digging a nest chamber in the burrow, female cicada killers capture cicadas, paralyzing them with a sting. After paralyzing a cicada, the female wasp holds it upside down beneath her and takes off toward her burrow; this return flight to the burrow is difficult for the wasp because the cicada is often more than twice her weight. After putting one or more cicadas in her nest cell, the female deposits an egg on a cicada and closes the cell with dirt. Male eggs are laid on a single cicada but female eggs are given two or sometimes three cicadas; this is because the female wasp is twice as large as the male and must have more food. New nest cells are dug as necessary off of the main burrow tunnel and a single burrow may eventually have 10 or more nest cells. The egg hatches in one or two days, and the cicadas serve as food for the grub. The larvae complete their development in about 2 weeks. Overwintering occurs as a mature larva within an earth-coated cocoon. Pupation occurs in the nest cell in the spring and lasts 25 to 30 days. There is only one generation per year and no adults overwinter.\nThis wasp is frequently attacked by the parasitic \"velvet ant\" wasp, Dasymutilla occidentalis, also known as the \"cow-killer\" wasp. It lays an egg in the nest cell of the cicada killer, and when the cicada killer larva pupates, the parasitoid larva consumes the pupa.\nAlthough cicada killers are large, female cicada killer wasps are not aggressive and rarely sting unless they are grasped roughly, stepped upon with bare feet, or caught in clothing, etc. One author who has been stung indicates that, for him, the stings are not much more than a \"pinprick\".[2] Males aggressively defend their perching areas on nesting sites against rival males but they have no sting. Although they appear to attack anything that moves near their territories, male cicada killers are actually investigating anything that might be a female cicada killer ready to mate. Such close inspection appears to many people to be an attack, but male and female cicada killers do not land on people and attempt to sting. If handled roughly, females will sting, and males will jab with a sharp spine on the tip of their abdomen. Both sexes are well equipped to bite, as they have large jaws; however, they do not appear to grasp human skin and bite. They are generally non-aggressive towards humans and usually fly away when swatted at, instead of attacking.[citation needed]\nThe North American cicada killer wasps all belong to the genus Sphecius, of which there are 21 species worldwide. The remaining three cicada-killing species in the genus in North America are:\nIt is suspected that the western cicada killer represents more than one species. There is also evidence to suggest that the eastern cicada killer has either a subspecies or a closely related species that mimics the Pacific cicada killer. Alternatively, when they were already distinct species, significant hybridization has occurred between them, though not enough to fully overcome their present reproductive isolation.[3]\nThe spectacled cicada killer, Sphecius spectabilis (Taschenberg, 1875), is found in the South American countries of Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, French Guiana, Paraguay, Surinam and Venezuela.\nSixteen other cicada killer wasp species in the genus Sphecius are found in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia. There are also other genera of cicada-killing wasps (e.g., Liogorytes in South America and Exeirus in Australia) which are the \"cicada killers\" of their native lands.\nThe original version of this heavily edited article was a copy of a fact sheet from the Ohio State University Extension."], ["Cicada Killer Wasps | University of Kentucky Entomology", "http://www2.ca.uky.edu/entomology/entfacts/ef004.asp", "\u00a0\nMild mannered female cicada  killer wasps are active across Kentucky  during the summer, intent on their tasks of 1) digging underground burrows and  2) provisioning them with paralyzed cicadas that will be food for their  grub-like larvae. The wasps will be very focused on these tasks for several  weeks.\n\u00a0\nWhy are cicada killers so  abundant in some areas? These solitary wasps choose sites with specific  characteristics: well-drained, light-textured soils in full sunlight that are  near trees harboring cicadas. They may dig along sidewalk or patio edges, in flower  beds, gardens, or lawns. As much as 100 cubic inches of soil may be brought to  the surface as tunnels are formed. This can be unsightly in highly managed turf  and the accumulations may smother grass. Sometimes skunks may dig up areas that  have been extensively tunneled by the wasps to feed on cicadas and wasp larvae.\n\u00a0\nLarge  aggregations of cicada killers can build up over time. An estimated 40% of the  developing larvae (a dozen or more per tunnel) may emerge as adults the  following year so numbers can increase rapidly.\n\u00a0\nAre cicada killers  dangerous? Females have significant stingers which they plunge into cicadas to inject venom  that paralyzes them. Without doubt, their stings are painful. However, they are  not aggressive and do not have nest-guarding instinct of honey bees and hornets.  You can walk through areas where they are active without attracting attention. \n\u00a0\nThe  buzzing noise that the wasps make and the warning colors on their wings and bodies  intimidate and discourage predators that see them as a large meal. When  attacked, females will use their stinger to protect themselves.\n\u00a0\nMales  lack stingers but are territorial. They will approach anything that enters  \u201ctheir area\u201d, including walkers, people mowing or using weed-eaters, or riding  tractors. They may hover and challenge trespassers but are harmless. That can  be easy to forget when staring down a big wasp.\n\u00a0\nWill cicada killers harm  pets? Some  dogs and cats may catch cicada killers but usually only once. Those that pick  females probably will be stung, remember it, and associate the experience with  the buzzing sound and warning colors. Some may have a severe reaction to the  venom, especially if stung in the mouth.\u00a0  If that is suspected, the animal should be taken to a veterinarian  immediately. Wasp flight begins in early morning and can continue until dusk.  Wasps remain in their burrows at night so encounters can be avoided by managing  the activity of the pet.\n\u00a0\nCan cicada killers cause  damage?\nFemale  cicada killers dig extensive tunnels where their young will be raised,  displacing several pounds of soil in the process. Occasionally, it can result  in some damage, such destabilizing a brick patio laid on sand. This is an  instance when control may be needed.\n\u00a0\nCicada  killers may dig in the loose soil in vegetable gardens or flower beds. A burrow  at the base of a plant may disrupt its root system. If only a few plants are  affected, drenching the area around their bases with water is probably the best  approach. The wasps do not like wet soil so they may abandon the site. Watering  the plants thoroughly will settle soil back around the roots giving them a  chance to survive. Do not drench soil around plants with an insecticide mix  because it may damage the roots and/or result in a residue in the plant. \n\u00a0\nCicada  killers may begin to dig in sandy areas on playgrounds or in golf course sand  traps. If practical, keep these areas wet or regularly churn the sand to  discourage wasps from establishing their tunnels. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCan cicada killer wasps be  controlled?\r\nControl  may be desirable in situations where physical damage is occurring or the  presence of the insects is causing significant distress.\u00a0 The wasps were controlled in a West Virginia study by  sprays of the pyrerthroid insecticides (cyfluthrin or cyhalothrin).\u00a0 Applications were made directly into the  burrows or only to the entrances where the wasps contacted the insecticides as  they entered and left.\u00a0 Broadcast sprays  over the area where cicada killers were nesting were not effective in reducing  their numbers.\n\u00a0\nWill cicada killers every  go away? These wasps will stay and thrive where their basic needs are met. Even if  aggressive control measures kill the inhabitants, the site will remain  attractive to new settlers in ensuing years. \n\u00a0\nWhat are the tunnels like?\n\u00a0\nRevised: 7/12  \n\u00a0\nCAUTION!

Many people are afraid of wasps in general and really large wasps like cicada-killers can be very threatening when breeding, digging and nesting on one\u2019s property. Although it is extremely unlikely that a cicada-killer will land on you and sting, they do fly close to people and pets when they venture near their breeding areas and this can be frightening. Thus, many people want to rid their properties of cicada-killers. \nI have had many e-mails from people who say that they are at their wit\u2019s end because they have paid exterminators lots of money to rid them of cicada-killers and, yet, the wasps keep returning year after year. This occurs because of the way the wasp breeds: They do not have large nests like yellowjackets and hornets, but dig their solitary burrows over a wide area, lay their eggs in individual nest cells in the burrows and then move on to another suitable area. Thus, there is no single nest for each female and her offspring to defend, as there is with yellow jackets, hornets and bees, and there is no single source of new females which will dig next year\u2019s burrows. Unfortunately, this also means that exterminating all of the wasps on a given property in the middle of the summer cannot keep them from \u201cseeding in\u201d from other properties in the neighborhood later in the summer or again in the following summer. \nEach year female cicada-killers hatch in July and August, mate and then search for suitable places to dig their burrows. So, if you spray for wasps this year, you will kill only those which visit your property after it has been sprayed. Next summer, females will hatch in your general area and, because your property is attractive to them (probably southern-facing, well-drained and with large trees nearby), they will dig burrows and reinfest your yard. In addition, if you spray after burrows have been dug on your property, the eggs which have already been laid in them will not be killed and will hatch next year. When male cicada killers emerge each July, they stay where they hatch (your yard) and fight each other and fly around looking for females; the females emerge in late July and early August, mate and then search for suitable places to dig their nesting burrows. These are behaviors which bother many people because the males appear aggressive when they fly close to them and the females are very persistent in searching a lawn for good nesting sites. Unfortunately, many exterminators do not tell their customers that this will happen year after year and, thus, will require regular reapplication of pesticides. \nThere is a new cicada killer trap on the market that uses no pesticides. The manufacturer says, \u201cThe cicada wasp trap is a unique method of eliminating infestations of cicada wasps using a pet-friendly, non toxic glue. Traps are simply placed over an active cicada wasp burrow after dusk, when the wasps are resting in their burrows. In the morning, the wasps emerge from their burrows into the glue trap and can be properly disposed of.\u201d Click on this link if you are interested: cicada killer traps.\nIf you are determined to use pesticides, you should read the excellent circular published by the Agricultural and Forestry Experiment Station of West Virginia University; email them and ask for circular #161. It presents the results of experiments to determine the best way to eliminate cicada-killers from a golf course which had nearly 1000 burrows. They found that spraying the insecticides Triumph (isazophos), Tempo (cyfluthrin), Karate (cyhalothrin), Dursban (chlorpyrifos) and Baygon (propoxur) into the burrows at the rate of 1-2 ounces of mixed liquid per burrow eliminated all burrowing activity by the wasps three days after application. Spraying the same insecticides over an area to control cicada-killers was less effective. The author notes that the golf course must be sprayed every year to control cicada-killers because it is ideal habitat and attracts the wasps every year. Bugspray.com has a page on cicada-killer control and sells pesticides and spraying equipment to apply them. \nI believe that you are in more danger from pesticides applied to your lawn to kill cicada-killers than from the wasps. People often feel that the wasps deny them the use of their yards, but they should also be aware that many pesticides also temporarily deny them the use of the area which is sprayed, particuarly so for children and pets. This, of course, is the same area that the wasps deny them the use of.  \nHere is what I say to those who ask me how to deal with cicada killers on their properties (revised August 25, 2012): \n1) You can swat and kill the wasps very easily with a badminton racquet if you swing it hard. Don\u2019t use a tennis racquet unless you play tennis regularly, as it will quickly give you tennis elbow and it is hard to accelerate quickly compared to the much lighter badminton racquet. You may, if you like, call this aerobic exercise. Most of the wasps you see in July are males and they can\u2019t sting because they use what would be the stinger for sex. Just ten males flying around waiting for the females to hatch and mate can look like 50 \u2013 wade into them swinging the racquet and you\u2019ll quickly reduce their numbers. The same is true for female wasps. I have caught, tagged and released over 2000 cicada killers, and never has one tried to land on me and sting. In some wasp species, male wasps swarming in a given area attract females which then dig their burrows in that area; the same may be true for cicada killers, so killing off the swarming males may well make your yard less attractive to nesting female cicada killers looking for a good place to make their solitary nests.\n2) Every day at about 9 am, plug the wasps\u2019 burrows with a short length of stick, stomp it level with the ground and brush away the piles of dirt next to them. The female wasps use the dirt piles to help them locate their burrow each time they return to it after hunting a new cicada for a new nest cell, so you\u2019ll make things difficult for them by removing the dirt. The dirt piles also attract new females to the area and they will look for places nearby to dig their own burrows, so, if you remove them daily, you\u2019ll have fewer new burrows dug on your property.\n3) Once you have blocked the burrows and removed the dirt next to them, look at them again 30-45 minutes later \u2013 some of them will have wasps trying to dig back into them after they have returned from hunting cicadas. Kill them with the edge of the racquet or by stepping on them with your shoe (don\u2019t do this barefoot or in zoris, or you\u2019ll be sorry).\nThis summer (2012) I have used these methods above (kill all available wasps with a badminton racquet, plug the burrows with a piece of stick, remove the pile of dirt next to each one and kill all wasps that return to the blocked burrows 30-45 minutes later) on three yards in Easton, PA that have had regular infestations of 50-100 cicada killer burrows each year for the last 3-5 years. At each property I killed over 100 males this July and over 150 females in July and August; this took me a total of about two hours a day from 9 \u2013 11 am for all three properties. At no time were there more than 10 new burrows present on any given morning and the lawns were only minimally disturbed. Best of all, no insecticides were used. If you are persistent, this method works. If you are not persistent and let it go for several days, then each wasp will make several nest cells with cicada-provisioned eggs in them in each burrow each day. These eggs will turn into wasp grubs, eat their cicadas, make cocoons and hatch out next summer to annoy you again.\nThe alternative is to remove each burrow\u2019s pile of dirt daily and then blow powdered or liquid insecticide into each burrow from which you have just removed a dirt pile. This method insures that you are spraying only active burrows \u2013 those with fresh dirt next to them. Be certain not to breathe the insecticide powder or mist as you are using it, don\u2019t get it on yourself or the grass around the burrow and don\u2019t let children or pets use the area for the recommended length of time after applying the insecticide.\nGood luck!\nThe following are suggested methods of dealing with cicada-killer infestations offered to Prof. Joe Coelho by readers of his \u201cCicada Killer Thriller Page\u201d. Neither he nor I have tested them, but their inventors claim success with them. Again, good luck! \nMethod 1: \nWe\u2019ve recently had a cicada killer explosion in my native northern Alabama. It started last summer with a good-sized infestation next to my utility shed. I\u2019d never seen these gigantic wasps in my entire life, so I assumed it was a fluke from the mild winter we had the previous year and paid it no mind. However, they came back in force this summer, digging more nests than ever before. No one in this area knows how to deal with them, so when I went to call around for an exterminator, I was out of luck. No one wanted to touch them, despite the males having false stingers. However, when I talked to my father about it, he had a solution that had been passed down from his great-grandmother. It\u2019s all-natural, involves no pesticides, and has worked for me every single time. At dusk, after the cicada killers go to sleep, boil a big pot of water \u2014 get it really boiling, now \u2014 go outside, and pour it into the nest. Later on, when you cut the grass, mulch over the bare patches of soil and the holes with the clippings so they won\u2019t come back. Using this tactic, I have wiped out entire infestations in less than 24 hours, and they haven\u2019t returned. Meg \nMethod 2: \nHello Joe: I was surfing the web for help in getting rid of cicada killers and I came across your web site.I have had about 10-20 wasps in my back yard (where my pool was). In the last 2 weeks, I have been desparately trying ways to get rid of them (short of playing tennis with them). Raid was too expensive. I thought of \u201cHot Shot\u201d Spray starting fluid (inexpensive but explosive \u2026 didn\u2019t want to mess with that). Then a friend suggested this and I tried it and it seems to be working \u2013 at least they are leaving my yard. In an old dish wash soap bottle (squeeze type) I\u2019ve been mixing salad dressing (1/2 of the bottle of oil, the remaining half vinegar) equal amounts of each to fill the old soap container. I used the cheapest oil and vinegar I could find in the supermarket. \nI mixed and shook, waited for a wasp to enter a hole, then squirted the mixture into the hole after it. I also looked for all of the other holes and randomly just filled them with the mix. Apparently, the vinegar helps the mix to run down into the hole, and the oil coats it, so as to frustrate the wasp. It works and I\u2019m not questioning it. The wasps are leaving and soon I can sit on my deck again. Thanks.

Note that I have netted them, put them in vials, dug up their burrows, grabbed them with pliers, and performed other unspeakable acts upon them with impunity.  Most people are not interested in becoming that intimate with them.  Unless you step barefoot on a female or grab her with bare hands, you are extremely unlikely to be stung.  With just a little awareness, you should easily avoid being stung.  \r\n\r\nI had to grab one and hold it to my arm to be stung.\u00a0 It felt like the tiniest pin prick.\u00a0 A \u00bc\"-diameter painless white bump surrounded by a 1\"-diameter red spot developed, but they went away within an hour.\u00a0 I have repeated this many times, and it's always the same.  A graduate student volunteer had the exact same experience.  I suspect that the few reported painful cicada killer stings were actually delivered by European hornets, which they resemble, or other mimics; see above.) In spite of their large size, loud buzz and bright coloration, cicada killers are wimps.\u00a0 These effects are all part of their big bluff.\u00a0 If they sting you, they call their own bluff, so they avoid it as much as possible.  I've tried to get them to bite me, too,  but their mandibles cannot get a grip on my skin.\r\n\r\nOne caveat:  for a susceptible (allergic) individual, a single hymenopteran sting may cause serious illness or death from shock.

Cicada killers only inhabit disturbed environments.  Since humans have provided so much more habitat for them, there are probably more cicada killers now than ever before (though I'm not sure about the western species).  Killing off a few will not drive the the species to extinction.  Although I have argued that it's best to leave them alone, you needn't feel guilty about it if you have decided to get rid of your backyard population.\r\n\r\nOK, muggles, if you've read this far and still want to kill these animals, I have a few suggestions.  First, let me say that all the methods I know for killing cicada killers are here.  I will no longer answer emails from those asking for my supposed \"secret\" method. \u00a0  If you're worried about having to consult annuity calculators to figure out if you can afford certain chemicals, the cheapest and most natural and organic method would be to whack them--literally.\u00a0 Obtain a cheap tennis or badminton racket and swing away.\u00a0 Remember, there are always fewer than there appear to be.\u00a0 You'll be surprised at how rapidly your infestation becomes depleted.  It takes some coordination, however.  Modifications to this method include using a plastic baseball bat or a Racquet Zapper (electrified racquet).  Other recent suggestions are to push them to the ground with a jet of water (set at about a 1\" diameter) from a hose or a blast of air from a leaf blower and stomp them.  A new trick is to leave a dead female on the ground, then kill the males that come over to check her out.\r\n\r\nThe only published method of chemical control involves spraying pyrethroids down into the burrow entrance.\u00a0 This will kill the female, but not necessarily all her offspring because they are walled off in little chambers underground.\u00a0 To prevent an infestation in the following year, you'd have to spray the burrow early on, before many prey have been sequestered.\u00a0 You could probably also spray males while they are perching if you use one of those jet-squirting cans of \"wasp and hornet killer,\" which are usually composed of pyrethroids.  Several alert readers have informed me that such sprays have no effect, but one reports that starter fluid (available at automotive supply stores everywhere) is highly effective.  Warning: starter fluid is highly flammable and will kill your grass on contact.  One alert reader claims success in killing flying adult cicada killers with Sysco (the nationwide quality food purveyors) Institutional Contact Insecticide, which produces a fog.  The active ingredients are Pyrethrins, 0.04%;  Piperonyl Butoxide, 2.00%.  Sysco products are generally available to restaurants.  Similar products are probably available from other insecticide manufacturers.  \r\n\r\nIf your yard is infested and you want to stop them from nesting, there are few published remedies.  I have some suggestions based on experience and science.  Cicada killers inhabit disturbed environments; they require bare soil or very short grass in order to nest.  Since we humans often have homes and yards, these conditions are common.  In fact, there are probably more eastern cicada killers than ever because of the presence of modern human cultural practices.  It should be possible to prevent their nesting by planting dense, tall vegetation. An excellent idea would be to plant a prairie.  Or you could try mowing your lawn on the highest setting during the nesting period.  In flower beds, try using a thick layer of wood chip mulch (that seems to have put them off of one of my field sites, but some respondents report that it does not work).  One pest control professional mentions that a ground cotton hull mulch will stop the nesting.  Cicada killers do not nest in hydric soils.  Although wasting water is a crime, irrigate the infested area heavily (another good study site was destroyed this way, but, again, respondents' results have differed).  \r\nMany old remedies are variations of the following: wait until dark and pour boiling water down the burrow.  Substitutde various other substances for boiling water, and you get most of the variations, some of which are downright dangerous (flammable organic liquids).  Even boiling water is not without hazard: avoid spilling it on yourself!  This method should kill the female, her larvae and pupae.  Diatomaceous earth can be a cheap and otherwise harmless insecticide.  I think sprinkling it down the burrow would ultimately kill the female (by dehydration). Borax should act similarly, but it is NOT harmless.  I'm told it's toxic to plants.  \r\n\r\nThe following method was kindly submitted by alert reader Bill Nilsen: \"I work for a company that does landscape maintenance for condominium associations, apartment complexes, H.O.A.'s, etc.  We occasionally get requests to control cicada killers.  I try to discourage it, but sometimes people insist on having it done.  One technique I read about many years ago and tried seemed to work.  However, it is rather labor intensive and, therefore, costly if you hire someone to do it.  Because of the cost, I have only been requested to do it a couple of times during years when the populations seemed to boom.  In the evening, after the cicada killers stop flying, you would sprinkle an insecticide in a dust formulation around the areas where the holes are.  You would then cover the area with a sheet of clear plastic.  In the morning the cicada killers would come out & try to fly around. In the process, they would cover themselves with the dust.  You had to make sure you took the plastic off before it got too hot & killed the grass.  Although, after reading your article, it seems I was just killing the females.  But since the females were no longer available, maybe the males left for better breeding grounds.\"  I'm guessing the edges of the plastic would be weighted or held down somehow to prevent the wasps from escaping.\r\nThe following method was kindly submitted by alert reader Brian Gwynne: \"I have a labor intensive solution to suggest.  In the early stages of emergence when the wasps are still young I staked out the burrowing areas with a can of SpectracidePRO Wasp and Hornet Killer in my hand, stalking them like a Navy Seal.  Made for Spectrum Group, a division of United Industries Corp. (800-917-5438) SpectracidePRO has Tetramethrin (0.10%), Permethrin (0.25%), Pipernyl Butoxide (0.50%) and various carriers including petroleum distillates.  ... A slight dusting doesn't seem to do much so you really have to dose the ones you hit.  Knock them down with a decent hit then soak 'em.  It killed the grass, true, but since this year the wasps decided to nest under and around our deck it was only a little grass and inconspicuous at that.  After five days of stalking, spraying then leaving the area to let them emerge and gather again and repeating the process, I went through 8 cans at $3.95 per can. I wasted a lot of the stuff at first but my aim and anticipation of their flight patterns improved over time.  I found that just before dusk, as the temperature has just started to dip and on very slightly breezy days when the wasps have a slight air current to fight, which slows them down and makes them occasionally fly in a stationary back and forth movement (sitting ducks) were the best times to launch the ambush.\r\n \r\n...So for about a $30.00 investment there are only 3 or 4 of the buggers left....  \r\n \r\nI counted up the dead ones I could still find and they numbered 326.  At roughly $.10 per wasp and a total of about 4 hours of work spread out over a week, I think this tactic was a success for this season.\"\r\n \nSubmitted by Janie:  \"We started seeing these wasps about 15 years ago.  About 10 years ago, my sons were out there swinging their tennis rackets at them and having a grand time.  of course, every year there were more and more nests.   We tried expensive sprays...too difficult and expensive.  a $20 can would last about 1 minute of continuous spraying.  Two years ago, we had hundreds of nests in our back yard.  I'd been doing the ammonia/water down the holes, but they kept multiplying.  \r\nLast year,  I went out to Home Depot and bought \"bird block\" - a netting that people would throw over a bush to keep the birds from it, I guess.  I bought enough to cover our entire yard.  - 7' x 40' rolls I think - for about $20 each.  I bought 5 of them - so there's $100.  The net has openings about 1/2\" square.  I also got a box of gardening staples and a roll of orange ribbon/tape.  \r\nI cut 4\" pieces of the ribbon and tied one to each staple, just so I could see them in the ground.  I covered the whole yard with the net, holding it down with a staple every 4 or 5 feet.  This worked WONDERFULLY!!!  The wasps didn't particularly like going through the net, but some did it anyway.   The neat thing, though, is that even though there were some nests, the wasps couldn't fit the cicadas through the net!  I'd find them lying on top of the net right by the nest!   \r\nDuring the day, I mark any new nests with a white plastic fork.  Then at night - after 10, I go out with a pitcher of 1/2 & 1/2 water and amonia mixture, a funnel, a measuring cup, and a flashlight.  I pour 1 1/2 cups of the mixture down the hole (through the net), then cover dirt over the hole and step on it to seal it shut.  That kills the female, and there are no eggs, because the cicadas are too big to go through the net.   \r\nLast year was the first year I did this.  We had hundreds of wasps and every night, there were about 15 - 20 new holes.  I was using the netting.  This summer, there is a fraction of the number of wasps, and every night I find no more than 5 new holes, and they are usually close to the edges of the net, where the wasp can crawl under the net.  I'm sure that next year, there will be even fewer.\r\nso, yes, this is extreme, but we had given up and were talking about having our whole yard tilled!  We do have 2 small dogs, who don't seem to have any problem walking on the netting.  When my husband or I walk on it, we have to go slowly so we don't trip. - but it's worth it!!\r\nI told my neighbor that if she couldn't cover her whole yard, she should cut 1 ft. square pieces of the net.  then 3 times a day, check her yard for new nests, and when she finds them, to cover the hole with the net and stake it down with 5 or 6 staples so the wasp can't get the cicada to the hole.  Then mark the  hole with the white fork and do the ammonia at night to kill the female.   the next morning, she could remove the net and the staples.\"\nEven with all these suggestions and possible methods, total control of cicada killers can be extremely difficult to achieve.  Many correspondents have reported extreme frustration.  The following testimonial was provided (and reprinted with permission) by Deb Gendron.   \"I've had the giant wasps for about 5 years. They live in my front yard, mostly near the edge of the street. Last year the population of wasps became so large that my friends and relatives stopped coming over. I paid an exterminator to get rid of them and it didn't work. This year the mailman stopped delivering my mail because of the infestation. It was your information that helped me to gain confidence in controlling the population through (unfortunately) eliminating most of them. I must tell you that I spent about $30.00 in RAID, $60.00 in (something like) Diazinon, $45.00 in water and let's not forget the $125.00 for the exterminator. Guess what? It was all a big waste because the only thing that really killed them was to squash them. I figure that for the past 4 weeks the total of wasps that I've killed is at least 100 (way too many to inhabit my tiny 30x100 ft lawn). It is a daily and time-consuming mission. I compare it to trying to get rid of fleas in your carpet with flea powder and a vacuum. It's a one-wasp-at-a-time project. I'm hoping that by next year I'll maybe only have to kill 50 or 60 because I'm sure that some of them have already laid their eggs. I convinced my mailman to deliver my mail today; I'm going to print a copy of the information on your site and give it to him along with a tip from me for braving the wasps. It may sound kind of queer but I wouldn't have had the courage to handle this myself if it wasn't for your article. Thanks, Deb\"  \r\nAnother contributor paid an exterminator, which did not eliminate the wasps, then had to pay thousands to a veterinarian after her dogs got into the sprayed grass. There are now many more resources on the web regarding cicada killers than when I started this one many years ago. Many of them contain unproven or downright incorrect information.  Buyer beware! \r\n\r\nWe have learned of a highly effective way to get rid of cicada-killers in your lawn.  The photo at left shows an area that had several thousand burrows (brown spots) in it last year.  It was covered with six inches of crushed stone this spring (right) and the wasps have not returned.\n\n\nFinally, time is on your side.  If you've tried all these suggestions and cannot get rid of your infestation, take heart.  The wasps don't live very long, so at most you should have them only about two months out of the year. \nOK, muggles, if you've read this far and still want to kill these animals, I have a few suggestions.

Several alert readers have informed me that such sprays have no effect, but one reports that starter fluid (available at automotive supply stores everywhere) is highly effective.  Warning: starter fluid is highly flammable and will kill your grass on contact.  One alert reader claims success in killing flying adult cicada killers with Sysco (the nationwide quality food purveyors) Institutional Contact Insecticide, which produces a fog.  The active ingredients are Pyrethrins, 0.04%;  Piperonyl Butoxide, 2.00%.  Sysco products are generally available to restaurants.  Similar products are probably available from other insecticide manufacturers.  \r\n\r\nIf your yard is infested and you want to stop them from nesting, there are few published remedies.  I have some suggestions based on experience and science.  Cicada killers inhabit disturbed environments; they require bare soil or very short grass in order to nest.  Since we humans often have homes and yards, these conditions are common.  In fact, there are probably more eastern cicada killers than ever because of the presence of modern human cultural practices.  It should be possible to prevent their nesting by planting dense, tall vegetation. An excellent idea would be to plant a prairie.  Or you could try mowing your lawn on the highest setting during the nesting period.  In flower beds, try using a thick layer of wood chip mulch (that seems to have put them off of one of my field sites, but some respondents report that it does not work).  One pest control professional mentions that a ground cotton hull mulch will stop the nesting.  Cicada killers do not nest in hydric soils.  Although wasting water is a crime, irrigate the infested area heavily (another good study site was destroyed this way, but, again, respondents' results have differed).  \r\nMany old remedies are variations of the following: wait until dark and pour boiling water down the burrow.  Substitutde various other substances for boiling water, and you get most of the variations, some of which are downright dangerous (flammable organic liquids).  Even boiling water is not without hazard: avoid spilling it on yourself!  This method should kill the female, her larvae and pupae.  Diatomaceous earth can be a cheap and otherwise harmless insecticide.  I think sprinkling it down the burrow would ultimately kill the female (by dehydration). Borax should act similarly, but it is NOT harmless.  I'm told it's toxic to plants.  \r\n\r\nThe following method was kindly submitted by alert reader Bill Nilsen: \"I work for a company that does landscape maintenance for condominium associations, apartment complexes, H.O.A.'s, etc.  We occasionally get requests to control cicada killers.  I try to discourage it, but sometimes people insist on having it done.  One technique I read about many years ago and tried seemed to work.  However, it is rather labor intensive and, therefore, costly if you hire someone to do it.  Because of the cost, I have only been requested to do it a couple of times during years when the populations seemed to boom.  In the evening, after the cicada killers stop flying, you would sprinkle an insecticide in a dust formulation around the areas where the holes are.  You would then cover the area with a sheet of clear plastic.  In the morning the cicada killers would come out & try to fly around. In the process, they would cover themselves with the dust.  You had to make sure you took the plastic off before it got too hot & killed the grass.  Although, after reading your article, it seems I was just killing the females.  But since the females were no longer available, maybe the males left for better breeding grounds.\"  I'm guessing the edges of the plastic would be weighted or held down somehow to prevent the wasps from escaping.\r\nThe following method was kindly submitted by alert reader Brian Gwynne: \"I have a labor intensive solution to suggest.

A slight dusting doesn't seem to do much so you really have to dose the ones you hit.  Knock them down with a decent hit then soak 'em.

After five days of stalking, spraying then leaving the area to let them emerge and gather again and repeating the process, I went through 8 cans at $3.95 per can. I wasted a lot of the stuff at first but my aim and anticipation of their flight patterns improved over time.  I found that just before dusk, as the temperature has just started to dip and on very slightly breezy days when the wasps have a slight air current to fight, which slows them down and makes them occasionally fly in a stationary back and forth movement (sitting ducks) were the best times to launch the ambush.\r\n \r\n...So for about a $30.00 investment there are only 3 or 4 of the buggers left....  \r\n \r\nI counted up the dead ones I could still find and they numbered 326.

About 10 years ago, my sons were out there swinging their tennis rackets at them and having a grand time.  of course, every year there were more and more nests.   We tried expensive sprays...too difficult and expensive.  a $20 can would last about 1 minute of continuous spraying.  Two years ago, we had hundreds of nests in our back yard.  I'd been doing the ammonia/water down the holes, but they kept multiplying.  \r\nLast year,  I went out to Home Depot and bought \"bird block\" - a netting that people would throw over a bush to keep the birds from it, I guess.  I bought enough to cover our entire yard.  - 7' x 40' rolls I think - for about $20 each.  I bought 5 of them - so there's $100.  The net has openings about 1/2\" square.  I also got a box of gardening staples and a roll of orange ribbon/tape.  \r\nI cut 4\" pieces of the ribbon and tied one to each staple, just so I could see them in the ground.  I covered the whole yard with the net, holding it down with a staple every 4 or 5 feet.  This worked WONDERFULLY!!!  The wasps didn't particularly like going through the net, but some did it anyway.   The neat thing, though, is that even though there were some nests, the wasps couldn't fit the cicadas through the net!  I'd find them lying on top of the net right by the nest!   \r\nDuring the day, I mark any new nests with a white plastic fork.  Then at night - after 10, I go out with a pitcher of 1/2 & 1/2 water and amonia mixture, a funnel, a measuring cup, and a flashlight.  I pour 1 1/2 cups of the mixture down the hole (through the net), then cover dirt over the hole and step on it to seal it shut.  That kills the female, and there are no eggs, because the cicadas are too big to go through the net.   \r\nLast year was the first year I did this.  We had hundreds of wasps and every night, there were about 15 - 20 new holes.  I was using the netting.  This summer, there is a fraction of the number of wasps, and every night I find no more than 5 new holes, and they are usually close to the edges of the net, where the wasp can crawl under the net.  I'm sure that next year, there will be even fewer.\r\nso, yes, this is extreme, but we had given up and were talking about having our whole yard tilled!  We do have 2 small dogs, who don't seem to have any problem walking on the netting.  When my husband or I walk on it, we have to go slowly so we don't trip. - but it's worth it!!\r\nI told my neighbor that if she couldn't cover her whole yard, she should cut 1 ft. square pieces of the net.  then 3 times a day, check her yard for new nests, and when she finds them, to cover the hole with the net and stake it down with 5 or 6 staples so the wasp can't get the cicada to the hole.  Then mark the  hole with the white fork and do the ammonia at night to kill the female.   the next morning, she could remove the net and the staples.\"\nEven with all these suggestions and possible methods, total control of cicada killers can be extremely difficult to achieve.  Many correspondents have reported extreme frustration.  The following testimonial was provided (and reprinted with permission) by Deb Gendron.   \"I've had the giant wasps for about 5 years. They live in my front yard, mostly near the edge of the street. Last year the population of wasps became so large that my friends and relatives stopped coming over. I paid an exterminator to get rid of them and it didn't work. This year the mailman stopped delivering my mail because of the infestation. It was your information that helped me to gain confidence in controlling the population through (unfortunately) eliminating most of them. I must tell you that I spent about $30.00 in RAID, $60.00 in (something like) Diazinon, $45.00 in water and let's not forget the $125.00 for the exterminator. Guess what? It was all a big waste because the only thing that really killed them was to squash them. I figure that for the past 4 weeks the total of wasps that I've killed is at least 100 (way too many to inhabit my tiny 30x100 ft lawn). It is a daily and time-consuming mission. I compare it to trying to get rid of fleas in your carpet with flea powder and a vacuum. It's a one-wasp-at-a-time project. I'm hoping that by next year I'll maybe only have to kill 50 or 60 because I'm sure that some of them have already laid their eggs. I convinced my mailman to deliver my mail today; I'm going to print a copy of the information on your site and give it to him along with a tip from me for braving the wasps.

I must tell you that I spent about $30.00 in RAID, $60.00 in (something like) Diazinon, $45.00 in water and let's not forget the $125.00 for the exterminator. Guess what? It was all a big waste because the only thing that really killed them was to squash them. I figure that for the past 4 weeks the total of wasps that I've killed is at least 100 (way too many to inhabit my tiny 30x100 ft lawn). It is a daily and time-consuming mission. I compare it to trying to get rid of fleas in your carpet with flea powder and a vacuum. It's a one-wasp-at-a-time project. I'm hoping that by next year I'll maybe only have to kill 50 or 60 because I'm sure that some of them have already laid their eggs. I convinced my mailman to deliver my mail today; I'm going to print a copy of the information on your site and give it to him along with a tip from me for braving the wasps.

Thanks, Deb\"  \r\nAnother contributor paid an exterminator, which did not eliminate the wasps, then had to pay thousands to a veterinarian after her dogs got into the sprayed grass. There are now many more resources on the web regarding cicada killers than when I started this one many years ago. Many of them contain unproven or downright incorrect information.  Buyer beware! \r\n\r\nWe have learned of a highly effective way to get rid of cicada-killers in your lawn.  The photo at left shows an area that had several thousand burrows (brown spots) in it last year.  It was covered with six inches of crushed stone this spring (right) and the wasps have not returned.\n\n\nFinally, time is on your side.  If you've tried all these suggestions and cannot get rid of your infestation, take heart.  The wasps don't live very long, so at most you should have them only about two months out of the year. \nMany old remedies are variations of the following: wait until dark and pour boiling water down the burrow.  Substitutde various other substances for boiling water, and you get most of the variations, some of which are downright dangerous (flammable organic liquids).  Even boiling water is not without hazard: avoid spilling it on yourself!  This method should kill the female, her larvae and pupae.  Diatomaceous earth can be a cheap and otherwise harmless insecticide.  I think sprinkling it down the burrow would ultimately kill the female (by dehydration). Borax should act similarly, but it is NOT harmless.  I'm told it's toxic to plants.  \r\n\r\nThe following method was kindly submitted by alert reader Bill Nilsen: \"I work for a company that does landscape maintenance for condominium associations, apartment complexes, H.O.A.'s, etc.  We occasionally get requests to control cicada killers.  I try to discourage it, but sometimes people insist on having it done.  One technique I read about many years ago and tried seemed to work.  However, it is rather labor intensive and, therefore, costly if you hire someone to do it.  Because of the cost, I have only been requested to do it a couple of times during years when the populations seemed to boom.  In the evening, after the cicada killers stop flying, you would sprinkle an insecticide in a dust formulation around the areas where the holes are.  You would then cover the area with a sheet of clear plastic.  In the morning the cicada killers would come out & try to fly around. In the process, they would cover themselves with the dust.  You had to make sure you took the plastic off before it got too hot & killed the grass.  Although, after reading your article, it seems I was just killing the females.  But since the females were no longer available, maybe the males left for better breeding grounds.\"  I'm guessing the edges of the plastic would be weighted or held down somehow to prevent the wasps from escaping.\r\nThe following method was kindly submitted by alert reader Brian Gwynne: \"I have a labor intensive solution to suggest.  In the early stages of emergence when the wasps are still young I staked out the burrowing areas with a can of SpectracidePRO Wasp and Hornet Killer in my hand, stalking them like a Navy Seal.  Made for Spectrum Group, a division of United Industries Corp. (800-917-5438) SpectracidePRO has Tetramethrin (0.10%), Permethrin (0.25%), Pipernyl Butoxide (0.50%) and various carriers including petroleum distillates.  ... A slight dusting doesn't seem to do much so you really have to dose the ones you hit.  Knock them down with a decent hit then soak 'em.  It killed the grass, true, but since this year the wasps decided to nest under and around our deck it was only a little grass and inconspicuous at that.  After five days of stalking, spraying then leaving the area to let them emerge and gather again and repeating the process, I went through 8 cans at $3.95 per can. I wasted a lot of the stuff at first but my aim and anticipation of their flight patterns improved over time.  I found that just before dusk, as the temperature has just started to dip and on very slightly breezy days when the wasps have a slight air current to fight, which slows them down and makes them occasionally fly in a stationary back and forth movement (sitting ducks) were the best times to launch the ambush.\r\n \r\n...So for about a $30.00 investment there are only 3 or 4 of the buggers left....  \r\n \r\nI counted up the dead ones I could still find and they numbered 326.  At roughly $.10 per wasp and a total of about 4 hours of work spread out over a week, I think this tactic was a success for this season.\"\r\n \nSubmitted by Janie:  \"We started seeing these wasps about 15 years ago.  About 10 years ago, my sons were out there swinging their tennis rackets at them and having a grand time.  of course, every year there were more and more nests.   We tried expensive sprays...too difficult and expensive.  a $20 can would last about 1 minute of continuous spraying.  Two years ago, we had hundreds of nests in our back yard.  I'd been doing the ammonia/water down the holes, but they kept multiplying.  \r\nLast year,  I went out to Home Depot and bought \"bird block\" - a netting that people would throw over a bush to keep the birds from it, I guess.  I bought enough to cover our entire yard.  - 7' x 40' rolls I think - for about $20 each.  I bought 5 of them - so there's $100.  The net has openings about 1/2\" square.  I also got a box of gardening staples and a roll of orange ribbon/tape.  \r\nI cut 4\" pieces of the ribbon and tied one to each staple, just so I could see them in the ground.  I covered the whole yard with the net, holding it down with a staple every 4 or 5 feet.  This worked WONDERFULLY!!!  The wasps didn't particularly like going through the net, but some did it anyway.   The neat thing, though, is that even though there were some nests, the wasps couldn't fit the cicadas through the net!  I'd find them lying on top of the net right by the nest!   \r\nDuring the day, I mark any new nests with a white plastic fork.  Then at night - after 10, I go out with a pitcher of 1/2 & 1/2 water and amonia mixture, a funnel, a measuring cup, and a flashlight.  I pour 1 1/2 cups of the mixture down the hole (through the net), then cover dirt over the hole and step on it to seal it shut.  That kills the female, and there are no eggs, because the cicadas are too big to go through the net.   \r\nLast year was the first year I did this.  We had hundreds of wasps and every night, there were about 15 - 20 new holes.  I was using the netting.  This summer, there is a fraction of the number of wasps, and every night I find no more than 5 new holes, and they are usually close to the edges of the net, where the wasp can crawl under the net.  I'm sure that next year, there will be even fewer.\r\nso, yes, this is extreme, but we had given up and were talking about having our whole yard tilled!  We do have 2 small dogs, who don't seem to have any problem walking on the netting.  When my husband or I walk on it, we have to go slowly so we don't trip. - but it's worth it!!\r\nI told my neighbor that if she couldn't cover her whole yard, she should cut 1 ft. square pieces of the net.  then 3 times a day, check her yard for new nests, and when she finds them, to cover the hole with the net and stake it down with 5 or 6 staples so the wasp can't get the cicada to the hole.  Then mark the  hole with the white fork and do the ammonia at night to kill the female.   the next morning, she could remove the net and the staples.\"\nEven with all these suggestions and possible methods, total control of cicada killers can be extremely difficult to achieve.

The cicada killers look very dangerous, but are really gentle giants.  The males buzz around to defend their territory from other males and can be seen charging windows when they see their reflection and think it\u0092s another male. The males have no stinger and can not sting or bite.  Although they may appear aggressive and appear to chase you, they are just investigating every new visitor to their territory.\nThe female cicada killers can be seen digging holes in loose sandy soil where she will lay her eggs.  They prefer open patches in sunny areas with trees nearby. Last year cicada killers set up homes in the front of Suffolk Hall and the ESS steps.  The female cicada killers capture cicada and drag them into their burrow.  The picture to the right shows a cicada killer with a captured cicada.  Female cicada killers can sting, but seldom do.  Unless you step barefoot on a female or grab her with bare hands, you are extremely unlikely to be stung. If you are allergic to bee stings, get immediate medical assistance if you are stung.\nWhen requested, the EH&S Pest Management staff will dust the cicada killer burrows with pyrethrum pesticide.  Contact with the dust will kill the adult, but it does not kill the eggs.  Therefore, cicada killers will return the following year.  The cicada killers are around for a month during the summer, but if you feel you can not coexist with this beneficial insect and must take action; here are a few suggestions for controlling the cicada killer population in your home.\r\n            \nCicada killers can not burrow in healthy turf and prefer well drained soils.  Keep the lawn well watered in the areas where they burrow to discourage them and hope they select another site for their home.\nIf they\u0092re burrowing in your planting beds, put down landscape fabric covered with mulch to discourage them.  A layer of fine gravel will also discourage them from burrowing.\nCicada killers are poor fliers and can be easily dispatched with the swing of a tennis racket or by stepping on them when they\u0092re near their burrow.\nPouring boiling water down each burrow at night when the females have returned will kill the adult and the eggs.\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t<!--\r\n\t\t\t\tfunction printMe()\r\n\t\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\t\twindow.print();\r\n\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t//-->\r\n\t\t\t\n\nPrint\n\n\nFacilities and Services | \r\n\t\tStony Brook University Home | \r\n\t\tNews | \r\n\t\tSearch Stony Brook\n\nCreated by Application Support for Administration\r\n\tEnvironmental Health and Safety @ Stony Brook University"], ["The Cicada Killers Are Coming - The Atlantic", "http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/07/the-cicada-killers-are-coming/277688/", "\n    The invasion of periodical cicadas is over, but a second\n    insect invasion looms. Sphecius speciosus, the Eastern cicada killers, have begun to emerge. And they make the national media hype over the cicadas look\n    rather misplaced. Hunting, warring, patrolling, tunneling, they do more in two months--the length of their adult lives--than periodical cicadas do in 17\n    years.\n\n\n    With bodies up to two inches in length, huge jaws, and glossy black paintjobs streaked with yellow, they are unmistakable, and more than a little\n    intimidating.\u00a0They emerge in July and August, to coincide with the hatching of annual-cycle cicadas, their sole prey--larger cousins of the periodical cicadas the nation\n    watched so obsessively earlier this summer.\n\n    Cicada killer females construct burrows that are small wonders of engineering and effort. Several feet long, and featuring numerous individual brood\n    chambers at their far end, they require the excavation of hundreds of times the insects' own weight in soil. The female killers manage the feat in just a\n    few hours, using only their jaws and hind legs.\n\n\n    After that they hunt, for the so-called dog-day cicadas of genus Tibicen. A killer paralyzes a cicada with a single sting, but getting it back to the\n    burrow can be an all-day affair. It may be three times the killer's own weight--too heavy to properly fly with. Instead she drags it up the nearest tree,\n    then launches herself, prey in claw, and glides as far as possible toward her burrow. She may have to repeat the process half a dozen times.\n\n\n    Back at the burrow, she deposits the paralyzed cicada in a brood chamber. Then she lays an egg and carefully tucks it beneath the cicada's foreleg, beside\n    the puncture wound from her sting. (The doomed creature looks, creepily, like a wizened old man with a baguette tucked under his arm.) The female then\n    seals the chamber with dirt, the cicada still living and immobilized within it. A few days later the egg hatches and grub begins to eat the cicada alive,\n    using the puncture wood as an entry point. Later, the grub spins a cocoon, in which it metamorphoses into an adult wasp, emerging the following year.\n    (Footage of these behaviors has been kindly posted online by filmmaker Sam Orr, who is working on a documentary about the 17-year cicadas.)\n\n\n    Meantime, the males are trying to win mates. Each claims about a square yard of territory. But because the bare ground on which these territories are\n    established is basically featureless, the boundaries are impossible for the other males to determine. The result is a constant war of all against all. (In\n    one experiment, a researcher laid down a grid of wooden dowels, providing visual cues for territorial boundaries. The violence immediately dropped by 80\n    percent.) There's a second indignity to male cicada killer life. Tethered by biological duty to their barren patches of earth, they get no relief from the\n    sun, and spend the summer barfing on their own heads to generate a little evaporative cooling.\n\n\n    Despite being top predators, cicada killers are themselves frequently victimized by other insects. Some of these go after the killers' grubs; Chuck\n    Holliday, emeritus professor of biology at Lafayette College and a leading cicada killer expert, recalls seeing one such parasitic fly approach a burrow\n    and, in full flight, drop its egg down the hole \"like one of those thermobaric bombs we used at Tora Bora.\" Aware of the danger, female cicada killers\n    attempt to outwit these \"satellite flies\"--so named because they hover around the much larger wasps as if orbiting them--by dropping to the ground and\n    remaining motionless for minutes at a time. Other cicada-killer antagonists go after the adults, spiking them with needle-like probosces and sucking out\n    their guts--\"the stuff of sand wasp nightmares, if they had them,\" as the late entomologist and science writer Howard Ensign Evans drily put it in his\n    masterwork.\n\n\n    We humans, happily, have nothing to fear, although we're very likely to encounter the insects. Cicada killers live almost everywhere east of the Rockies\n    and south of Ontario. Moreover, like pigeons, coyotes, and white-tailed deer, they actually benefit from human activity and enjoy suburban living. The soft\n    soil around home foundations, in gardens, and on golf courses and playgrounds is ideal for burrowing. Some of the first research into cicada killer\n    behavior was conducted beside two baseball fields in Brooklyn.\n\n\n    But unlike other wasp species that plague human summers, only the females of the cicada killers have\n    stingers, and both their sting and their temperament are very mild. Holliday has captured, tagged, clipped the wings of, and in other ways harassed\n    thousands of them in the course of his research. \"I've done abominable things to these animals, and I've never had one try to sting me,\" he says. Instead,\n    when threatened, they fly away or, if trapped in a burrow, frantically beat their wings against its walls, producing a loud rattlesnake-like whir. Male\n    cicada killers are entirely stingless, and though they do tend to brusquely approach anything that moves inside their territory, including people, they're\n    simply on the lookout for rivals and potential mates. Since humans are neither, they quickly break off their \"attacks.\"\n\n\nIf your lawn becomes infested with killers and you simply must exterminate them, Holliday has a    complete guide. But, as Evans wrote\n    when considering the insect, these aren't \"really necessary for the nonentomophobic among us who can tolerate a few brown spots in our lawns and occasional\n    libidinous, dive-bombing male wasps.\" And Holliday encourages, instead, using them to introduce children to nature's intricate clockworks. Their\n    predictable, curious behaviors are just the thing for capturing young minds. As for adult appreciation, the killers are some of the most effective\n    cicada-silencers around. After the last few months' deafening treetop chorus, their presence should be welcome.\n\n\nTim Heffernan is a writer based in New York City.

Known as sphecius speciosus to entomologists, cicada killers get active in the summer and will frighten most anyone they confront. Cicada killers are most black with some yellow stripes and grow to be over two inches long.\nIn case this is not what you\u2019re looking for, we also have\u00a0in depth articles on: \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0DIGGER WASPS\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0EUROPEAN HORNETS\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0HORNTAIL WASPS\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0MUD DAUBERS\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0WASPS\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 YELLOW JACKETS\n\u00a0\nCicada killers will dig their nests throughout the yard, mulch and sand areas and will generally frighten anyone who sees them. Like most wasps, they can sting. They use their stinger to sedate and paralyze cicada\u2019s. Cicada killers will hunt cicadas during the summer months when populations are active. They will find a cicada, sting it and bring it back to it\u2019s nest. This short video shows a female Cicada Killer in action.\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nOnce the cicada has been pumped full of toxins and rendered helpless, it will be brought back to the burrow where the paralyzed cicada will serve as food for the young cicada killers. Most egg burrows will have one or two cicadas for every egg which is laid. Nests usually only have one egg chamber, but when populations are high, cicada killers will dig extra chambers or extra nests to accommodate reproduction capabilities. This will vary from year to year as the cicada population varies. Old folklore states that cicadas are active every 7 or 12 years, but in fact some will emerge every year - depending on the region. Cicada killer populations will vary depending on the hatch or release of cicadas. In general, the more cicadas, the more cicada killers.\n\u00a0\nCicada killers are a nuisance around the home because the dig large nests which are unsightly. These nests are sometimes thought to be from an animal because they are so big.\n\n\nCicada Killers will spend their days foraging and if you watch the nest, you may catch them entering or leaving. Since they are so large, most people are petrified of them. In fact, cicada killers are generally not aggressive, but don\u2019t irritate them. Stay clear of their nests and be sure to keep children away from them as well. Since the nest will not go away on it\u2019s own and will probably be active from year to year, it is best to treat them as soon as you see it developing. There are several ways to do the treatment and the method you choose largely depends on how comfortable you feel doing the work as well as the cost factor.\n\u00a0\nIf you have one or two nests and are only seeing one or two adults, control should be easy. Use STING RAY WASP FREEZE for a quick knockdown of adults as they are entering or leaving a nest. CB Wasp Freeze uses a combination of active ingredients which will work on a wasp even as large as cicada killers. Be careful of less expensive over-the-counter aerosols. Many such formulations are not strong enough for this type of wasp. Once the adult has been sprayed and is dead, watch the nest for a few days. If no activity is noted, you have probably solved the problem. If you see new activity the following year, you will need to go to the second treatment option to insure they don\u2019t come back.\nSting Ray: \u00a0http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/aerosol/sting-ray-wasp-freeze\n\u00a0\nThe second treatment option is to use liquid concentrates. You may want to employ this method if you are afraid of treating with Wasp Freeze because you don\u2019t want to get close  to the nest or if you have several nests that need to be treated. Liquid treatments should be done at night so there is little risk of conflict with adults. Liquid treatments are cheaper to do than using Wasp Freeze and will enable you to treat large infestations economically.\nMore importantly, liquid treatments will provide some residual in the hole so you may be able to kill newly hatched or developing larva. This could prove important when dealing with chronic infestations.\n\u00a0\nUse CYPERMETHRIN and SPREADER STICKER mixed together and soak their nests. Cypermethrin will provide a residual for a month or more. The Spreader Sticker allows the treatment to penetrate the adults quicker which kills them before they know what is happening. This eliminates the possibility of being stung. Since nests can be large with more than one egg chamber, you should treat each hole by applying 1/2 to 1 gallon of mixed solution. This insures proper coverage and distribution throughout the chambers.\nCypermethrin: http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/liquid/viper-cypermethrin\nSpreader Sticker: http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/additive/spreader-sticker\n\u00a0\nSince most active areas have several nests, liquid treatments are more economical than using any type of Wasp Freeze. Use a PUMP SPRAYER with the tip set to pin stream and spray into their hole non stop till you know you\u2019ve applied at least 1/2 gallon per hole.\nEliminator Pump Sprayer: http://www.bugspraycart.com/equipment/sprayers/eliminator-gallon-sprayer\n\u00a0\nIf you are unsure where the nest is located, broadcast the liquid treatment over the area using a HOSE END SPRAYER. You will first need to see where they are most active. Next, try to narrow the area down to the smallest section of turf that you can. You can do this by watching where you see them enter or leave mulch and plant areas. Cicada killers will have specific flight paths they will use to enter and fly around nests. Unfortunately, the actual hole is sometimes masked and covered and hard to see.\nHose End Sprayer: \u00a0http://www.bugspraycart.com/equipment/sprayers/gilmour-20g-390\n\u00a0\nUsing the Cypermethrin listed above, you will need to broadcast it over the 100 sq/ft where you think they are nesting. You\u2019ll need to saturate the ground when using this technique so expect to use 2-3 gallons per 100 sq/ft.\u00a0This method is more of a shotgun approach and will not kill adults immediately. It usually takes several days for them to die, but they will be exposed to small amounts of the cypermethrin over time as they travel in and out of their nest which will eventually kill them. TREAT DAILY TILL ALL ACTIVITY STOPS.\n\u00a0\nOne last treatment option that\u2019s highly effective is to dust nests directly using DRIONE DUST and a HAND DUSTER. This method is fast acting and only takes a few seconds to do. Treat at night when all the nest occupants are sure to be back at their nest. Approach nests quietly (bring a flashlight if you cannot see the nest clearly) and make sure you know how many holes there are so you\u2019re prepared to treat them all in one visit.\nDrione: \u00a0http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/dust/drione-dust\nHand Duster: http://www.bugspraycart.com/equipment/dusters/crusader\n\u00a0\nEach hole should receive 1-2 heavy puffs of Drione so you\u2019ll only be able to treat 4-8 holes per filling of the Hand Duster. Drione works quickly and it \u201cfloats\u201d well inside their nest meaning it will surely get down deep and penetrate every area insuring all the next occupants will die. And once the Drione covers them, they\u2019ll be dead within the hour. The following video shows how to properly dust a cicada killer nest.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next day you should watch the treated nests from afar and if you spy any that still have activity, plan on treating them again later that evening. Repeat until all nest activity stops.\nOne added benefit of using Drione is that the dust will readily absorb cicada killer odors and pheromones. This is important for preventing new nests. Since we know foraging cicada killers are always looking for good nest locations, once your yard has 3-5 nests in the ground it will be more likely to attract new adults searching for a good location to tunnel. This happens because existing nests release smells (undetectable by humans) which other cicada killers can detect from long distances away. And once they \u201csmell\u201d your yard as being good for nest building, they\u2019ll take advantage. This is one of the main reasons nests tend to keep appearing in the same area year after year.\nBut dusting with Drione can effectively diffuse these scents which will prevent new cicada killers from finding your yard. So for long term protection, dusting with Drione has its advantages.\n\u00a0\nRemember that cicada killers late in the season will have already laid eggs and it is highly likely that you will have some activity the following year if you don\u2019t treat thoroughly in the summer and fall once activity is discovered. This is because it\u2019s hard to reach the eggs that are buried deep in the ground and without being able to directly treat them, chances are high the eggs will be able to hatch safely and feed without a problem since they\u2019ll have their required food.\nThis means the following spring, as soon as it starts to warm, the pupae will start hatching and the adults will begin to emerge. This process can take a month or two, well before you actually see any, and in fact is a good time to launch an attack and get them before the summer starts.\u00a0Additionally, once a good nesting area is located, adults will try to use such ground from year to year due to a lingering \u201cscent\u201d or \u201cpheromones\u201d in the area. This means any that emerge in your neighborhood will naturally be drawn to your nests looking for mates, good ground for new nests, etc. For this reason it\u2019s important to treat previous nest sites early in the spring, at least once a month, with liquid applications of Cypermethrin.\nNow if you believe you have succeeded in killing off previous nests but want to make sure no new nests form, this can be accomplished by treating early in year and then throughout the warm season for your region. So if apply BIFEN GRANULES and CYONARA RTS every 2 months to your yard, gardens, flower beds and island areas around the home, you can stop new nests from forming all year. Basically this combination will put in place a protective barrier so any foraging cicada killers that might consider using you yard for new nests will move away.\nBifen Granules: \u00a0http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/granule/bifenthrin-g-25-lb\nCyonara RTS: \u00a0http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/liquid/cyonara-32-oz-rts\n\u00a0\nBy treating known nest sites early before summer, you\u2019ll have a good chance of killing the hatching adults before they get above ground and get active for the summer. This strategy works because repeatedly treating will enable the Cypermethrin to percolate down into the ground which in turn can get the newly hatching adults before they can ever emerge. During their spring hatch, they\u2019re vulnerable but hard to reach in the ground unless you\u2019ve been treating on a regular basis that started in early spring.\n\n\nGive us a call if you need further help.

CAN I JUST PLANT SOD OVER THE NEST? MY BACKYARD HAS LITTLE GRASS SO NOW I SEE WHY I HAVE THE NEST IN MY YARD VS MY NEIGHBORS.\nOf course you can put sod over the top of the nests. But if you are thinking that this will affect them in some way you are wrong. They\u2019ll merely chew through the sod within minutes and be right back to their normal day to day activity. In fact, they\u2019d no doubt like the sod since it will protect them more providing shelter from the sun and rain.\nSo if you decide to lay any down and you have nests that are active, be sure to treat first with the liquid or dust spray listed above.

And since the dust should be going down deep into the hole, moisture around at the entrance of their nest and on the top soil will take awhile to penetrate enough to have any impact. \nThat being said, if you have a heavy rain just after dusting and note activity the day after treating, treat again with the Drione.\nDrione:  http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/dust/drione-dust\nHand Duster: http://www.bugspraycart.com/equipment/dusters/crusader\nWe have 9 nests right around our pool an a dog and a 10 year old daughter. They swarm around us and I don\u2019t know what to do.\nI suggest you read the article above and either liquid treat with the Cypermethrin or dust them with the Drione. Both options work well.\nCypermethrin: http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/liquid/viper-cypermethrin\nDrione:  http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/dust/drione-dust\nhttp://www.bugspray.com/articles99/cicadakillers.html#cicada-killer-treatments\nGenerally one to three per hole. And as our article above explains, if you don\u2019t start treating it will just get worse and worse.\n Cicada Killers: http://www.bugspray.com/articles99/cicadakillers.html#cicada-killer-treatments\nIt can. But as our article explains, you really need to get the treatment into their nests. \nWith that being said, I suggest you lift some of the slats to get a better view of where they\u2019re going, if there are nests reachable, etc. and then directly treat as many as possible. \nNow if the slats are close to the ground, dusting through them could get enough of the Drione into the nest because it will float around quite a bit when applied. In fact, it can drive several feet and this could be a viable way to treat the area \u201cblindly\u201d. But you\u2019ll have to pay special attention to where they enter and then apply the dust directly to that spot. If that\u2019s where the nest is, you could very well take care of them this way.\nDrione:  http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/dust/drione-dust\nHand Duster: http://www.bugspraycart.com/equipment/dusters/crusader\nLast year we had several cicada killer nests in our yard. My husband treated them with delta dust and presto, they were gone almost overnight. This year they returned and we only found 2 nests (which he treated) but still have tons of cicadas swarming around our backyard. We also noticed that some were starting to hang out in our front yard. What do we do to get rid of them if we can\u2019t find anymore nests? I\u2019m scared to be outside with my 2 young children.\nThe next best thing to do when you can\u2019t find their nests is to treat the ground or other areas where they are seen with Cypermethrin. It can kill them if they land on treated surfaces enough and if you spray their nests, it will get them over time too. Also, it will work on the cicada\u2019s as well.\nHere is a link to this item in our cart. Please show your support for our business by purchasing the items we recommend from the links provided.

Thanks for your business!\nCypermethrin: http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/liquid/viper-cypermethrin\nSafety precautions for pets and humans if I use the Drione dust over a large area.\nFirst and foremost, everything listed above in our article can be used safely around people and pets. In fact we have safety videos on every product page which goes over most everything you\u2019ll need to know regarding general safety guidelines. Additionally, Drione does not require any special preparation or followups after being applied and in general, just keeping pets and children away during the application is all you need to do to use it safely. And within an hour (longer if you want to wait to make sure the target pest is gone), everyone can return to the treated area.\nDrione:  http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/dust/drione-dust\nMore importantly, Drione should be applied directly into the nests of the Cicada Killers to get the best results. That being said, it is labeled for use over lawns like one would apply a lawn granule. Now in our opinion that would be wasteful since you don\u2019t need to use it this way to get control of cicada killers. But the point is you can use it this way safely with no hazard to people or pets and therefore, if you apply it directly to the nests as you should for cicada killers, there would be little or no exposure to people or pets and therefore no risk or hazard presented.\nWe have cicada killers flying around and burrowing in the sandbox at our daycare center.  There does not seem to be a nest any where in the area.  The children love to play in the sandbox!  Are there any \u201chome remedies\u201d/non-toxic of course that I could do to get rid of them?  I am really uncomfortable with spraying or dusting the area with the kids playing in and near the sandbox area. Any help you could give would be greatly appreciated!\nFirst, the \u201cburrows\u201d you see are in fact their nests. Second, the sting from these wasps can be a problem so they must be controlled to avoid conflict with the kids. Third, treating playgrounds and places where kids are playing falls into the category of \u201csensitive areas\u201d which means that only the safest products should be used when pest control treatments are needed. And for that need, the Essentria line is the only way to go.\nMade from food and plant oils, these federally exempt products pose no hazard to people or pets. Review the label yourself and you\u2019ll see the product can be applied at boat docks around water, in schools and even playgrounds. Essentria has this liberal label because once mixed with water, it has such a low impact on the environment that it can be used safely when treating sensitive areas. The good news is that it can still control a wide range of pests even though it is so safe.\nEssentria IC3: http://www.bugspraycart.com/exempt/liquid/eco-excempt-gal\nSo in this case, I would mix up 4 oz per gallon of water and pump one full gallon per burrow that\u2019s active. I\u2019d repeat this daily until I saw no activity the following day. So if you treat one evening and note that half the burrows are quiet the next day but half still have activity, treat the active burrows a second time. Repeat this process until they\u2019re all gone. Essentria is labeled for use as a soil drench and won\u2019t pose a hazard when used this way so the kids will be okay to use the area the next day after you treat. And once the cicada killers are gone, the kids (and you) won\u2019t have to worry about getting stung anymore.\nI have like 5-10 of these in my backyard and they pretty much stay right in front of the door on my shed.  There is a gap between the bottom of the shed to the ground which is where I think they have made their nests but I can not be sure.  I have stood there for several minutes waiting to see if they go under the shed but I have not caught them in the act.  There are no visible nests on the ground anywhere so they have to be under there.  What is the best way to destroy the nest if I can not see them.  Please help because my daughter is extremely terrified of these things\u2026.not that I can blame her :)\nI have seen and treated similar scenarios for this pest. In the cases I\u2019ve handled, the sheds have been resting on the ground or close to it with access to the space underneath most commonly made at the entrance way to the shed. Some of these sheds have two swinging doors; others have normal single doorways. But in most all cases, there is a floor board and a slight space which is an ideal place for many pests to nest.\nAnd once they gain access to such a small space, it can be tough to treat. What I\u2019ve learned is that the Drione, because of it\u2019s \u201csmoke\u201d like nature, can do the job. But it will only work up to 100 sq/ft. So if the entire shed is 10 feet wide by 10 feet deep, you should be able to get it properly dusted from one spot as long as the space underneath is fairly open to allow the Drione to drift about. If you watch the Drione video, you\u2019ll see that it\u2019s very light and will carry a long way so as long as that space is open, you\u2019ll get the needed penetration.\nNow the way you want to approach this kind of job is to use a Hand Duster and pump the Drione making sure to get about 6-8 oz per 10 x 10 area. We\u2019d then let it sit for 1 week we\u2019d get the desired results. But if we still found activity, we\u2019d request the floor be cut up so we could direct treat using either Drione or the Cypermethrin. \nDrione:  http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/dust/drione-dust\nHand Duster: http://www.bugspraycart.com/equipment/dusters/crusader\nSo I would say to try the same approach because it will work; if the shed is 10 x 10 or smaller, the small sized Drione would be plenty. But after a week if you still see them flying around, opt to open up the area so the nests will become accessible and a direct treatment easier to make.\nWe have been seeing two cicada killers flying around and they are going in and out of a crack that is under the cement steps that go into the front door of our house.  We have captured the two adults females and are observing them with NO intent of releasing them.  What would be the best method to use to treat the nests that are most likely under our steps?  We can\u2019t move the steps but there are areas around the steps with cracks that we could possibly spray bug killer into.  Any advice would be helpful.  We LOVE our cicadas and look forward to watching them every year as they hatch and dry their beautiful wings.  A week ago I heard them singing in our trees and now we don\u2019t hear any.  I want these cicada killers gone!\nThanks!\nThis sounds like a great place to employ the Drione Dust. Light and smokey, it will surely penetrate all the way into the hidden voids under the steps when applied with a Hand Duster. And once it permeates this area, any developing young or adults that try to move in the treatment will die.\nHere is a link to this item in our cart.

What do you recommend for treatment of an area this size?  The arena is sandy about 6-10\u2033 deep.\nLook forward to your response.\nThank you.\nI have them in behind the siding of my house right under the edge of the roof. How do I get to them to get rid of them?\nCicada Killers are ground dwellers and only nest in dirt. I suspect you either have Yellow Jackets, which are much smaller:\nYellow Jackets:  http://www.bugspray.com/article/yellowjackets.html\nAnother possibility is European Hornets. These are quite large too and closely resemble Cicada Killers. They\u2019ll readily nest in trees and homes and are active right now. Read up on them here:\nEuropean Hornets: http://www.bugspray.com/article/eurohornet.html\nNo doubt dusting the holes with Drione as explained above would prove to be more efficient compared to spraying. If you hit the nests in the evening, you should be able to knock most of them out instantly. After the first treatment, expect to do 1-2 followups to get the ones you miss. This happens most times; especially when there are a lot of nests to treat so it\u2019s normal not to get them all at once. But the Drione is quick and efficient over the spray for this type of treatment.\nDrione:  http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/dust/drione-dust\nHand Duster: http://www.bugspraycart.com/equipment/dusters/crusader\nDoes permethrin work as well as cypermethrin in the treatment of cicada killer wasps? I have permethrin in the form of guards tar ground drench as I am a hobby beekeeper with 15 hives and I use it for the control of hive beetles.\nSorry but no. For the same reason that Permethrin can be used around bees safely it\u2019s just not strong enough to effectively deal with Cicada Killers. In fact, Cypermethrin is a \u201cnewer\u201d generation of Permethrin. Closely related, it\u2019s made from the same base chemical chain with the main difference being that less of it is needed for target pests. But even Cypermethrin is barely strong enough on this pest and really, the Drione is the best way to go if possible.\nCypermethrin: http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/liquid/viper-cypermethrin\nDrione:  http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/dust/drione-dust\nHand Duster: http://www.bugspraycart.com/equipment/dusters/crusader\nWe have 2 big guys flying around our sidewalk and our neighbors driveway.  We see them disappear under some crab grass but we can\u2019t see any holes.  This is the first year we have had them and we are scared to death of them because we have 3 small children.  If we use the above mentioned methods but not know where the exact point of entry is will it be successful?   We are doing the 50 yard dash everyday from our front door to our vehicles.\nIf you can narrow the location where they\u2019re active to just a couple of square feet, you should be able to have success even without knowing exactly where the entry hole is located. So lets say you know the spot is somewhere in the range of a garbage pail cover, that would be small enough to achieve success even without knowing the exact entrance point.\nSo if you\u2019ve got the location narrowed down to something that small, you can attack them with the Cypermethrin by mixing and applying 1 gallon over the spot every evening. Now understand it will most certainly take more than 1-2 treatments to get them all but if you apply 1 gallon to this spot for at least 3 nights in a row, you should be penetrating the ground well enough to insure they\u2019ll die. \nNow I have seen where 4-5 treatments are needed every now and then but that would be extreme and usually involves cases where there are 10-20 cicada killers nesting. Since you\u2019re only seeing 2, I\u2019m sure less will do the job.\nCypermethrin: http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/liquid/viper-cypermethrin\nI have purchased the drione dust and a duster.  I watched a video about how the drione dust works and it was mentioned that one of the components irritates the pest it contacts.  If I dust the holes at night, will the irritation the dust causes have the cicada killers flying out ready to sting?\nWhen done properly, so much dust would be applied to the nest that the cicada killers won\u2019t be able to leave quickly because they\u2019ll be caught off guard and totally covered in dust. This will many times cause them to die in their nests but in cases where they might eventually crawl out after being directly dusted will take a few minutes. That gives you plenty of time to clear the area since the time needed to dust is just a few seconds per hole.\nDrione:  http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/dust/drione-dust\nHand Duster: http://www.bugspraycart.com/equipment/dusters/crusader\nWhere can I purchase the Drione Dust?\nDrione is a specialty product that\u2019s won\u2019t be located in retail shops. Order it on line through our site; we ship within one business day.\nDrione:  http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/dust/drione-dust\nHand Duster: http://www.bugspraycart.com/equipment/dusters/crusader\nIn getting rid of Cicada killers, I saw where you mention to another person that putting sod over top of them won\u2019t stop them because eventually they will chew right through the sod. How about applying mulch?\nLaying weed fabric on the ground and over nests then laying mulch down over that. Shouldn\u2019t this method rid the cicada killers at least over time?\nIf you have established nests, neither mulch or weed fabric will help. Here\u2019s why.\nWasps have powerful chewing mouth parts and can chew through most anything. We\u2019ve seen active nests chew through thick plastic that was laid down over them and in the end, the only way these nests were controlled was by treating them with either the Drione or Cypermethrin listed above.\nDrione:  http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/dust/drione-dust\nCypermethrin: http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/liquid/viper-cypermethrin\nAdditionally, once an area gets nests, there are certain pheromones that will linger. These scents are nothing you or I can detect but to cicada killers, they\u2019re powerful smells that indicate things like good nest site locations. That means your land is naturally attracting this pest all the time and one of the main reasons why you typically get more and more nesting every year.\nNow if you treat your existing nests with one of the methods mentioned above, let it stand for a day or two to make sure it\u2019s dead and then cover it with some weed fabric, the chances of it getting new nests will be reduced. Just don\u2019t cover it up and think the problem will go away because they\u2019re way too strong for this approach to be effective.\nI live in Connecticut and it seems we are unable to buy any of the listed treatments.  Can you ship to CT.?  If not then is there a CT-acceptable alternative?  We have multiple nests outside the front door and they have totally succeeded in freaking us out.   Thanks.\nIf you wish to treat the nests the most direct way via the listed dust, Drione is the way to go. No problem sending it to you:\nDrione:  http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/dust/drione-dust\nHand Duster: http://www.bugspraycart.com/equipment/dusters/crusader\nIf you wish to liquid spray, we have several options. One is Permethrin which is closely related to CyPermethrin. You will need to mix more per gallon so instead of just 1 oz you\u2019ll need to use 4 oz. \nVegetables Plus Perm: http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/liquid/veg-plus-10-perm\nAnd if you\u2019re wanting to cover a large area via a hose end sprayer, get the Cyonara RTS.\nCyonara RTS:  http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/liquid/cyonara-32-oz-rts\nI\u2019ll tell you one thing, people will tell you they don\u2019t sting\u2026..for sure they are WRONG! I\u2019m nursing a massive sting this morning from one of these cicada killers and it is VERY painful!!\nThanks or sharing. The one thing we have found is that anyone who tells us they don\u2019t \u201csting\u201d is someone who has never been stung. I guess that only makes sense. But since I\u2019ve been working with insects for over 30 years, the one thing I know is that any insect species which has a stinger can in fact use it at any time. And if you happen to be in the way of that stinger when they decide to use it? Well, you\u2019ll end up feeling it\u2019s wrath.\nNot surprisingly, we hear this a lot regarding snakes and spiders. The common comment is \u201cyou don\u2019t have to worry about that snake (or spider) because they\u2019re not venomous\u201d. Well, rest assured, if it\u2019s got jaws and teeth, it can bite. \nAnd just because it doesn\u2019t have venom it does not mean the bite the will go un noticed. Just try and grab a water snake and see what it will do to any unprotected skin you have within striking distance! Same with Wolf spiders. They have powerful jaws and their bite will leave a nasty mark.\nThe moral of the story is you should avoid contact with insects and animals to avoid getting stung or bit. And that means keeping their populations minimized in and around the home is the way to insure you don\u2019t cross paths because really, it\u2019s just a game of numbers. Less conflict, less chance of getting bit or stung.\nTech Support\u2013I had a large number of of cicada killer wasp nests during August, but they seemed to have become inactive. I can still see the entrances to the nests. Should I treat the nests with Drione dust at this time or wait until next year to see if they return? Please advise. Thanks.\nNo doubt treating now will help. Nests may not have active adults but they can contain developing larvae and pupae. By treating with Drione and then filling the holes with some dirt will enable you to get ahead of the problem big time.\nDrione:  http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/dust/drione-dust\nNow as explained above, there will always be some stages you can\u2019t kill so don\u2019t expect to be free of them next year. That being said, the problem will no doubt be a lot easier to work on if you do some of what\u2019s required now.\nWas wondering, since the larvae grow in the ground, would laying down grub killer in the spring affect them at all before they actually turn into adults and come out?\nUnfortunately no. There are a few reasons.\nThe first is that traditional grub killers are designed to get the grubs as they feed shallow. So these treatments aren\u2019t getting deep enough. The Cypermethrin we recommend penetrates a lot deeper. Like 5-10 times as deep compared to granules. And this is important. \nAlso, as explained in our Grub Control article, most people only treat grubs once in the new year which is not nearly enough. And it\u2019s not even the best time to get Cicada Killers anyway with just granules.\nThe main reason is that as our article above explains, the cicada killers will be in their pupae stage as the new year rolls around. This means they\u2019re in a shell which no chemical can get through anyway (the vulnerable larvae stage is active in the fall and early winter and then goes into it\u2019s pupae shell for the winter). So as the last section of our article above explains, the only way to get them once the new year starts is to liquid spray from early spring on. \nNow if you treat with the Cypermethrin in the spring, it can penetrate deep into the soil so adult cicada killers that are emerging can be affected and killed. This can happen because when they come out in spring and summer, the process will take weeks and during this time they are weak and vulnerable. So if the soil has been treated, you can kill them before they ever get above ground and active.\nOn a side note, the converse of what you were asking about will work on grubs. In other words, if you were treating for Cicada Killers like we explain above and started your treatments last fall, the treatments you did would have killed off any grubs in your yard. \nOf course, you would have to treat the entire yard and many times cicada killer treatments are restricted to a small area because that\u2019s the only place you see them. But my point is the cicada killer treatments are highly effective on all grubs and no doubt the best way to get rid of them too.\nI had two of these Cicada Killer males in my house. Why do you think it came in the house? How do I make sure that they don\u2019t get my house again? I did not have any windows open \u2026\nAre you sure they were cicada killers? I ask because this species of wasp will not get active until cicada\u2019s are out which generally won\u2019t happen until late May or June. So if you\u2019re in the United States somewhere, it\u2019s highly unlikely they were cicada killers.\nNow what is likely is that what you saw was some other species of wasp. They\u2019ll commonly get inside homes in the spring as they become very active following the winter and this is in fact happening right now all around the USA. \nPaper wasps, golden wasps and mud daubers are the most likely species to get inside and all three can be repelled and controlled by using either Cypermethrin or NBS.\nCypermethrin: http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/liquid/viper-cypermethrin\nNBS Repellent:  http://www.bugspraycart.com/exempt/additive/nbs-paint-additive-16-oz\nYou can read up more on Mud Daubers and other Wasps here:\nMud Daubers: http://www.bugspray.com/articles99/muddauber.html#mud-dauber-treatments\nWasps: http://www.bugspray.com/wasp_treatments.html\nPlease show your support for our business by purchasing the items we recommend from the links provided.

Thanks for your business!\n\n\nFor the first time ever, we\u2019ve seen these cicada killers flying between our neighbors yard and our driveway.  We\u2019ve only seen a couple.  They tend to fly back and forth and sometimes go into the cracks in our concrete driveway.  Would they have built nests in those cracks?  We\u2019ve searched our yard and do not see any of the type of nests you described.  Please advise.  Thank you!\nThey love living under cement so yes, there is a high chance of nests being located under sidewalks, patio and driveway slabs. And when they nest in such locations, it can be tricky to treat them properly. I say this because many times there are small spaces under the cement which causes liquids to \u201creroute\u201d and miss the nest altogether. These spaces and voids are quite normal and basically happen where the dirt settles or runs off over time following the installation of the cement.\nHowever, these voids will many times cause liquid applications to be ineffective. So with that being said, the best method to use through cement cracks is the Drione Dust. As the video we posted of what Drione looks like when applied (very smoky) demonstrates, its the only treatment that will blanket the underside of the cement and travel to the nest thus insuring you get the targeted wasps. \nSo go with the Drione to insure you get good coverage when treating which in turn will knock them out for good.\nDrione:  http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/dust/drione-dust\nHand Duster: http://www.bugspraycart.com/equipment/dusters/crusader\n\n\nHi. I have probably 40 \u2013 60 of these wasps around my driveway. I have a retaining rock wall they have destroyed nesting in it. They push a ton of dirt out on my driveway and I\u2019ll clean it up and the next day there is more dirt.  I can\u2019t pour things down their nests because its in the walls. I\u2019m on my last nerve and have no clue what else to do.\nIf you review our article above, you\u2019ll see there is a section that shows how to dust for them using a dry product known as Drione. This method is 100% effective, works instantly and will not undermine the walls.\nThe video in the article above shows how easy it is to do and no doubt, this is how you should handle this problem. \nBased on the amount of activity you have, I\u2019d say the 1 lb jar of Drione will be enough. You\u2019ll probably go through 1/2 to 3/4 of the jar but as you\u2019ll see in the video, it only takes 1-2 seconds to treat each hole so its a very easy way to handle them.\nDrione:  http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/dust/drione-dust\nHand Duster: http://www.bugspraycart.com/equipment/dusters/crusader\nNow if you\u2019re worried about getting stung, get a Bee Suit, Veil and Hat.

At this time of the year what would be a better (more effective) product to control them \u2013 Drione or the Cypermethrin?   My local garden center said to use liquid 7 and spray that in each hole.  However I have not seen any results.\nEither option will work regardless of the time of year. The key is understanding that you need to kill them now, before they get eggs laid on cicada\u2019s they hunt down and kill. But even after you kill the ones you see active right now you still need to liquid spray next spring and early summer to kill the hatching pupae that are no doubt in the ground developing. In fact, failure to liquid treat in the spring and early summer is one of the main reasons they\u2019ll keep coming back.\nSo dust or liquid treat now to kill all the active nests (personally I prefer the Drione dust because its so easy, fast and effective). Next, remember to liquid spray with Cypermethrin next spring/early summer so any hatching pupae die and by this time next year you\u2019ll be cicada killer free.\nDrione Dust: http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/dust/drione-dust\nHand Duster: http://www.bugspraycart.com/equipment/dusters/crusader\nCypermethrin:  http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/liquid/viper-cypermethrin\nOkay\u2026.I didn\u2019t read anywhere\u2026.but the killers are literally eating my lilac Bush! This is the first I have seen them doing this and they have invited all other types of wasps to join them\u2026.they are killing my lilacs. There are a whole bunch of them\u2026.how would you suggest getting rid of them? The Bush is 15 feet by 15 feet\u2026and I have two of them\u2026\nThere are several wasps that will do this and they behave this way for a variety of reasons. And you are right; if you let them do as they want, your lilac bush will probably succumb to the attacks and die because they are stripping the plant away piece by piece.\nFortunately there is a simple way to treat the problem. We have a unique product that can be sprayed over the entire lilac (or any other plant you want to protect) that will control all wasps and other pest that walk over or land on the treatment. \nMind you this product is not like most traditional insecticides which kill on contact. For example, the Cypermethrin listed above will not work for what you need. This is because Cypermethrin will only kill wasps that land on it so in the end, the nests will continue to live because they\u2019ll just keep sending more and more adults to replace the ones you kill.\nBut the one product we carry that\u2019s perfect for your problem is special because it doesn\u2019t kill on contact. In fact, it will take a good 2-3 days to start working. But this is very much by design. \nIt\u2019s also undetectable so the wasps don\u2019t know they\u2019re landing on a chemical. But when they do, they\u2019ll pick up a little bit of the active and in doing so, bring it back to their nest where they\u2019re transfer some of it to other members of the nest. And over the course of 2-3 days, the active will get spread around eventually getting transferred to most every member in the colony. This way when it does start working, the entire nest will die.\nKnown as Optigard Flex, this odorless concentrate is easy to mix and apply. It will probably take a good gallon of mixed solution to do the treatment but it will work like nothing else can. Expect attacks and damage to stop within a week of the application being done.\nAlso, Optigard is good for a wide range of pests like ants, termites and roaches. Its unique mode of action makes it ideal for hard to control pests that nest in communities with large populations hard to find.\n\n\nHere is a link to this item in our cart.

We received some fill dirt last year when we were re-seeding our yard.  This year we have a large infestation of cicada killers.  We never had the problem before. We\u2019re wondering if the problem came with the fill dirt.\nIn fact one of the most common ways insects are relocated is via fill dirt, sod, potted plants and other landscape related materials so yes, its entirely possible and frankly, quite possible.\nBut its also possible that you had 1-2 nests last year which went unnoticed. As our article above explains, 1-2 nests will become 5-10 the following year and then 25-50 by the third year so problems can literally \u201cexplode\u201d from one year to the next.\nThe bottom line is that now would be a great time to take care of this issue by treating with Drione Dust and killing the active nests now. This would thwart the developing populous before you have an exponentially worse problem next year.\nDrione:  http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/dust/drione-dust\nHand Duster: http://www.bugspraycart.com/equipment/dusters/crusader\nMore on how to dust with Drione can be seen in our video here:\nhttp://www.bugspray.com/articles99/cicadakillers.html#cicada-killer-dust-treatments\n\n\nI have about 5 holes in the ground from cicada killer wasps. They are large and they look just like the pictures. Confused as to why I have them though because there are no Cicadas in Southern California (San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles). I have lived in this house for 20 years and have never had them before. Was wondering how far down the holes are and where in that hole do they lay their eggs. I want to be able to kill the eggs as well so I do not have them back next year. Thanks.\nFirst, there are many \u201crelated\u201d wasps to cicada killers and though the main species feed on cicadas, their closely related cousins will target other pests for food. In fact cicada killers will target other insects for food as well so their range will many times move into regions that don\u2019t have active cicadas. But since they can adapt and find other food sources, they can no doubt thrive in these cicada free regions. So in your yard you could very well have cicada killers. But then again, it could be a closely related species that behaves in the same fashion. Either way, treatments are will be the same and effective regardless of what species they might be.\nSecond, the main reason why anyone gets these wasps in the first place is because untreated turf is prime real estate for them (and pretty much any insect) to use for nesting. Basically these wasps target open landscaping so the turf around most any home is what they consider to be a \u201cprime\u201d nest site. And if you\u2019re not treating your yard with some granules and liquid spray throughout the year, your turf will be subject to insect invasion. \nNow when we think of insects in the yard, no doubt we think of the common perimeter pests like ants, roaches, crickets and millipedes. But there are plenty of flying pests like cicada killers who can take advantage of the opportunity too and from what you\u2019re describing in your message, it sounds like this has happened in your yard.\nThird, cicada killer nests will range from 1 foot to several feet deep (I\u2019ve seen them 4-5 feet down), depending on the species, the type of ground they\u2019re digging through, etc. And though \u201ckilling the eggs\u201d is a great idea, this cannot be done. Simply put, there is no chemical strong enough to kill their eggs (at least none labeled for this pest in the ground) so the best approach available is what you see in the article above.\nAnd as you\u2019ll learn from the info above, this approach is to dust the holes you see with Drione and then cap them off. The dust will last 6-12 months in the hole so that it will immediately kill any that hatch from their eggs or pupae. And it will also kill any active adults that might be using the holes at this time.\nDrione:  http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/dust/drione-dust\nHand Duster: http://www.bugspraycart.com/equipment/dusters/crusader\nCorks:  http://www.bugspraycart.com/equipment/equipment-plugs/cork-12\nNext, it would be wise to start applying granules and some liquid spray to the rest of the yard every 2 months to prevent new nests from forming. No doubt once a yard gets activity, the \u201cscent\u201d from the existing populous tends to attract more and more cicada killers which is why the problem will get worse from year to year. But this scenario can be prevented by actively treating your yard with granules and spray.

Ready to go out tonight and spray the nest(s) that we observe today (looks like a couple right now).  After reading all the comments, however, should I have gotten the Drione dust instead?  Does it work better and more thorough?  I was skeptical bout using the dust and feel more comfortable with the liquid, pump and extended hose.  Thanks!\nVita,\nNo doubt most people are more \u201ccomfortable\u201d using the liquid since its something they typically know and understand. And if you want to go this route, you can achieve success. Just be sure to use enough and to do 2-3 applications this year along with 1-2 next year in the spring and early summer to make sure they don\u2019t return.\nAlternatively, the dust will yield longer lasting results with less effort. In most cases, just 1-2 applications will do the job and since it stays in the ground active longer, its sure to get hatching young. \nIn the end, both options will work equally as long as you stay the course and understand that you will need to treat a few times when using the liquid which is a bit more compared to the dust.\nTechnical Support\nU-Spray Bugspray\nhttp://www.bugspray.com\n1-800-877-7290\nAre these safe for use around wells? Concerned about well contamination.\nDuane,\nIf you have a shallow well, like 10 feet or less, I\u2019d say don\u2019t treat. But since most wells are 50-100 feet deep or more, there is no risk or potential for these products to get anywhere near the water supply unless you were to pour some directly down the well pipe. \nBasically our dust, granules and liquid materials can only go as deep as the nest and then another foot at most. But after that initial foot, they get filtered and broken down as the percolate down into the biomass. In the end, the chemical you apply will only penetrate maybe 6-12 inches beyond where you apply them.\nSo if the nest is 3 feet down in the ground and you were to drench it, the active chemical would only get another 6-12 inches deeper. Deeper penetration will happen over time but the chemical will be vastly changed and no longer a \u201cpesticide\u201d. \nAnd dusts don\u2019t go any deeper; they simply break down right away. Lastly, granules will penetrate another 3-6 inches at best since they have no volatility and are so weak. \nIn summary, the risks of water contamination are pretty much non existent these days unless you have a really high water table like one might have along a coastal property (meaning if you reside right on a lake or ocean and you\u2019re at the same water level).\nTechnical Support\nU-Spray Bugspray\nhttp://www.bugspray.com\n1-800-877-7290\nClick here to cancel reply.\nName:\n\nEmail:\n\nWebsite:\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\tnine \u2212  = 1\t\nTags: CICADA, Cicada Killer, cicada killer dust, cicada killer spray, Cicada killers, Cypermethrin, mulch, treatment, wasp, Wasp Freeze.\nCART CHECKOUT"], ["Cicada Killer Wasp - Cyberbee.net", "http://www.cyberbee.net/column/stinging/cicadakiller.shtml", "\n          Fig. 1. A cicada killer wasp trying to carry home a cicada that has \n          been paralyzed.\n\nFig. 2: The nesting hole and the soil dug out \n          by a cicada killer. Photos by Zachary Huang\n \nBehavior and biology Cicada killer wasps are solitary \n  wasps and have a life cycle very different from the social wasps such as hornets \n  and paper wasps.  The stings are designed to paralyze \n  cicadas rather than for nest defense, so despite their large size, the sting \n  is not as painful. The female wasps are not defensive, they will only sting \n  if caught by bare hand or caught in one's clothing. Males will chase after other \n  wasps or even buzz around humans, if one comes into their territory, but they \n  have no stings. Adult wasps emerge about mid July in Michigan and live for about \n  2 months. Adult wasps will dig nesting holes during July and August. Nesting \n  holes are usually in full sun, with sparse vegetation, in well-drained soils \n  that are sandy slightly clayey. The soil thrown out of the hole usually forms \n  a U-shaped open tunnel at the entrance (see Fig. 2 above). \n  Female wasps will make burrows that are about 6-10 inches deep and drag paralyzed \n  cicadas inside. A burrow may have 10 to 20 cells with each cell provided with \n  1-2 cicadas and one egg. Each female egg is provided with two cicadas and male \n  egg is provided with one cicada. Eggs hatch into larvae in two days and larvae \n  will consume the live but paralyzed cicadas in 4-14 days and then spin a coocoon. \n  The larvae then enter into a diapause. They pupate in the next spring and emerge \n  as asults mid July the next year, completing the full cycle. Female wasps will \n  locate singing cicadas and sting them to cause paralysis, then either glide \n  from a tree to their burrow or drag them to the burrow on the grass. \n Control and prevention  If you do not enjoy the singing \n  of cicadas during summer, then the cicada killer wasps are your friend. One \n  female wasp will hunt 10-30 cicadas per summer. However when they become too \n  abundant, especially near door steps, golf courses, or flower beds, people can \n  get annoyed or scared. The most effective control is to use a tennis rackets \n  to swat them like large flies, or one can capture them using insect nets. Because \n  the wasp only nests in areas with sparse vegetation, improving your lawn with \n  adequate watering and fertilizer will remove infestation after 1-2 years. If \n  one prefers to use pesticide, locate the burrows during day time and apply pesticide \n  after it is dark so the wasps are inside their burrows. Dusts such as bendiocarb \n  (Ficam), carbaryl (Sevin), or diazinon can be applied to the nest entrance directly. \n  If the density of burrows are high, consider spraying of the same type of insecticides. \n  One may need to treat continuously for 2-3 weeks if there is an influx of new \n  wasps from other places. If you are allergic to insect stings, have someone \n  help you or call a pest control firm listed in your yellow pages.\nDisclaimer: This fact sheet is for information only.

They are conspicuous insects, since the males are territorial and will butt or grapple with intruders including other males. There are 22 species of Sphecius Dahlbom in the world and all hunt cicadas as far as is known. Two of four Nearctic species of Sphecius occur in Florida. The females of the common Florida species, Sphecius speciosus (Drury), hunt Tibicen spp. cicadas and can dig 4-foot burrows in the ground with several branches and cells. The provisioning with cicadas is nearly specific to Sphecius in the family Sphecidae, but is known in a few other sphecids such as Liogorytes joergenseni (Brethes) from Argentina (Bohart and Stange 1976). \n  This biology is based on Sphecius speciosus.  Lin (1966) observed copulatory habits in these wasps. Usually, copulation was initiated while the wasps were on the ground, with the male  grasping the female from behind. Then the wasps would fly out with the female dragging the usually smaller male. Their  heads are diametrically opposed while in flight. However, both wasps used their wings in flight which can last up to 45 minutes.\r\n\n The fertilized female begins the reproductive cycle by making burrows 0.3 to 1.2 meters in length, with numerous branches and cells. The front legs rake the soil which is pushed out behind the female with her hind legs, resulting in a large dirt mound. The burrows are left open during provisioning and may never be closed. However, the cells are carefully closed when completed. From one to four cicadas per cell are deposited depending on the size of the cicada. \n The female paralyzes the host by stinging the membrane at the base of the foreleg, then carries the cicada venter to venter by dragging or flying to the nest. One egg is placed on the last cicada in each nest. Apparently, the mother wasp can determine the sex of the egg and places the female egg with the more abundant provisions.  Lin and Michener (1972) saw up to four females of S. speciosus provisioning a single nest simultaneously which may indicate a step toward sociality. \n  1.

Photograph by Division of Plant Industry.\n\n  This wasp is widely distributed east of the Rocky Mountains and south into Mexico. Sometimes common locally in Florida especially during the summer months where many wasps may nest together gregariously.  Human encounters with this giant wasp are only seemingly dangerous since usually it is the stingless male which is the aggressor.  The four foot burrows may have more than 16 cells which contain one to two cicadas each of many species of Tibicen.  The wasps are parasitized by sarcophagid flies (Senotainia trilineata (Wulp); Metopia argyrocephala (Meigen)) and possibly mutillid wasps.\r\n  \n \nFigure 2. Sphecius speciosus (Drury), a cicada killer wasp.\r\n    Photograph by Division of Plant Industry.\n\u00a0\n  Cicada killers are usually considered beneficial insects since they destroy plant feeding cicadas. Also, they rarely sting except when the females are handled. However, under certain circumstances such as when elderly persons or young children are present in the breeding areas one may want to discourage their presence. This can be done by eliminating or reducing the breeding area which usually consists of exposed, sandy soil. This area can be mulched or covered with grass. Labeled insecticides can be applied to the nesting sites to kill the wasps.\r\n"], ["Cicada Killer Wasp and Other Digger Wasps | Iowa Insect ...", "http://www.ipm.iastate.edu/ipm/iiin/bdigwas.html", "At least 3 different species of wasps construct nests in the ground in Iowa. These \"digger wasps\" include the cicada killer wasp, the largest wasp found in Iowa. Cicada killer wasps may be up to 2 inches long. They are black with yellow markings on the thorax and abdomen and they have rusty colored wings. The great golden digger wasp is slightly smaller. The abdomen is reddish-orange except at the tip which is black. A third species is 1 inch long and completely black with iridescent blue wings. \nThe cicada killer wasp and other digger wasps are solitary wasps; that is, they live independently rather than in colonies and do not depend on other members of a colony to share in the raising of young or the maintaining of a nest. Other solitary wasps include the mud daubers and potter wasps. Solitary wasps put paralyzed insects or spiders inside the nest as food for their offspring. \nFemale cicada killer wasps capture annual cicadas in July and August and place them in cells located at the ends of tunnels they have dug in the ground. Each tunnel is about the size of a quarter and extends 24 inches or more into the ground. One or two paralyzed cicadas are placed in each cell, and a single egg deposited before the cell is closed by the female, who flies away, never to return. The wasp grubs feed on the cicadas and develop into wasps that emerge the following summer. \nThe cicada killer, like other solitary wasps, has the capability to sting, but won't unless handled or threatened. Only female wasps have the ability to sting. Stings inflicted by solitary wasps are usually not severe but reaction varies with each individual. \nWasps are generally beneficial and a nest in an out of the way location where it is not likely to be disturbed should be left alone. If, however, a nest is located where problems could arise, such as under a deck or near an often used door, removal is justified. Ground nests of cicada killers and other digger wasps can be destroyed by placing an outdoor use insecticide dust containing carbaryl in and around the nest entrance during the night. The dust particles will adhere to the wasps as they come and go from the nest. Cover the nest opening with a shovelful of soil after all activity has stopped.

Some wasps may be 1-1/4 inches long. \nThe cicada killer wasp occurs in all states east of the Rocky Mountains. It abounds in areas of full sun, scant vegetation, and light textured, well-drained soils. Poorly vegetated embankments seem to be favorite nesting sites. The cicada killer wasp does not feed on plants. Adult wasps feed on the nectar of flowers. They do, however, catch and sting adult cicadas to serve as food for their larvae during development. In spite of its formidable size and burrowing habit, this wasp is unusually docile and harmless. Though possibly capable of inflicting a painful sting, the cicada killer wasp is usually difficult to provoke. Mating males are aggressive and more easily disturbed, however, males cannot sting.\nA noticeable mound of soil surrounds the burrow of each cicada killer wasp. Since colonies of burrows are common, infested lawns usually contain several mounds that can smother the grass. However, since cicada killer wasps prefer to nest in areas of sparse vegetation, it is likely that an infested turf was already unthrifty when the wasps arrived. They rarely burrow in thick, vigorous turf.\nThe cicada killer wasp overwinters as a larva within a cocoon 3/4 to 1 inch deep in well drained soil. Pupation occurs in the spring. The cicada killer wasp\u2019s life history has not been closely studied in North Carolina, but this wasp appears as early as the first week of June in Arkansas, but rarely before July 1 in Ohio. Emergence continues throughout the summer. \nThe female adult feeds, mates, and digs burrows for several weeks before preying on cicadas. A vertical or slightly angled burrow 6 to 9 inches deep and 1/2 inch in diameter with broadly oval cells perpendicular to the main tunnel is excavated. The excess soil thrown out of the burrow forms a symmetrical, U-shaped mound at the entrance.\nOnce cells have been constructed, the search for cicada begins. Canvassing tree trunks and lower limbs, the wasp stings its prey, turns the victim on its back, straddles it, and drags it or glides with it to the burrow. Each cell is furnished with at least one cicada (sometimes two or three) and a single egg before being sealed off. Two to 3 days later the egg hatches. \nDepending on the number of cicadas in its cell, the larva feeds for 4 to 10 days until only the cicada\u2019s outer skin remains. During the fall, the larva spins a silken case, shrinks, and prepares to overwinter. Only one generation occurs per year. These can generally be considered beneficial insects.\nCultural practices can prevent or eliminate the establishment of cicada killer colonies. Adequate lime and fertilizer applications accompanied by frequent watering promote a thick growth of turf and can usually eliminate a cicada killer infestation in one or two seasons. Usually the perceived need for control is based in fear rather than fact. In case of a severe infestation, chemical control may be desired to prevent or allay fears of wasp stings.\n\n\nWas the information on this page helpful?\n Yes\n No\n\n\nCare to tell us why?\n\nSend Explanation\n\nFind more stories like: Agriculture & Food on Granville County Center, \u2014 or checkout all the other tags we use.\nNC Cooperative Extension is based at North Carolina's two land-grant institutions, NC State University and NC A&T State University, in all 100 counties and with the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians. \u2014 Read our commitment to diversity.\nRead our Privacy Statement\nNorth Carolina State University and North Carolina A&T State University commit themselves to positive action to secure equal opportunity regardless of race, color, creed, national origin, religion, sex, age, veteran status or disability.

These large solitary wasps are also known as Giant Cicada Killers or Sand Hornets. This last common name is a misnomer because they are not true hornets. Despite their very large size, dangerous appearance and \"dive-bombing\" habit, adults rarely contact people or sting. In fact, the \"dive-bombing\" male does not even have a stinger and is merely faking a fierce attack. The ovipositor of the female is a tubular egg-laying structure that can function as a very weak stinger. Her mild sting is similar in feel to a slight pin scratch and is not considered painful. Nonetheless, without accurate identification and knowledge, this menacing \"bluff\" often succeeds in causing fear, anxiety and occasional panic.\nFigure 1 \u2013 Cicada killer wasp attacking its prey.\nIdentification of this insect is fairly easy just judging on size alone. The adults range in size from 1\u00bd to 1\u00be inches in length for females and about 1 to 1\u00bc inches for males. Both sexes are strikingly colored black, red and yellow which is similar to the warning coloration of common social wasps like yellow jackets which do possess painful stingers. Cicada Killer Wasps have a thick-waisted black body that is striped with yellow across the middle section (thorax) and the first three segments of the rear section (abdomen). Most of the head and parts of the thorax are a dull red (see Fig. 1). All six legs are brightly colored an orangish-red. All four yellowish wings are held straight out when at rest, which is in contrast to most other wasps which fold their wings along their body.\nHomeowners, golfers and picnickers often becoe frightened when in close proximity to Giant Cicada Killers. These wasps can become an unwelcome nuisance as males constantly patrol their underground nesting sites. Male wasps may aggressively fly right up to people in defense of their nest even though they cannot sting. Females are less commonly observed but when captured or mishandled can inflict a mild sting. Her stinger is primarily used to paralyze prey and rarely used in defense except when trapped in clothing or disturbed by lawn equipment. If accidentally stung, there is no cause for alarm except for individuals who are especially sensitive to bee or wasp stings.\nFemale adults often dig their tunnels in a backyard sandbox, a sand trap on the golf course or in a nice sandy picnic area outdoors. Lawns, gardens, flower beds and athletic fields are other preferred nesting sites. They excavate noticeable amounts of soil around their tunnel entrances and create unsightly mounds. Large soil particles are removed with mouth parts and then shoveled through their legs in a dog-like manner.\nAggregations of individual tunnels can easily exceed 100 in number and last for many years. For these cosmetic and psychological reasons, the wasp could be considered a turfgrass pest, although this insect is essentially harmless.\nCicada Killer Wasps feed on tree sap and flower nectar as individual adults. Females fly around trees, shrubs, meadows and open areas in search of their only prey species\u2014Cicada species (see fact sheet FS220). The Cicada is used as food to rear the next generation of wasps. The female wasp strikes and stuns the Cicada which reacts with a loud shrieking buzz. Both of these very large insects tumble to the ground where the stinger is then utilized to paralyze the Cicada. This relatively huge prey is laboriously dragged up a tree or tall plant. The Cicada is often held upside down and straddled, after which the wasp takes off and glides home to the nest (Fig. 2).\nFigure 2 \u2013 Nest entrance opening.\nThe female drags the Cicada through the entrance opening, down the tunnel and into the nesting chamber. She oviposits an egg on the legs of the prey and seals off the cell. Wasp larvae hatch within a few days and penetrate the exoskeleton of the immobilized food source. Larvae feed on the internal tissues and overwinter as mature larvae within a tough, brown-colored cocoon. A monthlong pupation in June leads to adult emergence in July, completing the life cycle. Emergence overlaps with the main availability of the food supply for their nests. This next generation of adults will again dig tunnels, capture Cicadas and live two to three months from July to September.\nFemales dig 1-1\u00bd inch diameter tunnels about a foot deep and two feet long at an angle. At the bottom of the burrow a chamber is constructed with three or four earthen cells. Each cell is stocked with one or two prey for each larva. Additional chambers may be made off the main tunnel branch with additional cells. This nesting structure may house a dozen or more cells.\nControl measures are seldom required because Cicada Killer Wasps rarely sting people and only fly as adults for less than two months. If wasp numbers are high or the nests are located in a particularly sensitive area, several control methods have proven successful.\nWith low populations, an aggregation can be quickly eliminated with the use of a butterfly net or an accurate forearm smash with a tennis racket. Well-aimed aerosol insecticide sprays can repel and reduce patrolling male wasps. Eye, head and body protection is advisable in pursuing this direct capture and control approach. When several tunnels are situated together, a large clear plastic tarp will overheat the ground and deny access.\nWhen resorting to insecticides against the nesting sites, several compounds are available for the homeowner but dust formulations are the most effective. Applications should be made around and into the entrance hole just before sunset or before sunrise to work best as the female will unknowingly carry the toxicant to the brood chamber. Spray timing needs to be early in the lifecycle, generally in July, while the adult is still provisioning the nest after which larvae are sealed off from outside contact. The burrow entrance is the target and should remain open and not be filled in or disturbed. Active insecticidal ingredients include carbaryl (Sevin), bendiocarb (Ficam) and pyrethroids. Always read the label carefully and follow directions. See fact sheet FS212, \"Wasps and Their Control\", for more information.

But even they won t be able to keep up with the swarms coming.\nSeveral experts say that they really don't have a handle on how many cicadas are lurking underground but that 30 billion seems like a good estimate. At the Smithsonian Institution, researcher Gary Hevel thinks it may be more like 1 trillion.\nThey aren t returning everywhere in our area, just locations from around Lake Norman and north. areas along I-40 north have the best chance of seeing them.

They feed on flower nectar while the immature or larval stage feeds primarily upon cicadas that are brought to the burrow by adults.\nIn spite of their large size, the wasps usually ignore people, but they can give a painful sting if bothered. Mating males are aggressive and more easily disturbed.\nA mound of fine soil surrounds the burrow of each cicada killer. Because colonies of burrows are common, infested lawns usually contain several mounds that can smother grass. However, they prefer to nest in areas of sparse vegetation, and rarely infest thick, vigorous turf.\nCicada killers over-winter as larvae in the soil. Pupation occurs in the spring and adults emerge in mid-June to early July. Emergence continues throughout the summer. Females feed, mate and dig burrows for several weeks before preying on cicadas. Excess soil thrown out of the burrow forms a regular, U-shaped mound at the entrance.\nThe females search tree trunks and lower limbs for cicadas. The wasp stings its prey, turns the victim on its back, straddles it and drags it or glides with it to the burrow. Each cell is furnished with at least one cicada (sometimes two or three) and a single egg before being sealed off. Two to three days later the egg hatches.\nDepending on the number of cicadas in its cell, the larva feeds for 4 to 10 days until only the cicada\u2019s outer shell remains. During the fall, the larva spins a silken case, shrinks and prepares to overwinter. Only one generation occurs each year.\nCultivation practices can prevent or eliminate the establishment of cicada killer colonies. Adequate lime and fertilizer applications accompanied by frequent watering promote a thick growth of turf and can usually eliminate a cicada killer infestation in one or two seasons. In case of severe infestation, chemical control may be necessary to prevent danger from stinging wasps.\nEducational programs of the University of Kentucky Cooperative Extension Service serve all people regardless of race, color, age, sex, religion, disability or national origin.\nWe have sent a confirmation email to {* emailAddressData *}.

They are however only a minority in the genus, which includes over 200 species of Solenopsis worldwide. Solenopsis are stinging ants and most of their common names reflect this, for example, ginger ants and tropical fire ants. Many species also are called red ants because of their light brown colour, though species of ants in many other genera are similarly named for similar reasons. Examples include Myrmica rubra and Pogonomyrmex barbatus.[2]\nNone of these names applies in all countries nor to all species of Solenopsis, nor only to Solenopsis species; for example the colloquial names for several species of weaver ants in the genus Oecophylla in Southeast Asia include \"fire ants\" because of their red color and painful sting; the two genera however are not closely related.\n\n\nThe bodies of mature fire ants, like the bodies of all typical mature insects, are divided into three sections: the head, the thorax, and the abdomen, with three pairs of legs and a pair of antennae. Fire ants of those species invasive in the United States can be distinguished from other ants locally present, by their copper brown head and body with a darker abdomen. The worker ants are blackish to reddish, and their size varies from 2\u00a0mm to 6\u00a0mm (0.08 in to 0.24 in). In an established nest these different sizes of ants all are present at the same time.[citation needed]\nSolenopsis spp. ants can be identified by three body features\u2014a pedicel with two nodes, an unarmed propodeum, and antennae with 10 segments plus a two-segmented club.\nMany ants bite, and formicine ants can cause irritation by spraying formic acid; myrmecine ants like fire ants have a dedicated venom-injecting sting, which injects an alkaloid venom, as well as mandibles for biting.\nA typical fire ant colony produces large mounds in open areas, and feeds mostly on young plants, seeds and sometimes crickets. Fire ants often attack small animals and can kill them. Unlike many other ants, which bite and then spray acid on the wound, fire ants bite only to get a grip and then sting (from the abdomen) and inject a toxic alkaloid venom called Solenopsin, a compound from the class of piperidines. For humans, this is a painful sting, a sensation similar to what one feels when burned by fire (hence the name) and the after effects of the sting can be deadly to sensitive people.\nFire ants are more aggressive than most native species and so have pushed many species away from their local habitat. These ants are renowned for their ability to survive extreme conditions. They do not hibernate, but can survive cold conditions as low as -9\u00a0\u00b0C (16\u00b0 F) despite originating from South America.[3][unreliable source?]\nFire ants nest in the soil, often near moist areas, such as river banks, pond shores, watered lawns and highway shoulder. Usually, the nest will not be visible, as it will be built under objects such as timber, logs, rocks, or bricks. If there is no cover for nesting, dome-shaped mounds will be constructed, but these are usually only found in open spaces, such as fields, parks and lawns. These mounds can reach heights of 40\u00a0cm (15.7\u00a0in), and can also be as deep as 1.5 meters (5 feet).\nColonies are founded by small groups of queens or single queens. Even if only one queen survives, within a month or so, the colony can expand to thousands of individuals. Some colonies may be polygynous (having multiple queens per nest).[4]\nFire ant queens, the reproductive females in their colony, also are generally the largest. Their primary function is reproduction; fire ant queens may live as many as 6 to 7 years and can produce up to 3,500 eggs per day. That adds up to roughly 9 million eggs produced during a single queen's lifetime. Young, virgin fire ant queens have wings (as do male fire ants), but rip them off after mating.[citation needed]\nMales mate with the queen. They die immediately after mating.\nThere are other types of roles in an ant colony like the workers and the soldier ants. The soldier ants are known for their larger and more powerful mandibles while the worker takes care of regular tasks (the main tasks in a colony are caring for the eggs/larvae/pupae, cleaning the nest, and foraging for food).[citation needed]\nAlthough most fire ant species do not bother people and are not invasive, Solenopsis invicta, known in the United States as the red imported fire ant (or RIFA) is an invasive pest in many areas of the world, notably the United States, Australia, the Philippines, China and Taiwan. The RIFA was believed to have been accidentally introduced to these countries via shipping crates.[3][unreliable source?][5]\nIn the US the FDA estimates that more than US$5 billion is spent annually on medical treatment, damage, and control in RIFA-infested areas. Furthermore, the ants cause approximately $750 million in damage annually to agricultural assets, including veterinarian bills and livestock loss, as well as crop loss.[6] Over 40 million people live in RIFA-infested areas in the southeastern United States.[7] Between 30 and 60% of people living in fire ant-infested areas are stung each year.[8] Since September 2004 Taiwan has been seriously affected by the red fire ant. The US, Taiwan and Australia all have ongoing national programs to control or eradicate the species, but, except for Australia, none have been especially effective. In Australia, an intensive program costing A$175 million had reportedly by February 2007 eradicated 99% of fire ants from the sole infestation occurring in south-east Queensland[citation needed], however by July 2013 multiple sites west of Brisbane were confirmed, including the Lockyer Valley, Muirlea and Goodna[9]\nAccording to a study published in 2009, it only took seventy years for the lizards in parts of the United States to adapt to the ant's presence \u2013 they now have longer legs and new behaviors that aid them in escaping from the danger.[10]\nThe venom of fire ants is composed of alkaloids derived from piperidine (see Solenopsis saevissima). Some people are allergic to the venom, and as with many allergies, may experience anaphylaxis, which requires emergency treatment. Other problems are concentrated to the site of the sting.\nThe sting swells into a bump, which can cause much pain and irritation, especially when several stings are in the same place. The bump often forms into a white pustule, which can become infected if scratched, but if left alone will usually flatten within a few days. The pustules are obtrusive and uncomfortable while active and, if they become infected, can cause scarring.[11]\nFirst aid for fire ant stings includes external treatments and oral medicines. There are also many home remedies of varying efficacy, including immediate application of urine or aloe vera gel, the latter of which is also often included in over-the-counter creams that also include medically tested and verified treatments.\nExternal, topical treatments include the anesthetic benzocaine, the antihistamine diphenhydramine, and the corticosteroid hydrocortisone.[12] Antihistamines or topical corticosteroids may help reduce the itching[citation needed].\nOral medicine include antihistamines.[citation needed]\nSevere allergic reactions to fire ant stings, including severe chest pain, nausea, severe sweating, loss of breath, serious swelling, and slurred speech,[13] can be fatal if not treated.\nPhorid flies, or Phoridae, are a large family of small, hump-backed flies somewhat smaller than vinegar flies; two species in this family (Pseudacteon tricuspis and Pseudacteon curvatus) are parasitoids of the red imported fire ant in its native range in South America. Some 110 species of the genus Pseudacteon, or ant-decapitating flies, have been described. Members of Pseudacteon reproduce by laying eggs in the thorax of the ant. The first instar larvae migrates to the head, then develops by feeding on the hemolymph, muscle tissue, and nervous tissue. After about two weeks, they cause the ant's head to fall off by releasing an enzyme that dissolves the membrane attaching the ant's head to its body. The fly pupates in the detached head capsule, emerging two weeks later.[14]\nPseudacteon flies appear to be important ecological constraints on Solenopsis species and they have been introduced throughout the southern United States, starting with Travis, Brazos, and Dallas counties in Texas, as well as Mobile, Alabama, where the ants first entered North America.\nThe Venus flytrap, a carnivorous plant, is native to North and South Carolina in the United States. About 33% of the prey of the Venus Flytrap are ants of various species. They lure their prey with a sweet sap. Once the prey has entered the trap and within about 30 seconds has touched two or three \"trigger hairs\", bristles on the surface of the trap, the leaf closes around the prey, confining it behind the \"teeth\" on its perimeter, and digests it. Other carnivorous plants, such as Sundews (Drosera) and various kinds of pitcher plants also trap many ants, but in contrast to the effectiveness of relevant species of Phorid flies, there is no evidence that predation by carnivorous plants is in practice a significant drain on populations of Solenopsis species.\nThe genus contains over 200 species.[1] They include:"], ["Fire Ants", "http://fireant.tv/", "Fire ant directory information  is divided into three main sections:\nFire ants are nasty, stinging, swarming ants. Every year they cost Americans more than $6 Billion in property damage, hospital trips, skin treatments and fire ant control efforts. Because of their attraction to electricity, fire ants are responsible for knocking out street lights, airport runway lights and countless household electrical devices. Every year, fire ant swarms delivering  potent  venom  through their stingers, kill pets, small animals and a number of unfortunate humans.\nThe red imported fire ant was introduced to the US in the 1930s. Fire ants have since spread  to cover most of the Gulf Coast states,   eastern Texas and parts of California. Fire ants  nest in the soil and construct hills or mounds that are easily identifiable in lawns and pastures. A single lawn may contain a dozen or more fire ant hills. Fire ants also create mounds  within landscape mulch and beneath  landscape timbers or under walkway slabs.. These  mounds may be largely hidden from view making them difficult to detect, hampering fire ant control efforts.\nFire ant control  has become increasingly important as fire ant mounds  pop up in the spring and early summer months. Control of fire ants can  often lead to nasty fire ant bites. Because of this, most people  contemplate killing fire ants as quickly and completely as they can.  Many fire ant elimination products, both organic and non-organic  are available for purchase in the Fire Ant Products Store.\n Fire Ant Elimination - Fire ants are widespread in the southern US. Three types of fire ants  are most common: southern fire ants, imported fire ants, and red  imported fire ants. All of these species are significant threats to  humans due to their very painful and venomous stings.  One effective way of killing fire ants is the use of fire ant bait.  There are a number of recommended products on the market. Traditional  fire ant bait uses strong toxic chemicals that may may harm wildlife  (birds, dogs etc.). Newer organic bait is becoming more mainstream, is  very effective, and is safe for wildlife. Fire ant elimination using  bait is most effective with regular use in order to prevent a  re-infestation.  Controlling fire ants using bait is very easy. Being careful not to be  stung, spread the bait liberally on and near the fire ant mound. The  fire ants will then carry the bait (thinking it is food) back to the  colony to share it with the entire ant population. Most baits work,  killing fire ants within 72 hours of initial application.\nFire ant bites are very painful and need special care to assure they are not infected. We cover all  details of fire ant bite reactions and treatment. \nFire ant elimination and killing fire ants are simple with the right tools. We have a complete line-up of organic and non-organic fire ant control products. We offer fire ant bait, bait spreaders, and dry and liquid mound treatments for drenching fire ant hills.\nWe also offer a number of fire ant bite treatment:. Hydrocortisone for pain and itch, Antihistamines to temper allergic reactions and a number of special fire ant creams.\nRed imported fire ants are native to South America. They were introduced to the US in the 1930's and despite massive fire ant control efforts have managed to spread to about 1/3 of the US. They are known for their painful sting and lightning fast swarming ability. Red imported fire ants are extremely aggressive and known for their speedy migration from one location to another. This is a key component in red imported fire ant elimination efforts. It is important to initially treat a wide area with fire ant bait prior to treating individual mounds.

They sting\n        and it hurts! \nFire ants bite as well, grasping the skin with their mandibles to anchor themselves and better insert their sting. The bite is of no lasting consequence, but the venom they inject through their sting is quite potent, especially in relation to their size. Unlike the sting of the honey bee, the sting of the fire ant is not barbed, and an individual worker can sting repeatedly and still survive to return to her normal duties. \nInitially, there is a sharp localized pain. Within about 24 hours a raised white pustule forms at the site, and this will persist for many days. Despite the appearance of this pustule, it is not infected. Stings can cause localized pain and/or itching for several days, and they can potentially become infected, especially if broken open by scratching or other causes. The potential for secondary problems is greater in people suffering from medical problems, such as diabetes or compromised immune systems.\nFor most people a single fire ant sting is a \u2018mildly painful\u2019 experience that would quickly be forgotten were it not for the \u2018mildly irritating\u2019 pustule. Unfortunately, a stinging encounter with fire ants usually involves more than one ant, and each year many people have the experience of being stung by dozens, or even hundreds, of fire ants. The pain and irritation associated with a single sting is multiplied many fold in such incidents. Most people recover from such encounters with no lasting ill effects, and it is only when such stinging incidents involve many hundreds or thousands of stings that they become truly threatening. But incidents of this magnitude do occasionally occur, usually involving people who are less mobile due to age, accident or infirmity.\nAlthough a few fire ant stings do not constitute a medical emergency for most people, a very small percent of people develop allergic reactions to fire ant venom. These vary in intensity, but in the most extreme cases even a few stings can result in the life-threatening condition known as anaphylaxis. Each year there are cases of human fatalities resulting from fire ant stings, either due to anaphylaxis or to massive numbers of stings occurring on people who are incapacitated.\nGiven the pain and discomfort that can result from even a few fire ant stings, it is fortunate that fire ants do not normally aggressively seek out and attack human beings. The vast majority of stinging events occur when people inadvertently \u2018attack\u2019 the fire ants, usually by unknowingly stepping in, lying in, or otherwise disturbing the mound. The ants perceive this disturbance as a direct attack and the workers quickly react en masse to defend their colony. \n\nLesion Development:\nImages below will change every four seconds showing thumbnail sized photos of a person's finger after a fire ant sting:\n\n  AC_FL_RunContent( 'codebase','http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=9,0,28,0','width','420','height','148','title','Photos of a person\\'s finger after a fire ant sting.','src','images/sting/flash_stuff/ant','quality','high','pluginspage','http://www.adobe.com/shockwave/download/download.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash','movie','images/sting/flash_stuff/ant' ); //end AC code         \nContact\nDr. Blake Layton, Extension Entomology Specialist\n        Department of Entomology, Mississippi State University\n        Phone: (662) 325-2085\n      Email: blayton@entomology.msstate.edu \nThis page was last updated on August 21, 2014.\n\n  \n      <!--\n      {\n       document.write(location.href);\n      }\n      // -->\n        \n\n      Web page information: webmaster@ext.msstate.edu\nLegal | Ethics Line\nPolicy about commercial\n          endorsements.\nDAFVM | USDA | eXtension | Site Map | Extension\n      Intranet"], ["Fire Ants: Red Fire Ant Control & Facts - Orkin.com", "http://www.orkin.com/ants/fire-ant/", "Share this page:\nSolenopsis invicta\nReddish, about 1.6 to 5 mm. Read more about  identification of fire ants.\nTypically nest in the ground. At times, nests may appear as visible mounds of 61 cm in diameter and about 18 cm high. Large colonies can have up to 250,000 workers. Very active and aggressive, they will sting any intruding animal repeatedly.\nFire ants are omnivorous. Known to eat meats, greasy and sweet materials. Fire ants are omnivores, meaning they will feed on animal or vegetable sources of food.  The fire ant worker\u2019s diet includes insects, earthworms, ticks, spiders, arthropod eggs, honeydew and other sweets.  Plant sources of food include seeds.  Young and newborn vertebrate animals eaten by fire ants include birds, rodents and calves.  Generally, fire ants readily consume carrion (dead animals) regardless of whether the fire ants themselves caused the animal to die.  Fire ant larvae are fed by the worker adults and eat only a liquid diet until their third larval instar is complete. Fourth instar larvae are capable of digesting solid foods.  \nTotal time from egg to adult averages 30 days; workers may live up to 180 days; queens live two to six years.\nOne common sign of fire ant activity is the worker and swarmer ants. Other signs can be their sandy earthen mounds, which are usually more visible after recent rainfall, or the complaints of customers who are being stung by ants.\nThough not a native species in North America, the red imported fire ant has become a common nuisance throughout the southern United States, ranging from Florida to California and as far north as Oklahoma and Virginia.\u00a0The red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta) was accidentally brought into the United States in the 1930s via a shipment of cargo. Initially transplanted into Alabama, they have spread and thrived throughout the southern states with the warm climate and lack of predators.\nFire ants favor warm, sunny conditions. They prefer dry fields and avoid shady areas such as woods. Typical mounds can grow up to 61 cm in diameter and 18 cm high. These colonies can contain several hundred thousand ants, including at least one  queen.\nWhen attacking, fire ants first use their mandibles to grip their prey, and then inject venom through a stinger.  Fire ant stings are painful for most humans and fatal to some: if a victim experiences a severe reaction such as sweating, nausea or excessive itching, emergency medical services should be contacted immediately. Their sting, which includes alkaloid venom, is highly irritating to humans and results in red bumps and white pustules, which can ultimately lead to scarring. The sensation of a fire ant burn has been described as \u201cstinging\u201d and \u201cintense burning,\u201d and fire ants are known to attack potential threats or prey in large numbers. A fire ant colony may contain 100,000 to 500,000 insects, thus increasing the likelihood that multiple stings will be inflicted.\nYour local pest control professional should be contacted in the event of fire ant activity. Professionals can manage lawn infestations while securing homes against indoor invasions.\nThe most reliable method of fire ant treatment is to have your local pest control company perform an inspection and determine how to manage the fire ants in your home.\nTo avoid bites or stings outside the home, be cautious and observant where you step, sit or place items such as food or drinks. If you see a fire ant mound, keep an eye on the ground to watch for ant activity.\n\u00a0\n\n\t\tGive us a call:\n        \n844-514-3980\n\n\nOr schedule a call with an Orkin Specialist today and get a FREE estimate for:\n\n\t\tThis branch appears close by:\n\t\t\n\n,  \n\n\nNot in ?\n\t\tEnter a zip code below to view local branches.\n\nHave been known to remove rubber insulation from telephone wires; sting is painful and can kill young wildlife.\nLearn to identify this pest with these helpful pictures.\nSee more photos here \n\n\u00a0"], ["Twenty Questions About Fire Ants - University of Arkansas ...", "http://www.uaex.edu/publications/pdf/FSA-7052.pdf", ""], ["Fire ants: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia", "http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002843.htm", "Fire ants are red-colored insects that sting and deliver a harmful substance, called venom, into your skin.\nThis is for information only and not for use in the treatment or management of an actual poison exposure.

Not only does the use of proper social media tools and apps help emerging businesses take advantage of online visibility, but it can also aid existing companies bounce two or three stories up faster than their managers could imagine was possible.\nSocial media aggregators stand for the generic name given to the array of popular social network services everyone is using right now. These aggregators play the role of important information collectors. They are responsible for pulling together viable social media information into just one location. Companies using these aggregators get to keep informed on the type of products and new service offerings their potential prospects might be looking for.\nTWITTER IPO 2013!\n\nThey get to rely their decisions on complex actions that involve RSS feeds featured on several social networks at a time, collect new friends and followers and turn them into clients, combine bookmarks and accurately consolidate messages, keep track of the times their company\u2019s name is mentioned in the online environment and do all this with the help of some special social media tools and widgets they can easily find on the Internet.\nThe price of these tools and applications usually does not go through the roof and some of them are free of charge. So whenever a company is not fully satisfied with the services that a certain social media aggregator is providing it with, the respective company is recommended to keep exploring its options. There is an impressively wide range of choices to look into and the ever-evolving social media environment is forcing clever IT minds to add value to each upcoming social media aggregator, for competitiveness reasons.\nA business manager looking to considerably simplify the overall all-too-complicated social media experience of a company can read the product info all of these aggregators come accompanied by and make a clever decision. Online forums where folks are recommending or advising against these aggregators could also stand for some reliable sources of information at times, especially for the inexperienced.\nSuccessfully managing content across several networks under the same generous umbrella and hence incorporating social media into a blooming business all depends on the efficiency and accuracy of a social media aggregator. Some aggregators will personalize trending topics online, others will constantly keep an eye on Internet users\u2019 interests and needs in terms of information, some will carefully analyze comments and messages and other will even incorporate thoughtful social feed streams and useful bookmarks.\nAll in all, the success of a business relies on the type of tools it uses to make itself and its products and services seen, heard of and talked about. No matter if your name is Frank Bobby and you are simply considering launching a new online T-shirt printing business or you are an experienced furniture company looking to get more out of your social media visibility, social media aggregators are the right impact tools you should make full use of.\nA lot of ink has been spilled over the matter of using social media means as promoting or boosting one\u2019s business. Social media web sites such as Facebook, Google Plus, or Twitter have also been attentively analyzed for their powerful role as information sources, as well as for their ability to cause negative impacts and lead to obsessive-compulsive behaviors online. Shortly put, there are both pros and cons that should be mentioned in relation to social media, and you can check it out following the lines below.\nMore and more people are creating social media accounts, wishing to stay connected to everything occurring around them on a 24/7 basis. Social media is also the breaking ground of promoting one\u2019s business worldwide, and you can now find and compare several accredited nurse practitioner schools, instead of choosing to visit that place or the other and spend a great deal of time doing unnecessary travelling. You can also check out the Facebook page of your favorite cosmetics\u2019 brand and see if you can find your favorite natural hair products or coconut oil for skin you can purchase online. You can also keep in touch with your friends and long-distance siblings, chat, share photos, videos, thoughts and wishes in real-time. All of these are to be considered the strongest pros of using social media.\nPlus, the tweets originating from trustworthy information sources informing you of the latest local or worldwide news are now successfully replacing your regular information sources such as the news or online newspapers. Today, information reaches you via social media platforms, and you no longer need to go on a hunt for it on a daily basis. This is probably one of the biggest advantages of inserting social media into your daily routine.\nInformation continues to be the key to success, so, so far, so good. But the amount of time millions of folks tend to spend online is the disturbing factor we should mention here. The social media bug can be caught by a lot of people, and the gap between normality and social media addiction is not that large and hard to cross.\nTeenagers and young adults altogether are the main targeted individuals, as they are most interested in being hyperactive and keeping in touch with all the important events worldwide. If we are to mention to case of the Boston Marathon bombing and the misleading information that has been leaked to the public, or other similar unfortunate events such as the death hoax cases that have involved celebrities worldwide and which have caused psychological damage similar to car accident negligence, we can see why social media is also faulty.  \nWhile you can easily buy some serviced apartments London via Facebook contacts, you can also be bullied via social media platforms, so, without drawing the fine line between the pros and the cons, social media can prove to be a tool that is hard to control.\nWe live in the world in which everyone is connected to everyone else. However, I once read a quote somewhere which said something like go into the forest; you won\u2019t find an internet connection there but I promise you will connect better. This small and very simple quote managed to capture my attention greatly. It is true, nowadays the only place where we may not have access to a goo internet connection may be a deserted spot in a forest or out in the middle of the ocean. Everywhere else seems to have a good wifi connection! Go to the malls, you will find access to the internet so that you can \u2018check in\u2019 an let your friends know that you are having a great time.  Restaurants also have wifi enabled. If you happen to go somewhere without a wifi connection, you can simply turn on the mobile internet service provided by your operator! Going online is therefore no longer a problem at all. Now you wouldn\u2019t just go online because you want o surf the internet in a public place; mostly people surf the internet at home! The main reason why one wants to go online is because he or she has a massive circle of \u2018friends\u2019 on any one or more of the many social networking websites present. Today, I will discuss the different roles that such sites are playing these days.\nThe social media is often filled with details of an individual\u2019s life that should not be disclosed to the hundreds of \u2018friends\u2019 that a person has on these platforms. You see, some information is either too personal or too trivial to be shared with everyone an individual knows. The concept of privacy seems to be nonexistent in the present world; everyone seems to know where you are, what you are doing and how you feel. Relationships have been strained because of such actions; fights have broken out among friends over petty issues generated from the social media. We live in a world where people deem it important even if they have health problems like sciatica pain. What people fail to understand is that some things are better left unpublicized. Such details about one\u2019s life are not for show; they should only be shared with close friends and family.\nSpeaking of close friends and family, often people have others added in their social network streams when they aren\u2019t even acquaintances. You see, someone you once spoke to on a bus simply does not qualify to be added to your circle. You see, you can delude yourself by the statistics on your social media sites that you have hundreds of friends. That random man standing next to a shiny automobiles may be someone you meet at the grocer\u2019s daily, however, that does not make that person a friend! One must understand that in times of need, none of these friends turn up leaving the individual broken and confused.\nIt is true that the social media has brought massive changes to our lifestyle and that it does have several benefits. However, the destruction caused by social media is a lot more than the benefits it gives.\nIt is sometimes easy to forget about the little critters of the microscopic world. Crawling around in a tiny world, so intricately connected to our own, are over 900 million different species of insect.\nSome of the most profound, and interesting species are the ants, and there is no shortage of them! There are over 12,000 known species of ants and the total biomass of all the ants in the world is believed to be roughly equal to the biomass of humans; scientists estimate that for every human alive, there are 1.5 million of them!\nOne particular type of ant, probably caught most of our attentions when we were very young; the fire ant (or to clarify; ants of the solenopsis genome). Many of us probably had our first encounter in the form of a sharp burning sensation when we sat in the way of one; hence the name \u201cfire ant\u201d. Yes, the fire ant is perhaps most notorious for it\u2019s brutal sting.\nOther ants tend to bite and then spray venom into the wound. The fire ant bites only to grip on, and then injects a venom through a sting in the abdomen. The venom is an alkaline compound containing solenopsin. The effect is painful for humans, and often fatal for other insects.\nInterestingly, this particular alkaline has been used in homeopathic therapies, and has recently had scientific light shed on it to reveal it\u2019s qualities as an antibacterial, insecticidal, anti fungal, and anti-HIV properties. The fire ant might be paying us back for it\u2019s stings. That\u2019s better than the deals on nomorerack.\nAnother claim to fame made by a certain fire ant, the Solenopsis invicta has another claim to fame; it is said to cause an estimated $5 billion in damages per year to North America, in medical treatment, damage, and control. These is an invasive fire ant species which is said to arrived by boat in the early 1900\u2032s.\nBut there is much more to the fire ant than it\u2019s distinguishable sting, and it\u2019s ability to run up a whopping bill with the FDA. Like other ants, the societies they form are vast and complex, hierarchical and efficient, and there is much scientific interest around them.\nTo nest, the fire ant produces large mounds, sometimes in open areas. They feed off plants, seeds, other insects like crickets, and sometimes small animals, which they are capable of attacking, and sometimes killing and eating.\nColonies are founded by queen ants, who can give birth to an expansive population in a matter of months. Their primary focus is breeding, and they can lay up to 3,500 eggs in a single day. They live for around 6 or 7 years; much longer than any ant workers or males. That makes for a lot of eggs, perhaps as many as 9 million in a queen\u2019s lifetime.\nThe workers, and soldiers, in the colony are born sterile, to the reproductive process of the queen. The workers tend to take care of the everyday tasks around the nest, including foraging for food, taking care of the larvae, and cleaning the nest. The soldiers are bigger, stronger ants, which have powerful mandibles.\nThere are male ants in the fire ant societies, and their role is mate with the queen. Before anyone starts thinking this is the easy job, the male seems only to live for reason of this mating; he dies shortly afterwards.\nThe males, and the queen, interestingly, have been shown to be born to a \u201ccloning\u201d process. Where workers are born to normal reproductive processes on the part of the queen, daughter queens are always clonally produced. This increases the queens relatedness to reproductive daughters but potentially damages the males reproductive success. As a result of this the male has developed a response by reproducing clonally too! They achieve this, it is suggested, by eliminating the maternal half of the genome in diploid eggs.\nPerhaps even more bizarrely, some colonies of fire ants have only one queen, known as a monogyne queen, and some societies involve multiple queens, aptly named a polygyne colony. The two colonies have also been shown to display differences in behaviour, with the monogyne acting more aggressively, and territorially, killing any queen that tries to attach itself to the colony. The polygene colonies, on the other hand, accepts strangers, including new queens to help colonize.\nWhether you love them, or hate them, the fire ant is a fascinating creature. With social and political structures that seem as complex as our own, stinging venoms that could become potential cures, and strange genetic behaviours that are leaving scientists baffled, the fire ant earns it\u2019s right to be king of the insects."], ["Fire Ants Kill - National Geographic", "http://video.nationalgeographic.com/video/fire-ants-predation", ""], ["FIREANT STUDIO: Full Service Digital Design Agency ...", "http://fireantstudio.com/", "LiveWell Colorado Childhood Obesity CampaignResponsive, Interactive Solution\nDavis Partnership Website RedesignWordPress, Responsive\nMesa CountyAnimal ServicesWordPress, API integration\nSwingle Landscape CareFull Website RedesignWordPress, Responsive\nWyoming Tourism\r\nInteractive Winter Guide Book\r\nParallax, Responsive \nLiveWell ColoradoGet Movin' ChallengeStatewide CampaignReal Time Leaderboard Data, Social Integration\nSkribbee!\r\nMultiUser meeting tool\r\nDesktop, iPad, iPhone\nLiveWell Colorado\r\nLive Well At Work Campaign\r\nResponsive, Wordpress\nImpossibleTV\r\nEngaging rich media experience\r\nResponsive, Wordpress\nLeopard\r\nInteractive and engaging\r\nResponsive, Wordpress\nNovo Coffee\r\nEcommerce Solution\r\nResponsive, Wordpress\nLiveWell Colorado\r\nGet Moving Challenge Campaign\r\nResponsive, Wordpress\nDenver Web Development Agency Blog Roll\nRemaining a smaller company has allowed FIREANT to remain flexible yet adept enough to work on large projects.

"], ["Fire Ant Frequently Asked Questions | Texas Imported Fire ...", "http://fireant.tamu.edu/manage/faq/", "What are red imported fire ants? What makes them different from Texas native ants?\nRed imported fire ants or Solenopsis invicta are medium-sized red and black colored ants that build mounds of soft soil. Mounds are rarely larger than 18\u2033 in diameter. In cold, dry areas such as the High Plains of Texas, mounds are usually much smaller and harder to detect. When disturbed, fire ants emerge aggressively, crawling up vertical surfaces, biting and stinging \u201call at once\u201d. Their sting usually leaves a white pustule on the skin. Worker fire ants vary in size from small (1/16 inch) to large (almost \u00bc inch) in length. Many native ant species have worker ants that are uniform in size and may vary in body color. Other small to medium-sized ants that build small nests in soil often have central nest openings through which the ants enter and leave whereas fire ants mounds have no central openings.\nHarvester ants are much larger and make large bare areas with a single entrance hole to the colony.\nLeafcutter ants are also much larger and have a distinctive built-up dense cluster of mounds at the colony\u2019s center called a \u201ctown\u201d, and have many entrance holes over a very large area.\nCan I tell the difference between fire ants and native ants? How large are fire ants?\n\nSome uncertainty comes from the fact that red imported fire ants vary in size (1/16 to almost 1/4 inch long \u2013 see image by S. D. Porter, USDA-ARS), with the largest workers 2 or 3 times larger than the smallest. Red imported fire ants are an exotic invasive species and in many areas of Texas they have displaced other species of fire ants native to the state. \u00a0Solenopsis geminata, the tropical fire ant, is the most common native fire ant species encountered. To the unaided eye, they are almost identical to red imported fire ants. However, S. geminata will have a few larger workers with large, square-shaped bi-lobed heads. These ants specialize in collecting and milling seeds, but build mounds similar to red imported fire ants.\nWhat is the difference between single queen and multiple queen forms of the red imported fire ant?\nThere are two genetically distinct forms or the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta: The single queen or monogyne form and the multiple queen or polygyne form.\nSingle queen (monogyne form): only one queen (reproductively active wingless female) per colony or mound; slightly larger worker ants; members of colonies are territorial; mounds generally larger in size; mound densities usually less than 300 mounds per acre; fewer ants per acre.\nMultiple queen (polygyne form): more than one and up to hundreds of unrelated queens per colony; smaller average worker ants; worker ants move freely from one mound to another and share resources; mound densities greater than 300 mound per acre; more ants per acre.\nHow can I tell the difference between fire ants and termites?\nAlthough most ants are recognizable, some forms of winged ants are often confused with termites, especially during the termite swarming season. The front pair of wings on ants is larger than the hind pair, while the four wings of termites are approximately the same size. Ants have \u201celbowed\u201d antennae and a \u201cthin waist\u201d (narrow between the thorax and first abdominal segments). In termites, the thorax and abdomen are broadly connected and their antennae are straight and hair-like.\nWhat are carpenter ants and how do I control them?\nCarpenter ants are usually larger than most other house-infesting ants. They vary in color from a dull black or reddish yellow color to a combination of black and dull red or reddish orange. Worker ants range in size from 5/16 to 7/16 inches long. Carpenter ants tunnel into wood to form nest galleries. If they go unnoticed for several years, some species of carpenter ants may cause significant structural damage. In Texas, carpenter ant species are more of a nuisance when they forage indoors, often attracted to sweet foods. Species may nest in almost any crack and crevice and often occur in structural wood where water leaks or rot occurs. Outdoors, the ants use dead trees or tree limbs, stumps, logs or areas under stones as nesting sites. Once the carpenter ant nest has been located, control is relatively easy. Nests can also be removed and infested wood replaced, if feasible. Treatment options include use of a bait or residual contact insecticide applied as a dust or spray to the nest. It may be necessary to drill small holes in wall voids, baseboards, window and door sills to apply insecticides to the nest or major part of the colony, procedures best done by a professional pest management provider. Read and follow the product label for best results.\nFor more information, read Texas Pest Ant Identification: an Illustrated \u201cKey\u201d (010) [PDF]\nWhere do fire ants come from?\nRed and black imported fire ants (Solenopsis invicta, and S. richteri) are native to South America. They were accidentally introduced into \u00a0the U.S. around the 1930\u2032s through the port of Mobile, Alabama; probably in soil used for ships\u2019 ballasts \u00a0and have been spreading since. There are several Solenopsis fire ant species native to the U.S.\nWe didn\u2019t used to have fire ants when I was a kid. Why do we have them now?\nRed imported fire ants are a very aggressive, efficient competitor ant species. Since the 1950\u2032s in Texas, the ant has been spreading north, west and south. They now infest the more than the eastern two-thirds of the state, and some urban areas in western Texas. The bad news is that they are probably here to stay. The good news is that, with relatively little cost and effort, you can prevent most of the problems they cause using currently available methods. Research efforts can result in even more cost-effective, environmentally sound fire ant management systems.\nAre fire ants still moving west and north?\nYes, and south, too. They have spread west to eastern New Mexico (Donna Anna County) and have crossed the Rio Grande River into northern Mexico. Their northward spread has reached the middle of Oklahoma where their survival depends on freezing soil temperature conditions. Cold winters tend to push them back. Western spread is largely dependent on availability of surface or ground water. However, with human assistance they have begun to infest parts of California where they are found mostly in urban areas, creek bottoms and irrigated land.\nWhy do fire ants appear to sting at the same time?\nFire ants are sensitive to vibration or movement and tend to sting when the object they are on moves. For example, when fire ants swarm up a person\u2019s leg, the person jerks or moves. Usually, whatever causes one ant to bite and stings triggers the other ants to sting to the same response. Although fire ants emit communication chemicals, called pheromones, to elicit specific behaviors (alarm reaction, trail formation, queen recognition pheromones have been documented), there is no known pheromone stimulating ants to bite and sting.\nAre fire ant stings lethal?\nOnly a very small portion of the population, around 1%, are hypersensitive to ant venom and will experience lethal allergic reactions. Very young and old people and those with suppressed immune systems are most likely to react severely to one or more stings. However, even healthy individuals may experience severe reactions such as anaphylactic shock if they suffer from a multiple stinging incident.\nWhat should I do if I get stung by fire ants?\nThere isn\u2019t much you can do, except watch the affected area for excessive swelling, itching or redness, or other symptoms like shortness of breath, thickening of the tongue, sweating, etc. that could indicate a severe systemic allergic reaction. If this occurs, seek medical attention. Otherwise treat stings as you would stings of other insects and keep them clean and intact to avoid secondary infections.\n\nWhat if I have an allergic reaction to a fire ant sting?\nSeek medical help immediately! If you are uncertain how your body will react, be sure to let someone know what has happened. It is best to be with other people that can assist you, if necessary.\nAre fire ants as lethal as killer bees?\nThis is kind of like comparing apples to oranges. They both attack en masse and can both cause fatal allergic reactions, but that\u2019s where the similarities end. Africanized bees can overwhelm and kill even healthy non-allergic people, but encounters are rather rare. Fire ants can\u2019t overwhelm a healthy, mobile person and even hundreds of stings are rarely fatal. But, fire ant mounds are extremely common. The chance of being killed by bees is higher if you encounter them, but the chance of being killed by fire ants is greater only if you are highly allergic, or cannot quickly get away from them. The chance of either is small.\nFire ants are killing the quail, deer, lizards, songbirds, horn toads, etc. Why isn\u2019t anything being done?\nThings are being done, but it\u2019s not an easy problem to solve. First, using today\u2019s chemical methods of imported fire ant control provide only temporary suppression and, on a per area basis, costs money for each treatment. Wildlife inhabit very large areas, making the cost of periodic treatments prohibitive. Research is being supported to document the impact of the imported fire ant on wildlife and evaluate management approaches such as the establishment of natural enemies of fire ants from their native habitat. While some wildlife species are undoubtedly declining due to fire ants, there are other factors influencing the decline, such as land use practices and weather extremes. There is hope that the biological control agents released and established in any parts of the state and currently under investigation will permanently reduce imported fire ant populations.\nAre fire ants killing my trees?\nThe ants are mainly using the trees as a nesting place. Ants in mounds occurring at the base of the trunk are probably not causing any damage to well established trees, and may actually be helpful by preying on other insects that are feeding on parts of the tree, and reducing compaction by tunneling in the soil. In Florida, however, imported fire ants do girdle trunks and kill newly planted citrus trees.\nWhy do fire ants get into laundry?\nLaundry piles are convenient places that present lots of tunnels for the ants. They may be attracted to moisture or food residue or oils on soiled clothing. Often, reports of ants in laundry occur following a flood or severe drought. Ants are observed in utility rooms, bathrooms or near the water heater where they have access to the area from outside. When it floods they move into any good dark place, but in drought conditions they tend to move to moist areas.\nCan fire ants be eradicated completely?\nRed imported fire ants cannot be eradicated completely with methods available today in large areas of infestation like in the southeastern United States. But with proper control methods, they can be reduced or eliminated temporarily from small areas. Their biology and spread make it economically, technically and ecologically impossible to eradicate them from larger areas. However, recent efforts have been made to eradicate this ant species from small isolated infestations in California and around Brisbane, Australia. To date, these efforts have not been documented to be a success.\nWhat is the best product for killing fire ants?\nTexas Extension Service Extension does not endorse specific products. However, educational materials produced by Extension specialists provide information that will allow you to make the best choice for your situation. Texas A&M AgriLife Extension can convey research-based information on the performance of products that have been scientifically tested.\nHow do I eliminate fire ants from my yard?\nThere is no single, easy answer for every situation. Most people with more than a handful of mounds (5 ant mounds per \u00bc acre yard or 20 per acre) will be satisfied with just a bait or the \u201cTwo Step Method\u201d, which can provide 80 to 90% reduction of ant mounds in the treated area and works best on larger landscapes such as city blocks, neighborhoods or homeowner associations, school grounds and parks. Other methods may more suitable for smaller lots, where greater control is required or where fewer ants occur and native ant preservation is desired. \u00a0Remember, no method is 100% effective all the time, though some come close, and no method is permanent. The ants will re\u00acinvade, with new colonies probably appearing after the next rain, and certainly within a year.\nWhat is the \u201cTwo- Step Method\u201d for controlling imported fire ants?\nThe Two Step is a proven method of reducing imported fire ant populations in heavily infested home lawns and ornamental turf. Briefly, it is the: 1) once or twice per year broadcast application of a bait product, and 2) treating unwanted active nuisance mounds at any time between these broadcast treatments using an individual mound treatment such as a dust, granule, bait, drench insecticide or home remedy such as use of very-hot water as a drench. By allowing for the bait treatment to take effect this method reduces the over-reliance on use of individual mound treatments and is suitable for treating larger areas. This approach is more cost-effective and environmentally friendly than most other chemical approaches, and \u201corganic\u201d options for the products selected are available.\nWhy tackle fire ants in the fall?\nAn ideal time to apply bait-formulated fire ant insecticides is from late August through October to allow the baits to reduce fire ant populations over the winter. Many bait products are somewhat slow-acting. Bu applying the in late summer or early fall, ant mound numbers will already be suppressed by early spring. Because bait product performance depends on foraging ants to retrieve the bait particles, applying them too early in the spring in cool weather (below 65\u00b0F) will be ineffective. Also, early spring application of slower acting products will not produce maximum effects until later in the spring or early summer. Fall applications are especially good for agricultural sites such as hay pastures where the first cutting is the most valuable.\nIt\u2019s been dry and I don\u2019t see any fire ants. Are they still around? Why should I treat them now?\nThe ants are still there, but the colonies are just not making mounds because of the hard, dry soil caused by heat and drought. They are nesting deeper in the ground during the day and the worker ants come out to forage during cooler parts of the day or at night. Ants are often more of an indoor problem at this time, as they come in seeking food and water. Treating with a bait product now can be very effective since the ants are weakened anyway. Baits can work quite well if the ants pick it up while foraging. In hot, dry periods, it is best to treat in the late afternoon or evening. Using individual mound treatments during hot, dry conditions is not a good idea because mounds are difficult to detect and/or the ants are nesting deeper in the ground.\nWhich bait should I use? How long does it take for baits to work?\nThe key to using baits is patience. Applied properly and using a fresh bait product, a broadcast application will give 80% to 90% control, rarely 100%. For instance, products containing the active ingredient, indoxacarb (Advion\u00ae), are the fastest-acting, providing maximum control within about 2 weeks, while baits containing hydramethylnon (Amdro\u00ae and others) give maximum control in 3 to 6 weeks. Products containing ingredients known as insect growth regulators (IGR\u2019s) such as Extinguish\u00ae (methoprene), Distance\u00ae or Esteem\u00ae (pyriproxyfen) or Award\u00ae (fenoxycarb), when applied late in the year, may take several months to provide maximum control, but will suppress ant colonies for a months. One approach, for example, for heavy imported fire ant infestations is to treat with Amdro\u00ae first for fast knockdown, then come back with Award\u00ae for longer duration control as ants start to reinfest the area some months later. One product, Extinguish Plus is actually a blend of hydramethylnon and methoprene that provides rather quick suppression that lasts longer due to the IGR ingredient. See our Broadcast Bait section for more detailed information.\nWe tried using baits, but they don\u2019t seem to work.\nBaits work well if they are used properly. The thing to remember is the ants collect the bait as a source of food. Putting the bait out at the right time of day, and at the correct rate (usually 1 to 1 1/2 lb/acre but varies by product and formulation) is critical. If the ants are not actively foraging, they will not pick up the bait. The best times to apply bait applications occur between 65 and 95\u00b0F \u2013 generally mid-morning after the dew has evaporated, or late afternoon on hot days when the air begins to cool. Apply a small amount of bait or other food lure such as a potato chip in the area to be treated. If ants are all over it within 45 to 60 minutes, the bait is fresh and the ants are foraging! Always read and follow closely the directions provided on the product label before using any pesticide.\nWhen and how often should I reapply the bait?\nThe fall application is important because it will help suppress ants by the following spring. Reapply when imported fire ant mounds begin to appear again. Generally, if you make a spring application, suppression should last until that fall, when the next application should be made. Re-infestation depends on size of area treated and frequencies of mating flights. Larger areas experience less colony immigration from untreated adjacent properties. During favorable colony development conditions and wet years, mating flights may be more frequent and intense, resulting in more newly formed colonies that appear one to two months following a successful mating flight.\nI can\u2019t afford to treat for fire ants.\nIf you have a 1/4 acre lot (100 x 100 feet, 70 X 150, etc.) you would need less than 1/2 pound of a bait product. A pound costs around $10 and yields two applications, with some to spare. Within a month or so, it would likely get ants down to a level you wouldn\u2019t notice. For faster control, treat individual nuisance mounds after broadcasting a bait product. See our Broadcast Bait section for cost comparisons among products. It\u2019s really not that expensive, if done right.\nWhich is best product to use?\nThere are over a hundred products labeled for use on fire ants and other ant species, but these products contain only a dozen or so common active ingredients. See our Broadcast Bait section for product names and information. In general, most products are effective and pose minimal risk when applied as directed. The trick is to compare characteristics of the active ingredients, concentrations and price (or the cost per ant mound treated). Buy the most appropriate product for your situation and use it strictly according label directions.\nBack to the Top of the Page\nWhat are some options for controlling fire ants inside the home?\nThe most important step is to identify the ant species and locating the nesting site. For ants nesting indoors, some products labeled for indoor use can be applied, including bait formulations, which foraging worker ants collect and take back to the colony to feed the queen. Trails of foraging ants can be sprayed with a contact insecticide, but these treatments do not directly affect the colony and may cause colonies to divide into a number of smaller colonies. Read and follow the directions on the product label for best results. Be sure to keep products away from small children and pets. Treating ants in the landscape outside will also help control some ant species, particularly imported fire ants that foraging inside from outdoor colonies or occasionally migrate indoors to nest. Finally, a band of contact insecticide can also be applied around the perimeter of your house to provide a barrier against invasion.\nWhat is the safest product for my children, pets, chickens, etc.?\nAlways follow the directions provided on the product\u2019s label. For insecticides registered by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), labeled products pose minimum risk to people and the environment when applied as directed. \u00a0You can use a less toxic material and apply it so that there will be little contact. The main concern is to not put a contact insecticide in high concentrations where children and animals can contact it, including storing insecticides where they are inaccessible. \u00a0Bait products, when broadcast applied, not only have very low toxicity, but are scattered very thinly and fall down in the grass where few things other than ants can encounter them. Granular and dust products will remain on the soil surface where potential contact can occur unless the material is watered in after application. Drenches may be a better individual mound treatment choice. Keep animals and kids away from treated areas as directed or until vegetation and the soil surface are dry.\nWhat are some considerations when using insecticides around water and well heads?\nMuch of the same information holds true as for ant management around children and animals, but there is also the danger of ant mound drenches containing contact insecticides running off either immediately or after a rain. Selecting products with ingredients known to be less toxic to aquatic organisms can help. Some product labels, such as products containing fipronil, specify how far from the edge of a body of water a chemical can be applied. When broadcast-applying a bait product, make sure not to get bait particles in surface water as they may be eaten by fish. Contact the manufacturer for answers to questions about their products.\nIs there anything I can use that isn\u2019t a pesticide?\nA pesticide is anything that kills pests. However, some options do not rely on chemicals formulated to kill insects. Using very hot water is somewhat effective for individual mounds. Approximately 3 gallons of very hot water poured onto mounds will eliminate ants about 60% of the time. Drench mounds on cool sunny mornings when the ants are close to the surface. However, you will risk damaging plants, grass, and even burning yourself. Some home remedies such as instant grits thought be eaten by ants and swell in their stomachs and cause death when placed on the mound, have demonstrated to be ineffective, in this case because worker ants cannot ingest particles larger than 2 microns.\n\nAre there organic methods to control fire ants?\nFire ant control methods considered to be \u201corganic\u201d usually include cultural, physical, mechanical and biological control techniques, but some chemical treatments such as plant-derived (botanical, such as pyrethrins or d-limonene) and microbial-produced (such as spinosad) \u00a0insecticides are considered to be \u201cof natural origin,\u201d or organic. Some products are certified as organic by OMRI (Organic Materials Research Institute). Regardless of chemical origin or preparation, the Texas Fire Ant Project promotes the use of the least toxic methods. OMRI certified organic products such as bait and mound treatments using products containing spinosad or mound drenches using products containing pyrethrins or d-limonene can be used with the Two Step method.\nAre there any biological controls for fire ants? I heard about a fly that is supposed to kill fire ants, what\u2019s the story on that?\nThe University of Texas and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) have been conducting research on fire ant parasitic phorid fly species as one of several potential biological control agents for helping to control fire ants. Three species have been released and established in parts of Texas and are spreading naturally to adjacent areas. However, documentation about their impact on fire ant population levels has been published to date. Even in South America where the imported fire ants and parasitic fly species come from, the flies only affect about 3% of the worker ants in a colony. Some biological control agents that have already been marketed include predaceous mites, parasitic nematodes, and the fungus called Beauveria bassiana. Scientific studies continue to be being conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of some of these natural enemies, but others remain untested or have not been shown to be highly effective.\nWhy can\u2019t I just pour gasoline on the mounds?\nDon\u2019t do it! It probably does not kill the entire colony much of the time, it is dangerous to handle, it kills any plant material it touches, and at least some of the residue remains in the soil and may leach or run off into ground and/or surface water.\nWhy don\u2019t we use Mirex?\nMirex was an effective ant killer, but it was one of the most persistent compounds ever made. Mirex belongs to a group of chemicals that have mostly been banned from sale or use. Their ingredients, or their degradation products, accumulated in biological systems.\nCan I purchase and spread fire ant bait on my yard without a \u201cPrivate Applicators License\u201d?\nOn your own property or on other private property as an unpaid volunteer, non-licensed private individuals can apply bait products. None of the baits are restricted products, but several may only be obtained from distributors to professional pest control operators or landscapers. See our Broadcast Bait section for over-the-counter baits at consumer retailers.\nI assume a license would be required to spread fire ant bait and insecticides as a commercial business and on public rights-of-way.\nIf you are paid for your service in urban or agricultural and rural areas, you will need a license from the Texas Department of Agriculture (TDA), which provides commercial or non-commercial licenses. \u00a0On public school grounds, permission and supervision must be obtained from the designated IPM coordinator for that school. For rights-of-way, permission to treat must be obtained from the agency managing the property (e.g. Texas Dept. of Transportation).\nBack to the Top of the Page\nDoes the worker who is spreading the bait have to be licensed or can he/she work under a licensed supervisor?\nIf fees are rendered for the service, workers must work under the supervision of a licensed pest control operator.\nIs the State of Texas or Texas A&M AgriLife Extension offering pesticides for fire ants at a reduced cost for homeowners?\nNone of the funding provided by the Texas legislature to implement the Texas Imported Fire Ant Research & Management Project can be used to buy or apply insecticides. The objectives of the educational program being conducted by Texas A&M AgriLife Extension include encouraging homeowners and/or community groups to 1) decide what methods of control are right for their situation, and 2) use these methods for sustainable or long-\u00acterm suppression by doing it yourself or with your neighbors, or with the help of a professional pest control service.\nI think all pesticides are dangerous and harm the environment. Why should I be paying tax money to encourage people use them?\nPesticides vary greatly in toxicity to the target organism, the user, and the environment. An even greater danger occurs when people misuse or overuse pesticides. One of the goals of the Fire Ant Project is to educate people on the selection and proper use of the least toxic methods to control imported fire ants. In this way, we hope to decrease overall pesticide use and make it safer for people and the environment at the same time. There is also a lot of effort and funding support for ongoing research to develop nonchemical methods for fire ant suppression.\n\nAll that tax money for fire ant research is a waste. How come I don\u2019t ever see any results?\nResearch is a slow, methodical process. Even if an exciting discovery is made in the laboratory, it must be tested in the field. Then its practical use must be proven. The process may be slow, but the investment in research is the only option that can potentially provide major advancements in improving today\u2019s methods of imported fire ant control.\n\nWhy don\u2019t we have a program like the one that solved the screwworm problem?\nRed imported fire ant biology is different from screwworm biology. With funding from the Texas Fire Ant Project, researchers are beginning to investigate potential behavioral, genetic and reproductive factors that could be exploited as possible components in controlling fire ants. Even if the same sterile male technique as used in the screwworm problem were possible to use with red imported fire ants, the technology to raise, sterilize and make timely releases of high numbers of sterile male ants has not been developed.\nWhy should I care about fire ants if I live in an area that doesn\u2019t have them?\nYou should care about fire ants because you could have them soon! The Texas Fire Ant Project is funding extensive surveys to detect and document the occurrence and spread of the red imported fire ant (and native ant species that compete with it for food and resources). Where detected, appropriate actions can be taken to slow or even stop their spread.\nBack to the Top of the Page\nComments are closed.\nSolutions for a Changing World\nAgriLife Extension&apos;s online Bookstore offers educational information and resources related to our many areas of expertise and programming; from agriculture, horticulture, and natural resources to nutrition, wellness for families and youth, and much more."], ["There's a Reason They Call Them 'Crazy Ants'", "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/08/magazine/crazy-ants.html?pagewanted=all", ""], ["Ants Go Marching", "http://nautil.us/issue/3/in-transit/ants-go-marching", " Nautilus publishes a new chapter of feature stories on its monthly theme, every Thursday.Sign up to this list to stay up to date on the latest and greatest.\nRead about the Nautilus stories and blogs we've been thinking about over the past week.\nBreaking news and quirky facts from the web, seen from the Nautilus perspective and linked to our own stories.\nEnter Search Below\u2026\nResume Reading \u2014 Ants Go Marching\nFive World War II bombers took off from a Florida airfield on Oct. 5, 1967 to bomb the American South. An article that ran that morning in the Sarasota\u00a0Herald-Tribune said that three B-17s and two PV-2s laden with 10,000 pounds of death-dealing cargo each would carry out their missions \u201cwith the City of Sarasota and eastern Manatee as their targets.\u201d\nWhile the bombers were certainly at war, they weren\u2019t dropping explosives. Their enemy was a millimeters-long, brownish-red insect known to scientists as Solenopsis invicta, meaning \u201cinvincible ant,\u201d and to lay people as the fire ant, aka \u201cants from hell\u201d and \u201cthem devils.\u201d The bombers were to unload mirex, a poison usually applied to grits, onto the critter.\nBy the late 1960s, the fire ant had been in the American South for more than 30 years. Southerners spoke of ruined crops, destroyed wildlife, and the ants\u2019 fiery sting. How much damage the ants had actually caused was uncertain, but it was enough for the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to declare war on the pest. During an 11-year campaign, more than 143 million pounds of mirex1 were dropped across 77,220 square miles of land from Texas to Florida, costing close to $200 million. The outcome? The ants nearly doubled their range. The mirex, which was later found to be a carcinogen, persisted in the environment for decades, accumulating in birds\u2019 eggs, mammals\u2019 milk, and human tissues. The world\u2019s leading ant researcher, E.O. Wilson, dubbed the mirex program the \u201cVietnam of entomology.\u201d\nToday, if you draw a line from Virginia Beach to Nashville to Abilene in west Texas, you\u2019ll find fire ants everywhere below it, as well as in Southern California.2 The ants\u2019 annual impact on the economy, environment, and quality of life in the United States totals $6 billion, according to entomologists at Texas A&M University. In Texas alone they rack up $1.2 billion each year: $47 million at golf courses; $64 million at cemeteries (the ants love the open and slightly overgrown habitat around tombs); and as much as $255 million in the cattle industry. They cause other problems too. In Virginia Beach, 30-year-old former marine Bradley Johnson was stung by fire ants while working outside\u2014and died of anaphylactic shock. On at least one occasion, fire ants invaded an elementary school in Tennessee to get candy stashed in kids\u2019 lockers. At Greystone Retirement Community in Huntsville, Ala., a staffer found 79-year-old Lucille Devers3 covered in fire ants, which were crawling from her mouth, nose, ears, and hair: The ants frequently enter nursing homes, attracted by crumbs left in residents\u2019 beds. And scientists anticipate that the ants will keep expanding their range. Climate change and crossbreeding with species more tolerant of cold may enable them to settle farther north.\nI, on the contrary, moved south. Last August, my girlfriend, Karen, and I sold most of our belongings, piled two cats, a terrier, and a pudgy brown Chihuahua named Jazzy-B, into a minivan and drove from New York City to New Orleans. A few weeks later, we toasted our arrival with a picnic in City Park. As we rolled up our blanket, our legs suddenly caught fire. Under the glow of a streetlight, we slipped off our pants to find our legs crawling with ants. I received more than 200 stings, which formed welts the size of drink coasters, and my ears and throat swelled up. Half a dozen Benadryls later I was fine, except for hundreds of very itchy pustules. Luckily I wasn\u2019t anaphylactic, but between 0.5 and 5 percent of the U.S. population is.4 For the most allergic, such stings can cause spasms of the bronchial muscles or coronary arteries, preventing oxygen from entering the bloodstream and causing death within minutes. When a few weeks later Jazzy-B stepped on an ant mound and howled, spending the rest of the day licking his paw, I was ready to declare my own war on the fire ant. But first I had to research my enemy.\nThe range of Solenopsis invicta covers a vast wetland in southern Brazil and Paraguay known as the Pantanal. Sometime in the early 1930s the ants stowed away in coffee sacks, soil, or hollow logs piled in the bottom of a cargo ship. The voyagers were probably just a handful of queens, each about the width of a thumbnail. They ate what they could find down in the hold\u2014cockroaches, beetles, sugary cargo, and, when the pickings got slim, themselves, digesting their own wing muscles and fat reserves. Their ship may well have steamed past Rio de Janeiro, the mouth of the Amazon, and the lush peaks of the Antilles, all while their first batch of eggs gestated in their abdomens. In Mobile, Ala., the ship docked, the sacks or soil or logs were unloaded, and the queens disembarked. Beneath the port\u2019s loading cranes and circling seagulls, perhaps in a patch of newly cut grass, the ants established their first colony: a mound of soil honeycombed with chambers and tunnels that ran as much as four feet deep. They like to build mounds in disturbed habitats such as the edge of a road, the side of a building, pastures, lawns, or near a busy port.5 They eat pretty much anything\u2014seeds, nectar, worms, weevils, butterflies, and even baby sea turtles, snakes, and alligators\u2014catching the young as they hatch.\nColonies consist of queens, workers, and sexuals, also called alates. Queens lay eggs that hatch into larvae\u2014tiny, white, ricelike kernels that develop into adult ants. Alates are born at the end of winter or the beginning of spring, and spend their lives fattening up and preparing for their mating flight. Workers begin life as nurses, grooming and feeding the brood and the queen. They move on to tasks like nest maintenance and sanitation. In their golden years, workers become foragers, handling the colony\u2019s most dangerous job, as it exposes them to predators and the elements. As the life in them winds down, workers act as their own pallbearers, lying down to die in a mass ant grave called the refuse pile.\nTo trace the ants\u2019 seemingly unstoppable march through the South, I decided to follow their path from where they first staked their claim to American soil. Just before I left, as if an ominous sign from some myrmecological god, a mound swelled up in our backyard. I headed out on my odyssey nonetheless, undaunted.\nAs the life in them winds down, workers act as their own pallbearers, lying down to die in a mass ant grave.\nMobile, the twelfth largest port in the nation, which last year handled 26 million tons of cargo, greeted me with loading cranes that looked like characters from some gigantic industrial alphabet, a stench of diesel fuel, sea spray that hung in the air, and\u2014sure enough\u2014fire ant mounds. Near the port, cattails poked out the top of one. Its surface was lifeless, but when I kicked it lightly, seeking revenge for my itchy pustules, the creatures swarmed out. They might have been the great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandchildren (queens live about seven years) of the group that had steamed here from South America back in the 1930s.\nA short walk from the port was a neighborhood of arching oaks and trim ranch homes with well-clipped lawns. I stopped at 550 Charleston Street, the childhood home of E.O. Wilson\u2014to ponder the fact that the planet\u2019s most famous ant biologist grew up at the epicenter of the planet\u2019s most famous ant invasion. In the weedy vacant lot next door, a young Wilson studied beetles, butterflies, spiders, and all manner of ants, including Solenopsis invicta, whose mound he first discovered in May 1942, at age 12. \u201cI still remember the species I found, in vivid detail,\u201d Wilson wrote in Naturalist, a book about his insect-happy childhood. Now the neighborhood appeared to be fire ant-less\u2014thanks to the tireless, creative, and brutal efforts of its human inhabitants.\nSitting next to a table that held a rifle and a dead squirrel, Lonnie Rayford, a 72-year-old farmer, told me he \u201cdone got bit\u201d many a time. In his opinion, one science does not really confirm, just plain grits were good enough to kill the pests. \u201cDig a hole and put grits in there, they gonna take it down to the bottom and give it to the queen,\u201d he said. \u201cThem grits will kill them.\u201d Down the street, a husky man pulling weeds from his garden told me he used poison.\nFrom Mobile, I headed northeast to Montgomery, where I drove by the state capitol, a creamy white dome calling to mind a magnificent wedding cake. I stopped at Dixie Hardware to learn about fire ant control from the pros. A bearded worker named John showed me to aisle nine, which was an exterminator\u2019s nirvana.\n\u201cYou got roach and ant killer, you got ant killer, you got Ant Max\u2014it\u2019s some kind of trap,\u201d he said, holding up a rectangular red-and-yellow box that looked like it could have contained movie theater candies, except for a drawing of a vicious fire ant on the side. The best seller was a big orange bag that read \u201cSpectracide Fire Ant Killer Mound Destroyer.\u201d\nJohn\u2019s coworker Richard explained to me the challenges and intricacies of mass insecticide. The problem with poison was that ants often simply moved into the neighbor\u2019s yard, requiring neighborhood-wide poisoning efforts\u2014in other words, it took a village to rid itself of the pests. Another trick involved two people shoveling ants from separate mounds into one another\u2014according to Richard, the ants will assassinate the foreign queens. And then there is gasoline, apparently Alabama\u2019s preferred eradication method. \u201cTake a broom handle, stick it down the mound, pour gas on it, and I know it\u2019s gonna burn whatever is in there,\u201d Richard said excitedly.\nEliminating fire ants seemed a bit like making cornbread; every Southerner had his own favorite recipe. By this time, my welts were long gone and I began to feel bad for the little ants. Especially since I understood that their inexorable spread was, in large part, our own fault.\nNaturally, ants don\u2019t really spread that fast: During the 1930s and 1940s fire ants migrated out from Mobile at the rate of about 4 to 5 miles a year, a distance thought to be covered mostly in mating flights. On warm days following soaking spring or summer rains, alates exit the mound surrounded by a gang of worker bodyguards and launch into the air to mate\u2014which they do in large clouds called mating swarms. Males inject females with a lifetime supply of sperm and then die. Newly mated queens land, kick off their wings, and scurry away to start new colonies, avoiding predators like dragonflies, which love to gobble their sperm-filled abdomens. Queens typically fly a few miles during mating flights, and if the wind is right, they can fly more than ten. But that\u2019s it.\nAnts can also move when disturbed. In such a case an entire colony moves, but typically only a few feet, a migration initiated automatically by the workers. And a good many fire ant colonies across the South\u2014known as polygyne colonies, meaning those with more than one queen\u2014can actually move without mating flights, by budding off like yeast. A queen and some workers will simply wander off to start a new colony, but, again, they won\u2019t go far. The most successful means for fire ant migration, however, is us. Humans.\nEliminating fire ants seemed a bit like making cornbread; every Southerner had his own favorite recipe.\nIn 1949 fire ants were mostly situated in a roughly 50-mile-wide radius around Mobile and in a few spots in central Alabama and Mississippi. But as Americans moved to the suburbs during the 1950s, desirous of white picket fences, front lawns, and ornamental shrubs, the nursery trade boomed. Soil, plants, and pots were shipped across states and counties. Hidden in the dirt caked on a bulldozer, in the root ball of a nursery plant, or in the bed of a pickup truck, a newly mated queen can travel hundreds of miles. Thanks to our horticultural aspirations, by 1957 S. invicta were in every Southern state except Kentucky and the Virginias.\nIt was around then that the U.S. Department of Agriculture set out to eliminate the invaders.6 In 1958 it established a quarantine that restricted the shipment of soil, nursery plants, and baled hay from areas infested with fire ants to those without, unless the products were first treated with insecticides. Between 1957 and 1962 the USDA coated 2.5 million acres with clay granules containing the insecticide heptachlor. It did indeed kill fire ants, but also blackbirds, quail, geese, frogs, dogs, cats, crabs, and millions of fish\u2014a famous fiasco that helped inspire Rachel Carson\u2019s Silent Spring. Few at the USDA seemed to heed her warning, so the war continued. That entomological Vietnam, which lasted from 1964 to 1975, according to The Fire Ants, a book by myrmecologist Walter Tschinkel, left 24 to 33 percent of Southerners with mirex in their body tissues.\nMeanwhile, the invincible creatures nearly doubled their range, and some scientists speculated the insecticide was the cause. The poison often eliminated all the ant species where it was applied, giving S. invicta, which is thought to be a better colony founder, a chance to become the dominant type upon recolonization. The secrets of their survival are not entirely known, but Tschinkel thinks it has something to do with large colonies, large numbers of alates, large dispersal distances, and a long mating flight season.\nThe fire ant front line runs through the middle of Tennessee. I continued north on the ants\u2019 path and pulled off the highway in McMinnville, the heart of the state\u2019s nursery industry and just inside the line. Here, nursery growers have to douse plants\u2019 roots, where newly mated queens sometimes cling undetected, with Chlorpyrifos, a toxic and expensive insecticide. Tommy Boyd, co-owner of Boyd & Boyd Nursery, told me his workers did the task while wearing gloves and respirators. He refused to touch the stuff himself because the insecticide gave him horrible headaches. \u201cI don\u2019t want to die over some chemical,\u201d Boyd told me.\nI drove down a windy lane a short time later that brought me to Tennessee State University\u2019s Otis L. Floyd Nursery Research Center. Here I spoke with a gentle entomologist in a flannel shirt named Jason Oliver, who works on a less destructive and more natural ant eradication method: A project to introduce phorid flies, who prey on the ants back in Pantanal. In the late 1990s USDA researchers went to South America to capture different species of phorid flies, which they studied at an Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) lab in Gainesville, Fla., to determine the best one to introduce to various parts of the American South. Oliver\u2019s phorid flies are shipped from the lab to be released in Tennessee.\nPhorids lay their eggs in the fire ants\u2019 thorax, and when the eggs hatch, the ants\u2019 heads fall off.7 Oliver showed me a video he had filmed in a petri dish, a fly implanting eggs in an ant. A tiny dot buzzed about some ants; in the blink of an eye it brushed one of them, then continued flying. In that moment the fly had injected the eggs. It happened so quickly I asked Oliver to replay the video. It seemed like a perfect solution. But as impressive as the tiny fly was, it wasn\u2019t going to decapitate a whole colony, just make ants more scared to leave their nests. \u201cWe\u2019re always going to have fire ants,\u201d Oliver told me. \u201cThere is no way to eliminate them.\u201d\nWeaving through rolling hills dotted with nurseries, I drove northwest from McMinnville, skirting the S. invicta front line: To the south, elementary schools, nursing homes, and greenhouses were being invaded, while to the north, the land was, supposedly, fire ant-free. The road took me through the area inundated in the catastrophic floods of May 2010. In Nashville, the Cumberland River rose 33 feet, flooding much of the city, including the Country Music Hall of Fame, the Grand Ole Opry House, and an untold number of fire ant mounds. Contrary to expectations, the ants didn\u2019t drown. Instead, they metastasized further.\nThe ants would have been well prepared, Louisiana State University entomologist Linda Hooper-Bui explained to me. In their homeland the Pantanal floods happen annually, so they learned to raft. As waters rise, ants evacuate lower tunnels and move higher in their mound, eventually gathering on top. Using hooks, called tarsi, on the tips of their legs, ants latch onto one another and create rafts. Late-stage larvae are covered in hook-like hairs that trap air, encasing them in bubbles. Worker ants stack these larvae three to five thick, forming pontoons that keep the rafts afloat. They place the queen in the middle with pupae and early-stage larvae, which don\u2019t have the crucial hairs to form the bubbles. Save the clumps of eggs workers carry in their jaws and a small amount of liquid food stored in their bodies that will last only a few days, the ants bring nothing aboard. Moreover, as the raft sets off, tipped into the water by the workers, they fling male alates overboard. If the raft is afloat longer than four days, the ants will begin to eat the brood\u2014although not the ones used to make the raft. Rafts can hold together for as long as 21 days, surely long enough to survive the swollen Cumberland River.\nOr at least this is what Steve Powell, an entomologist with the state of Tennessee, believes. In February of this year he received a call reporting fire ants in Cumberland City, a remote town about 80 miles north from Nashville and far above the front line. \u201cThere\u2019s no rhyme or reason why they should be there, so far from other fire ant infestations,\u201d Powell said. \u201cIf I had to guess, I\u2019d say it was the flood.\u201d\nPhorids lay their eggs in the fire ants\u2019 thorax, and when the eggs hatch, the ants\u2019 heads fall off.\nContinuing my journey, I drove farther north into Cumberland City\u2014a ramshackle collection of vine-ensnarled clapboard homes and shuttered storefronts on steep forested hills above the Cumberland River. On the edge of town sat a massive Tennessee Valley Authority coal plant with four 1,000-foot-tall smokestacks, some of the largest on earth. Beside the plant was a small restaurant with foggy windows, where farmers in overalls sat at low tables gobbling catfish and pork chops. I was looking for someone to speak with about the ants, expecting a thrilling validation of Powell\u2019s rafting theory. Instead I found an unsurprising surprise: Bailey Gafford, a weatherworn cattle farmer in mud-splattered boots, told me fire ants had been in Cumberland City since before the floods. He even suggested an innovative method of eradication I hadn\u2019t heard before: \u201cPut snuff around the mound. They come out and you set \u2019em on fire.\u201d\nOn my way out of Cumberland City I stopped at a Civil War cemetery, where wildflowers cloaked weather-beaten tombs and atop a small hill stood a dozen crude cabins, campground for a long-forgotten battle. Our own battle against the ant was still in full swing, however, and it didn\u2019t look like we were winning. The war on S. invicta suddenly fit into a broader picture, that of the Insecticide-Military-Industrial Complex. It was around the time that President Obama announced, concerning the nation\u2019s ongoing war on terrorism, that we cannot remain on \u201ca perpetual wartime footing.\u201d The statement also seemed to apply to our war against the fire ants.\nBesides, no matter how we perfect our tactics, these ultimate invaders seem to find new ways to advance. Somehow, Solenopsis invicta crossbred with Solenopsis richteri, another species that came from Pantanal by cargo ship8 to Mobile, in 1918. Originally S. invicta drove out S. richteri, a less aggressive variety that prefers cooler weather and might have found the South too hot. But in the 1980s a hybrid of the two was discovered. No one knows exactly how the hybridization occurred\u2014in certain parts of the Pantanal the two species\u2019 territories overlap, but they don\u2019t interbreed. Here they do, which is perhaps the most ominous sign. Purebred S. invicta don\u2019t survive more than three or four days in temperatures below freezing. Neither does S. richteri. But the hybrid survives freezing temperatures better than either pure species, according to a 2002 study in Environmental Entomology.\nCould a hybrid\u2014or perhaps a hybrid of a hybrid\u2014one day push that front line farther north, to Washington D.C., and Philadelphia? What about New York City, with its 8 million residents as clueless as I once was? Recently the ants were brought by ship from the U.S. to Australia and also Taiwan; from there they invaded China. According to a 2004 paper in Biological Invasions, fire ants could potentially infest France, Italy, Greece, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Central America, and large parts of Africa and India. Is there a way for us to coexist with the creatures? I was still hopeful.\nUpon returning to New Orleans I discovered the fire ant mound in our backyard had quadrupled in size. It now towered above the grass blades like Kilimanjaro. As I stood dumbfounded, contemplating what to do, a potato bug ascended the northern flank, an agile alpinist indeed, somehow not inducing a swarm. I wanted to be like the potato bug and coexist with the mound, dance my fingers upon its slopes without getting stung, but I knew it was impossible. Even if Karen and I somehow avoided the nest, there were our animals to think of\u2014the cats, the terrier, and Jazzy-B, who at that moment was watching me from inside with curious dog eyes. Last time he got off easy, but if he received hundreds of stings, the poison would surely overwhelm his little Chihuahua system. The choice was clear. I would have to eradicate the mound.\nThe abundance of killing choices was what puzzled me: Pit rival colonies against each other, grits, gasoline, a broom and gasoline, poison and, if poison, which one? In the end I decided on a less ecologically invasive technique no one had mentioned except for Oliver\u2014he muttered it under his breath toward the end of our conversation as if revealing a secret that embarrassed him: hot water. Ant Max and Spectracide Fire Ant Killer Mound Destroyer don\u2019t seem to want you to know about it.\nI wanted to be like the potato bug and coexist with the mound, dance my fingers upon its slopes without getting stung.\nWith Jazzy-B and all the others safely inside, I emptied the cat litter box, dusted it with baby powder so the ants couldn\u2019t crawl up the sides, and shoveled the mound into it, quickly adding boiling water to fill it. A second pot of boiling water went into the open mound, to seep down into the interior tunnels and chambers, and then a third and a fourth, too, just to be sure I got the queen. There was an initial explosion of red, with numerous of the brood being moved about, but the water cooked them instantly and, within the hour, the mound was dead.\nI gathered my household armor and walked back toward the house, with far from a satisfying sense of achievement. I might have won this battle, but we were still losing the war. Inevitably, another mound would pop up. My \u201cvictory\u201d was just a reprieve.\n\nJustin Nobel\u2019s stories about science and culture have appeared in Popular Mechanics, Orion, and Tin House.

It is one of the original \"dirty dozen\" chemicals targeted for elimination by the international treaty signed at the Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants in 2001.\nThere are five times more fire ants per acre in the United States than in their native South America. Fire ants cover 321 million acres in the U.S., across 13 states and Puerto Rico, which adds up to 501,563 square miles. That\u2019s more than Germany, France, and the U.K. combined, or almost one-eighth of Europe.\nLucille Devers, who was found swarmed by fire ants at the nursing home where she lived, was awarded $5.35 million by an Alabama jury. The $5.35 million award, returned on June 28, 2002, included $3.5 million in punitive damages, with Greystone and Terminix paying $1.75 million each.\n40 million people live in fire ant\u2013infested areas, 30 to 60 percent of whom are stung annually by the ants, according to the USDA report, \u201cIntegrated Management of Imported Fire Ants and Emerging Urban Pest Problems.\u201d It is estimated that 1 percent, 400,000 people, have an anaphylactic reaction.\nThe ants are also drawn to electrical boxes; when one gets fried a signal is released that brings others. The ants have been known to short out traffic lights and airport radar systems.\nUse of insecticide spray averages 4 fluid ounces per 1,000 square feet, which comes to 174,240 fluid ounces\u2014or 1,361.25 gallons\u2014of spray per acre. This equals 436,961,250,000 gallons for the entire affected region, or nearly 662,000 Olympic-size swimming pools full of insecticide spray each year in the U.S.\nSeveral days after the phorid fly lays eggs in the thorax of a worker ant, the maggot releases a chemical that causes the ant to crumple over; it also loosens its head and front legs. The maggot then eats the contents of the ant\u2019s head and the head falls off. Other ants carry the body to the colony\u2019s refuse pile, including the head occupied by the maggot, which it uses as its pupal case. It emerges 45 days later as an adult fly.\nMore than 54,000 cargo ships are hustling goods around the world, and checking all of them for fire ants has proved impossible.\nNautilus is a different kind of science magazine.

He\u2019s crouched in the bottom of an eight-foot-deep hole in the ground, in a hot, dry, open field between the Tallahassee, Florida, airport and a sewage-treatment plant. Clay-infused sand comes flying out of the hole as he shovels. Tschinkel, 62, rests a moment, then picks up a trowel and pokes sand away from one wall of the pit. He glances up. \u201cI think we can start taking it out,\u201d he says.\nAs he prods with the trowel tip, a fantastic sculpture begins to emerge from the earth. He scrapes away more sand, revealing tubes and elliptical lobes that a moment ago were completely buried. The thing is so delicate that, as Tschinkel and his graduate students remove it from the ground, it breaks into dozens of pieces. An ant nest, perfectly cast in three dimensions, it will be reassembled later in the laboratory. Tschinkel has spent this fine April morning mixing dental plaster to the consistency of eggnog, adding glass fibers, propping a cupped leaf against the nest\u2019s entrance as a funnel, pouring the plaster, and letting it set. That\u2019s when he dug the pit beside the nest and liberated the cast.\nJH PeteCarmichaelPogonomyrmex badiusRange: coastal plains of the southeastern United States, from Georgia to LouisianaAverage nest depth: 7 feetAverage number of chambers: 100Average colony size: 5,000A mature nest of the pogo, or Florida harvester ant, can reach 10 feet and contain 200 chambers.

For more than a decade, Tschinkel, a myrmecologist, or ant specialist, at Florida State University in Tallahassee, has studied the behavior and social organization of ants. His curiosity was aroused by their nests\u2014mysterious underground caverns never clearly seen by scientists. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to visualize what\u2019s underground,\u201d he says. What did the nests look like, really? What could they reveal about ants and how they structured their lives? A few sketches had appeared in scientific journals but rarely to scale and with little detail. Tschinkel tried excavating nests and making his own sketches but found he couldn\u2019t see their three-dimensional structure clearly. Then, 15 years ago, he got an idea. He mixed plaster and poured it into a fire-ant nest. When he dug up the casting and painstakingly glued the pieces back together, \u201cit was a revelation.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nNow, he says, we can describe ant-nest architecture much more precisely, leading to a better understanding of the insects and the mysterious principle known to science as self-organization\u2014simple units of nature forming larger patterns through interactions with one another. An ant colony develops when each individual does its job in response to outside cues. The rules for this behavior, Tschinkel says, are \u201csomehow internally programmed; they result from the way the nervous system is organized.\u201d Each of thousands of earth-nesting ant species has a specific nest design, and each builds from a particular set of rules. \u201cWhat is that set of rules? How do they come by them? How do they execute them?\u201d Tschinkel wonders. \u201cHow does a group of individuals with no leader, no plan, create such complex structures in the dark?\u201dMyrmecologist Walter Tschinkel of the University of Florida holds up a partial zinc cast of a seven-foot-deep Florida harvester-ant nest. The flat chambers are living quarters as well as storerooms for seeds, which the foraging harvesters collect, shuck, and deliver to the workers underground for stocking and sorting.\nNow, he says, we can describe ant-nest architecture much more precisely, leading to a better understanding of the insects and the mysterious principle known to science as self-organization\u2014simple units of nature forming larger patterns through interactions with one another.

The flat chambers are living quarters as well as storerooms for seeds, which the foraging harvesters collect, shuck, and deliver to the workers underground for stocking and sorting.\nMost ant colonies begin when one newly mated queen digs a single-chambered nest, seals herself in, and rears a first brood of workers. Queen ants need be fertilized only once: They store a lifetime supply of sperm in a sac, and in mature colonies, if the ambient temperature is warm enough\u201472 degrees Fahrenheit\u2014some queens can lay 1,000 eggs a day for many years. The brood hatches in a week and, feeding on reserves in the queen\u2019s body, grows to maturity in a month. Then the workers begin foraging\u2014in the case of Florida harvester ants, for insects and seeds\u2014to feed the next brood of eggs. And so the colony expands. Workers live about a year, but a colony can survive 10 or 20 years, until the queen dies. The colonies of most ant species, including the harvester, are social, cooperative, seamless organisms, differing from what we think of as an individual organism only in that \u201cthey\u2019re not stuck together,\u201d as Tschinkel puts it. The colony is a kind of creature\u2014a superorganism.\nTschinkel made his first cast in 1985\u2014a nest of fire ants, known as Solenopsis invicta, meaning \u201cthe unvanquished.\u201d They create huge, long-lived colonies with a quarter of a million individuals, and queens that live for seven years. While most ants defend only their nests, fire ants ferociously defend surrounding territory, too, often over 1,000 square feet, and their stings are memorable even to mammals. Tschinkel had completed groundbreaking studies revealing \u201cthe behavioral rules governing the flow of food\u201d in their colonies. He had explored their nests\u2014first chloroforming the inhabitants, partly for his own safety but mostly \u201cto knock them down where they stood so I could see how they were distributed in the nest\u201d\u2014and thought he had a good idea of the nests\u2019 geometry. But when he poured dental plaster into one and then dug it out, the picture was much clearer. \u201cThe nests of fire ants are a lot more patterned and less randomly arranged than I had thought,\u201d he says. \u201cThey were obviously organized, regular, predictable\u2014so interesting. I got into the architecture.\u201d\n\u00a0 Graphic by Don FoleyBuilding From the Ground DownFloor plans for ant nests vary by species, but Tschinkel\u2019s research has revealed that many colonies follow a common sequence in carving out their underground homes. A colony starts when a newly mated queen digs a tunnel and rears her first few dozen larvae from nutrients stored in her body. Within a month, the adult workers sort themselves by age, with the oldest workers taking on tasks specific to the upper nest and the younger ones doing the deeper work. As chambers and corridors are added, the queen retreats into the nether nest and begins laying as many as 1,000 eggs to keep up with the construction crews. In three to five years, the colony completes the final version of the nest, and the queen slows down, effectively ending the baby boom and shifting the makeup of the mature colony from 50 percent youngsters to 25 percent. \u2014Jocelyn Selim\n\n\u00a0 Graphic by Don Foley\nBuilding From the Ground DownFloor plans for ant nests vary by species, but Tschinkel\u2019s research has revealed that many colonies follow a common sequence in carving out their underground homes.

The trap-jaw\u2019s gigantic mandibles protrude to the sides, giving it the look of a hammerhead shark. The jaws are remarkably strong: If the ant clamps something too smooth and round to hold on to and its jaws slip off, they snap shut with enough force to shoot the ant three inches backward. In this cast, Tschinkel recognized the same construction he\u2019d seen in the fire-ant nest, \u201conly here the internal nest consisted of a single unit\u2014the shish-kebab unit.\u201d That is Tschinkel\u2019s description of chambers strung one after another along a single vertical tunnel, giving the cast itself a lumps-along-a-stick appearance. \u201cSo I got the idea of a basic, widespread architectural unit that might be fundamental to many ant nests.\u201d\u00a0\nFire-ant nests are shallow; most of the chambers are linked closely to the core near the surface and come out of the ground pretty much intact. But the trap-jaw ants had built more of a sprawling nest, one that would lose real character\u2014and data\u2014if it was incomplete. Tschinkel had to retrieve all the pieces, and to see it whole, he had to devise a way of gluing and supporting an entire reassembled cast.\nTrachymyrmex septentrionalisRange: Long Island to Illinois; south to the Gulf Coast and FloridaAverage nest depth: 3 feetAverage number of chambers: 2Average colony size: 500 to 1,500 Each egg-shaped chamber in the nest of this agriculturally inclined ant is a garden packed with composted caterpillar droppings, which fertilize the fungus the colony feeds on.Courtesy John Moser, USDA Forest Service, Southern Research Station\nTrachymyrmex septentrionalis\nRange: Long Island to Illinois; south to the Gulf Coast and Florida\nAverage nest depth: 3 feet\nAverage number of chambers: 2\nAverage colony size: 500 to 1,500 \nEach egg-shaped chamber in the nest of this agriculturally inclined ant is a garden packed with composted caterpillar droppings, which fertilize the fungus the colony feeds on.\n\n\nCourtesy John Moser, USDA Forest Service, Southern Research Station\nHe was still pondering the problem when he got interested in the Florida harvester ant\u2014Pogonomyrmex badius, casually known as the pogo. One of the more impressive ant species, the harvester constructs an elaborate, seven-foot-deep nest in less than a week, moving pounds of sand in the process. Then foragers search their territory for seeds, which are stored\u2014as many as 300,000 of them\u2014in subterranean chambers. Workers crush the seeds into pulp and feed it to the larvae. In turn, Tschinkel thinks, the larvae probably return a nourishing liquid to the workers, supplementing their diet of sweet plant exudates, aphid honeydew, and juices sucked from prey insects. Tschinkel\u2019s early attempts to clearly describe the areas in the nests where all this happens were unsuccessful. But in the early 1990s, he found a freshly abandoned pogo nest, and he filled the entire thing with a single five-gallon pour of dental plaster. Once the plaster hardened, the cast came out of the ground\u2014in 180 pieces.\n\u201cI cleaned them up, and they sat on my lab bench for three or four years,\u201d he says. \u201cAssembling it seemed daunting.\u201d But Tschinkel, a hobby woodworker whose house is filled with elegant handmade furniture of his own design, devised a method of gluing the broken casting together with epoxy and mounting the cast in front of a tall plywood backboard, supporting it with projecting steel welding rods so that it would hang in space in the same orientation it occupied in the ground. \u201cI started assembling subunits on the lab table,\u201d he says, and over months\u2014many times longer than it took the ants to build the nest\u2014\u201cI reassembled the cast into perhaps a dozen subunits and then figured out how these went together.\u201d The nest of the harvester colony has 130 chambers connected by about 30 feet of vertical tunnels. \nHe did the same with other species, including Aphaenogaster ashmeadi and Pheidole morrisii, and some of those mounted casts occupy Plexiglas cases outside his office on the Florida State campus. They are, as Tschinkel describes them, \u201cphysically, intellectually, and aesthetically pleasing.\u201d\nTschinkel believes that an ant colony grows just as a single organism does, by rules that guide interactions among its cells and between it and its environment, a process called embryogenesis. A colony is \u201cproduced from the single, mated queen through the rules and interactions of sociogenesis\u201d\u2014the process by which a society grows and changes according to its internal rules. \u201cAnd just as mature organisms differ, reflecting the rules of embryogeny,\u201d he says, mature ant colonies differ as well, reflecting variations in the rules of sociogenesis.\nTschinkel is trying to describe those rules. He studies, for example, how worker size, distribution, and labor patterns change as an ant colony grows, and how labor division by worker size and age helps shape the colony\u2019s structure and habits. Such factors appear to organize the workforce the way a factory floor plan organizes personnel. Young workers start out low in the nest, looking after the brood and the queen, and then move upward as they age, taking on more-responsible jobs\u2014\u201cgeneral nest maintenance, food preparation, seed storage.

That\u2019s a puzzle because it would seem risky: Worker ants tend to kill all but one such queen. Sometimes a mated queen will settle in an orphaned, queenless colony, although she\u2019s unrelated to the workers there, and take over as a kind of royal parasite. Tschinkel has no idea why the workers are willing to serve such a usurper. In addition, a new colony\u2019s workers often steal a brood from other new colonies, whose workers steal it back, and so on, until one colony wins. Then all the workers go and live in the winning nest, thus abandoning a mother.\n\u00a0 Formica pallidafulvaRange: southeastern United States Average nest depth: 1 to 2 feetAverage number of chambers: 15 to 20 Average colony size: 500 to 3,000 Common, but little studied, this inconspicuous ant carries away the excavated dirt from its nest, making a colony difficult to find.

The colony is efficient as well as evasive, building a nest that closely reflects the number of ants within.\n\nCourtesy Alex Wild\n\nAnt-nest design has a basic theme, Tschinkel says: Vertical tunnels for movement and transport, and horizontal chambers for work, storage, and housing the brood. But nests differ in shape, number, size of chambers, and how they\u2019re connected, depending on the species. With the Florida harvester-ant nest, for instance, the largest chambers are near the surface and closely spaced, becoming smaller and farther apart deeper in the ground. Small chambers are oval in shape; larger ones are multilobed and more complex. \nBut exactly how the workers \u201cknow\u201d to generate these shapes is not so obvious. \u201cAs they\u2019re doing the work, each worker responds to what needs to be done,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat are the properties of individual ant workers so that once each has made her contribution, the sum is a particular outcome?\u201d\nOne of Tschinkel\u2019s graduate students, Sasha Mikheyev, analyzed 17 nest casts of Formica pallidafulva. She consistently found that when the descending tunnels are vertical, the adjoining chambers are round, and when the tunnels are inclined, the chambers are oval or teardrop-shaped and lined up along the tunnel\u2019s axis. In a simple way, this observation illustrates one of the rules for how nests are built, Tschinkel says: If a tunnel is vertical, the ants doing the digging tend to distribute themselves evenly as they work, and if it is sloped, they tend to collect in the lower end.\nThat\u2019s a start, but it\u2019s still unknown which workers do the digging, whether they have this directional bias individually or as a group, or how the number of ants may influence nest size and shape. \u201cI can imagine if there are only a few, they might dig only a tunnel, because they wouldn\u2019t be crowded. But if there are more, they might dig chambers too,\u201d Tschinkel says.\nMonths later, on an August morning, Tschinkel is deep in the Apalachicola National Forest with a whole new idea packed into the bed of a pickup truck. Over the years, Tschinkel has cast ant nests with latex, plaster of paris, and dental plaster enhanced with glass fibers. Each has advantages, but none is perfect. So today he\u2019ll be trying something new: molten metal. He has spent months fabricating a clever foundry based on a kiln of fireclay in a galvanized garbage can and an air blower made from an auto heater fan.\nCourtesy of the President and Fellows of Harvard UniversityAphaenogaster ashmeadiRange: southeastern United StatesAverage nest depth: 1 to 2 feetAverage number of chambers: 5 to 8Average colony size: 100 to 200 This scavenger ant, commonly found in woodlands, has an elongated body and forms small colonies.

Meanwhile, he builds a mud dam around the entrance of a pogo nest and blows away loose sand through a plastic tube. Finally, he pours in the molten zinc. It flows so smoothly that Tschinkel worries it might be disappearing down a subterranean rat hole. After waiting 10 minutes for it to cool and harden, he starts digging beside the nest with his favorite shovel.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like buried treasure,\u201d says Kevin Haight, a graduate student, as gleaming metal emerges from the ground. Bristling from some of the tunnels are hairlike projections, perfectly captured\u2014the tunnels of another ant species, the tiny, sneaky thief ant Monomorium viridum, which survives by raiding the broods of other ant species.

The metal cools and sets up before it reaches the bottom of the nest.

There are six known species of fire ants (Solenopsis  spp.) in the United States, three of which are found in Arizona. These three species are the southern fire ant (S. xyloni), and two species of desert fire ant (S. aurea and S. amblychila). RIFA has not established in Arizona, but is present in the bordering states of New Mexico and California. It was discovered  near Yuma, Arizona but was exterminated. \nRIFA are small but highly aggressive. They inject a necrotising, alkaloid venom when they sting. The stings result in painful, itchy, and persistent pustules, and sometimes in severe allergic reactions. Five million people are stung each year in the southeastern United States. About 25,000 of these people  require medical consultation. When a fire ant mound is disturbed, workers boil to the surface, run up any legs, arms, etc. in the vicinity, grab the victim's skin in their mandibles and sting synchronously in response to the slightest movement. The attacks are coordinated and dozens or even hundreds of workers sting in unison. \nFire ants live in colonies that may have 100,000 to 500,000 ants. The queen of the colony can lay from 1500 to 5000 eggs per day, never leaves the nest and can live for many years. Worker ants take care of the queen and her eggs, build the nest, defend the colony, and find food. Preferred food of fire ants consists of protein-rich sources such as insects and seeds. Winged male and female ants fly from the colony in the spring and summer to mate in the air. The males die and the females become queens that start new colonies. \nOnly the red imported fire ant has a median clypeal tooth and a striated mesepimeron;  these may be difficult to see at first. RIFA also have an antennal scape that nearly reaches the vertex, a post-petiole that is constricted at the back half, and the petiolar process is small or absent. Of the native fire ant species, the southern fire ant (Solenopsis xyloni) looks the most like the red imported fire ant. It can be identified by its brown to black color, well-developed petiolar process, and no median clypeal tooth. Desert fire ants (Solenopsis aurea and  S. amblychila) are both yellowish-red to reddish-yellow and have a well-developed petiolar process. RIFA can also be identified by the proportion of large to small workers in disturbed mounds. If half the workers in disturbed mounds are large and dark, it is RIFA. If only a few large ants appear relative to hundreds of small ants, it is non-RIFA. \n Table: Characteristics of RIFA and RIFA mounds \n\u00a0 \n\u00a0 \nWhy is it a Threat?  \nRIFA colonies are extremely destructive. They dominate their home ranges due to their large numbers and aggressiveness. The lack of natural enemies results in population booms in areas they invade. \nRIFA alter the composition of the ecological communities in the areas they invade. They outcompete and frequently eliminate native fire ants. They also compete with other animals for food and alter abundance of prey species. RIFA attack eggs and young of many bird and reptile species. In areas of high infestation, RIFA have significantly reduced northern bobwhite quail populations (Allen et al. 1995) and may completely eliminate ground-nesting species from a given area (Vinson and Sorenson 1986). They also attack small mammals such as rodents and have been known to attack and sometimes kill newborn deer and cattle. Due to a 10-20 year lapse before bird population reductions are observed, it is suggested that actual effects of RIFA on animal populations may be underestimated (Mount 1981). Natural plant ecosystems could potentially be impacted as well. RIFA predates upon solitary bees that are pollinators of certain plants (Vinson 1997) and move and feed on large quantities of seeds. \nStings from RIFA create health problems for many humans. Fire ants sting repeatedly and venom is injected from the poison sac with each sting. RIFA venom has a high concentration of toxins that cause an intense burning and itching that lasts for an hour and is followed by a blister that becomes a white pustule. Broken or scratched pustules can result in secondary bacterial infections and permanent scars. In some individuals, severe allergic reactions can occur resulting in anaphylactic shock and even death (Dowell et al. 1997). \nRIFA cost the US billions of dollars a year in damage to agricultural crops and equipment, livestock, wildlife, public health, and electrical equipment such as air conditioners, traffic signal boxes, electrical and utility units, telephone junctions, airport landing lights, electric pumps for oil and water wells, computers, and even car electrical systems. Control methods for RIFA are extremely costly. \nDistribution  \nRIFA are native to South America and were brought to the US sometime around the 1930's. They now occupy more than 275 million acres of land in the US and are found in Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, South Carolina, North Carolina, Texas, Louisiana, Tennessee, New Mexico , Oklahoma, and California. They invade via transported nursery stock, honeybee colonies, and on empty trailers and trucks. Cold temperatures may limit the northward spread of RIFA in the US and the westward spread may be limited by drier conditions. Natural dispersal occurs on flowing water. Areas with seasonal flooding are vulnerable to RIFA invasion. \nIn infested areas, colonies are common in lawns, gardens, school yards, parks, roadsides, and golf courses. Nests generally occur in sunny, open areas and are most common in disturbed and irrigated soil. RIFA mounds are 4 to 24 inches tall and have no visible surface entrance. Mounds are accessed through subterranean tunnels that spoke out from the central mound. Non-RIFA mounds rarely exceed an inch or 2 in height. RIFA mounds have a fresh-tilled appearance, especially after a rain. \nHistory \n\nRIFA are believed to have arrived in the southern United States around the 1930's on ships from South America as ballast waters were dumped or goods were unloaded. Their range expanded rapidly and today they occupy 13 US states and Puerto Rico . \n RIFA is a regulated species in Arizona. To keep RIFA out of Arizona, the Arizona Department of Agriculture has been conducting surveys at high-risk sites such as nurseries, parks, truck stops, etc. In 2004, all samples collected were negative for RIFA. The drier climate in Arizona is a limitation for this species, however, as we irrigate more lawns, agricultural fields, and golf courses, we increase our chances of a successful RIFA invasion. Once RIFA has established in an area, the chances of eradicating it are slim and control becomes the primary means of fighting its spread. It is vital that we prevent the spread of this species. RIFA very easily travel in potted plants and soil and in our vehicles. If RIFA is detected, citizens should contact the Arizona Department of Agriculture for confirmation and eradication. Eradication methods are complex due to the life cycle of the species and should be conducted by trained individuals. \n Arizona Department of Agriculture Red Imported Fire Ant Update \nInvasivespecies.gov \u0096 a gateway to Federal efforts concerning invasive species \nTexas Imported Fire Ant Research and Management Project \nUniversity of Florida Red Imported Fire Ant Site \nUS Department of Agriculture APHIS Imported Fire Ant Information \nReferences \n Allen, CR, Lutz RS, and Demarais S. 1995.

If a mound is disturbed, hundreds of ants immediately rush out, climb on whatever disturbed them, including humans, and sting. There is some debate about what triggers the ants to sting at the same time instead of individually. Generally, it will take 10 to 20 seconds after climbing up on the victim for the stinging to begin.\nSingle worker ants can bite and sting several times. The worker attaches to the skin with its chewing mouth parts (mandibles) pulling the skin, pinching it, and raising it slightly. This causes a pricking sensation. Then the ant arches its back, doubling under its abdomen, and forces the stinger into the skin. After inflicting the first sting, it may remove the stinger and, rotating or pivoting the head, may sting several more times, leaving a circular pattern of sting sites.\nMany ants can sting a person at the same time. Because large numbers of worker ants are together in a nest, incidents usually involve multiple stings. When a person disturbs a fire ant mound by stepping into it, hundreds of ants can rapidly crawl (1.6 cm per second) up the person's leg. Within seconds, they begin stinging almost simultaneously. Multiple stings can lead to severe medical reactions, even in people with normal immune systems. Infants, neurologically compromised people, the elderly, and otherwise immobile or unaware individuals are at a higher risk of multiple stinging incidents. Such people should not be left alone in fire ant infested areas.\n\nStinger - The stinger on worker ants is a modified egg-laying structure called an  ovipositor. Worker ants are sterile females incapable of producing eggs, so their ovipositors are stingers. Male ants, wasps, and bees do not possess stingers.\nPoison gland - A poison gland containing venom is attached to the stinger. Queen and winged reproductive (unmated queen) ants also have a poison gland. However, they do not use their ovipositors as stingers, as do worker ants.\nVenom - The venom of imported fire ants is produced in the poison gland. It contains two major components:  alkaloids and  proteins. The oily aliphatic alkaloids (i.e., the  piperidine alkaloid, Solenopsin A) are toxic to cells. Piperidine is a relative of piperine, the main chemical ingredient in black pepper.\nThe piperidine toxin kills the cells at the site of injection and causes a burning sensation. This causes the body's defensive white blood cells to accumulate at the injection site, forming a white pustule. If the skin is broken by scratching, bacteria may enter, causing an infection.\nThe venom also contains a protein (less than 1 percent) that has little or no effect on most people. However, for those who are sensitive to these proteins, a sting can lead to a major allergic reaction called anaphylaxis, the most severe type being anaphylactic shock. Left untreated, anaphylactic shock can lead to death within minutes.\n\nPeople vary greatly in their sensitivity to fire ant stings, with some claiming to be resistant to the venom. Others are hypersensitive to venom or may have other medical conditions (e.g., heart conditions, diabetes) that can result in serious medical problems or even death from a single sting. Secondary bacterial infection can also occur, sometimes requiring longer-term medical attention. While most people can tolerate many stings, severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) occur in less than 1 percent of people stung by fire ants.\nLocalized skin reaction to venom. The site of the sting hurts for a few minutes and then reddens; then it swells into a bump or hive within 20 minutes. The intense burning sensation that occurs when the venom is injected accounts for the popular name of \"fire ant.\"\nWithin several hours to a day after being stung, most people develop white, fluid-filled pustules. No other ants are known to cause this type of reaction. The pustules last for several days, and they may become infected and require medical attention. For most people, the pustules dry up in several weeks, but for some people the pustules may lead to a brown scar that can last for many months or become permanent. Although stings are not usually life-threatening, they can be easily infected if the skin is broken.\nWhole body reactions. The symptoms of anaphylaxis can include dizziness, nausea, sweating, low blood pressure, headache, and shortness of breath. If even one of these symptoms occurs, the person requires immediate medical attention. Anaphylactic shock can lead to death. People who show symptoms associated with anaphylactic shock should seek advice from an allergist before entering known fire ant infested areas. Other syndromes that have been attributed to fire ant stings include neuropathy, seizures, cerebrovascular incidents, and nephrotic syndrome.\nSource: Fire Ant Project Fact Sheet, Medical Problems and Treatment Considerations for Red Imported Fire Ant Stings\n\nRemove the stinging ants. Because worker ants use their jaws (mandibles) to gain leverage to sting, they are fixed tightly to the skin or clothing. Merely jumping into water or running water across ants from a spigot will not remove them. The best method is to rub them off briskly by hand or using a cloth.\nFor minor stinging incidents. With the only symptoms being pain and the development of pustules, stings can be treated with over-the-counter products that relieve pain and prevent infection. For more information, consult your pharmacist or physician.\nFor severe stinging incidents. If a sting causes severe chest pain, nausea, severe sweating, loss of breath, serious swelling, or slurred speech, the person should be taken to an emergency medical facility immediately.\n\n \nSource: Fire Ant Project Fact Sheet,\u00a0Welcome to Texas!

A Fire Ant Stung Me! - KidsHealth", "http://kidshealth.org/kid/ill_injure/bugs/fire_ant.html", "Skip Navigation\n\nThere are many different types of fire ants, and they are found all throughout the southeastern and southwestern United States. The most common and aggressive kind is the red imported fire ant, which is reddish-brown and measures about 1/8-inch long (about half the size of a pencil eraser).\nRed imported fire ants live in colonies that first nest in the ground, and then create a mound of dirt over the nest. These mounds can grow up to 18 inches high and over 2 feet wide!\nRed imported fire ants' nests can be found on lawns, in parks, on playgrounds, in fields, and in pastures. Some red imported fire ants create nests in walls of buildings.\nA person who gets stung by a fire ant will feel a sharp pain and burning. A person who steps on a fire ant mound will get a lot of stings at once because the ants have been disturbed where they all live together. Each sting will turn into an itchy white blister over the next day.\nIf you ever think that you have been stung by a fire ant, tell an adult immediately. That's because the venom (poison) in the fire ants' stings can cause the area of the sting to swell up quite a bit, and a doctor may want to have a look to make sure you are not having an allergic reaction.\nThe symptoms of an allergic reaction include hives (red patches on the skin that sting and itch), nausea, dizziness, a tight feeling in the throat, or difficulty breathing. If these symptoms occur, the person needs to get medical attention right away.\nBut more often, you can follow these steps after a fire ant sting:\nA doctor may suggest giving a medicine called an antihistamine to control swelling and itching. If you are having a more severe allergic reaction to a fire ant sting, he or she may give you a shot that fights the reaction. People who know that they are allergic to fire ant stings also sometimes carry emergency medicine that they can give to themselves to prevent a severe reaction from happening.\nThe best way to avoid getting bitten by fire ants is to keep your shoes on when playing near fire ant mounds. If you come across one, don't ever poke at it or try to play with it.\nReviewed by: Elana Pearl Ben-Joseph, MD\nDate reviewed: April 2013\nNote: All information on KidsHealth\u00ae is for educational purposes only.

The tropical fire ant,  Solenopsis geminata Fabricius, and the southern fire ant,  S. xyloni McCook, are considered species \"native\" to the area.  The two imported species of fire ants were introduced into the United  States from South America at the port of Mobile, Alabama. The black  imported fire ant, Solenopsis richteri Forel, arrived sometime  around 1918 and the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta Buren, in the late 1930's. The presence of imported fire ants in the  United States was first reported in 1929 by Loding. Both species  probably came to the port in soil used as ballast in cargo ships. In  the years preceding the arrival of the red imported fire ant, the  black imported fire ant slowly spread into adjacent counties in  Alabama and Florida. Since its introduction, the red imported fire  ant, a much more aggressive species than the black imported fire ant,  has spread quickly. By the time of the first official survey carried  out by the USDA in 1953, imported fire ants had invaded 102 counties  in 10 states (Culpepper 1953). Today, the red imported fire ant has  spread throughout the southeastern United States and Puerto Rico (Fig. 1) replacing the  two native species and displacing the black imported fire ant.  Currently, S. richteri is found only in extreme northeast  Mississippi, northwest Alabama and a few southern counties in  Tennessee.\n\r\n  Imported fire ants disperse naturally through mating flights, colony  movement or by rafting to new sites during periodic floods. It is  through the actions of man, however, that the dramatic spread of  imported fire ants has occurred. Beginning soon after the Second  World War, and in conjunction with the housing boom of the period,  the imported fire ant began its march across the South. The spread of  these ants was largely due to the movement of grass sod and woody  ornamental plants used in landscaping. This inadvertent movement of  S. invicta and S. richteri was noted by the U.S.  Department of Agriculture in 1953 when a direct link was established  between commercial plant nurseries and the spread of imported fire  ants. In response to mounting public pressure, the U.S. Congress  appropriated $2.4 million in 1957 for control and eradication  efforts. As part of an overall plan a quarantine was imposed to  retard or prevent the artificial dissemination of these now notorious  pests. On May 6th 1958, regulations governing the movement of nursery  stock, grass sod and some other items were instituted through the  Federal Quarantine 301.81 (Canter 1981). By that time, however,  imported fire ants had moved into eight southern states. This spread,  although slowed considerably by federal regulations and climatic  conditions, continues even today. In recent years, isolated  infestations of imported fire ants have been found as far west as  California and as far north as Kansas and Maryland.\nAnts belonging to the genus Solenopsis can readily be  distinguished from all other ant species in North America by their  10-segmented antennae with a 2-segmented club. These characteristics,  combined with the presence of a sting, a two-segmented pedicel and an  unarmed propodeum make identification of the genus relatively easy.  Identification of individuals to the species level is somewhat more  difficult; made more so by the hybridization between the two \"native\"  species as well as between the two imported species.\n\r\nColonies of fire ants consist of eggs, brood, polymorphic workers,  winged males, winged females and one or more reproductive queens.  Among the sterile workers, labor is divided by age (and to a much  lesser degree by size). Younger workers are assigned the job of  caring for the developing brood; middle-aged workers are tasked with  colony maintenance and protection while the eldest workers forage for  food.\nPhotograph: Alate fire ant\nAlate, or winged forms, are most  abundant in the late spring and early summer but can be found at any  time of the year. The winged forms are reproductives. Males, easily  distinguished from female alates, are decidedly smaller, glossy black  and have a small head (Fig.  2). Although both alate males and females can be found in the  same colony; as a general rule one form will be dominant. Nuptial  flights most often occur in the middle of the morning one or two days  following a rainfall; if the temperature is above 22\u00b0C and the  wind is light. The males fly first and await the females in the air.  The female alates emerge and take flight climbing up into the cloud  of waiting males where they mate in the air. After mating, the male  dies and the newly mated female lands, sheds her now useless wings  and begins searching for a suitable nesting site. The new queen  excavates a brood cell approximately 25-50 mm below the surface  of the soil. Often more than one new queen will occupy the same cell  but only one will survive to establish a colony. Queens do not forage  for food but rely on fat reserves and the energy acquired from  absorbing her wing muscles to survive until her first workers are  ready to take on the task of colony maintenance. Initially, the new  queen will oviposit 10-15 eggs. These hatch in 7-10 days  and are fed by the queen through trophallaxis (exchange of alimentary  fluids) or from sterile, trophic eggs she has laid for that purpose.  In 6-10 days, the larvae pupate and emerge 10-15 days  later. These workers, called minims, are very small due to the  limited amount of energy the queen could devote to their development.  These small workers open the brood cell to the outside world and  begin foraging for food to feed the queen and the developing brood.  Within 30 days, larger workers have emerged and the colony begins to  grow. Workers start to emerge daily and within six months several  thousand workers can occupy the colony and a \"mound\" is readily  visible. As the colony matures, the polymorphic nature of the worker  becomes more apparent. The largest workers in the colony (majors) can  be as much as 10 times the size of the smallest workers (media) (Fig. 3). The queen lives up  to seven years and produces an average of 1600 eggs per day  throughout her life. At maturity, a monogynous fire ant colony can  consist of over 250,000 ants.\nPhotograph: Fire ant mound\nOne of the identifying  characteristics of a fire ant colony is the earthen nest or mound.  The mound is a conically-shaped dome of excavated soil that has a  hard, rain-resistant crust. The mound averages 0.40 m in diameter and  0.25 m in height. In heavier soils, a mound can exceed 1.0 m in  height and 1.5 m in diameter. There are usually no external openings  in the mound; tunnels approximately 25-50 mm below the surface  radiate from the mound allowing foraging workers ready egress and  ingress. The purpose of the mound is three-fold: 1) to be a flight  platform for nuptial flights; 2) to raise the colony above the water  table in saturated ground and; 3) to act as a passive solar collector  to supply warmth to the colony during the cold winter months.  Although mound size and shape differs to some extent based on soil  type, during the dry hot days of late summer and early fall, new  mounds are not formed and older mounds are not maintained. While  mounds are important to a colony, they are not essential for colony  survival. Given a dark, protected site with sufficient moisture and  an adequate supply of food, fire ants will nest in a wide variety of  sites (e.g. rotten logs, walls of buildings, under sidewalks  and roads, in automobiles, in dried cow manure).\nFire ants are omnivorous, feeding on almost any plant or animal  material; although insects seem to be their preferred food. In rural  habitats, fire ants have a major impact on ground nesting animals  from insects to reptiles to birds to mammals. The arrival of imported  fire ants into an ecosystem wrecks havoc on the local ecological  community. Studies (Allen et al. 1995) have shown that a  minimum two-fold reduction occurs among populations of field mice,  oviparous snakes, turtles and other vertebrates when imported fire  ants are allowed to establish colonies within a given area. In some  instances, the depredation by fire ants has completely eliminated  some species from an ecosystem (Porter & Savignano 1990). The  reduction or elimination of a species or group of species from a  system has repercussions throughout the local food web. Not only do  imported fire ants reduce animal populations, they also feed on  plants. Fire ants attack young saplings and seedlings. They destroy  buds and developing fruits and have been shown to feed on the seeds  of 139 species of native wildflowers and grasses (Lockley unpubl.).  Secondarily, fire ants \"nurse\" numerous homopteran pests of plants  such as aphids and scale insects. Although not conclusively shown,  observations indicate that their activity on the plant itself may  reduce the ability of pollinators to successfully pollinate  flowers.\n\r\nIn agriculture, fire ants have been identified as damaging  fifty-seven species of cultivated plants (Adams 1986). Fire ants feed  on the germinating seeds of some crops (e.g. corn, sorghum,  soybeans) and the buds and developing fruits of others (e.g.  citrus, okra). Tunneling fire ants have galleried Russet potato  tubers and have significantly damaged the subterranean pods of  peanuts. Young citrus and pecan trees have been destroyed when  imported fire ants girdled stems and trunks. Damage to plants is  exacerbated during periods of drought as fire ants seek alternate  water sources. In fields where drip irrigation is used, fire ants  will build their mounds over the emitters reducing or blocking the  flow of water to crops. In some cases, actual physical destruction of  microsprinkler pulsator assemblies has occurred (Boman et al.  1995). Finally, the mere presence of fire ants on plants and within  the field will deter hand-harvesting of fruits and vegetables.\n\r\nAs an urban pest, imported fire ants cause many of the same problems  experienced in rural areas as well as some problems unique to the  urban environment. As in agriculture, imported fire ants cause  significant damage to numerous plants and, as in rural habitats, fire  ants can reduce the number of birds and mammals in an urban  landscape. Fire ants nest within urban structures such as the walls  of homes and offices. They establish colonies under sidewalks and  roadways. When the site is abandoned, subsidence will cause cracks to  appear and will occasionally result in the complete collapse of  sections of these structures. The presence of fire ants can deter  outdoor activities in yards, parks and school grounds. Home invasions  can threaten small children and the elderly. House invasions are  especially prevalent during periods of heavy precipitation and  flooding. Fire ant colonies have been found inside automobiles,  trucks and recreation vehicles (Collins et al. 1993). Traffic  accidents have been caused by fire ants stinging the drivers of  automobiles. Victims of highway accidents can be attacked by fire  ants if they are thrown from their vehicles.\n\r\nImported fire ants are attracted by electrical currents and have  caused considerable damage to heat pumps, air conditioners, telephone  junction boxes, transformers, traffic lights, gasoline pumps, et  cetera.\n\nPhotograph: Fire ant sting\nFire ants are most notorious for  their stinging behaviour. They respond rapidly and aggressively to  any disturbance of the colony or to a food source. A single fire ant  can sting repeatedly (Fig.  5) and will continue to do so even after their venom sac has been  depleted. Initially, the sting(s) result in a localized intense  burning sensation (hence the name \"fire\" ant). This is followed  within 24 - 48 hours by the formation of a white pustule at the sting  site (Fig. 6). This pustule  is formed only in response to the stinging of the two imported  species. No pustule forms from the stings of native species. These  pustules can become sites of secondary infection if not kept clean  and can leave permanent scarring.\u00a0 \n\nPhotograph: Pustules resulting from fire ant stings\nA  minority of those stung by fire ants are hypersensitive to the venom  and can react quite strongly; suffering chest pains, nausea,  dizziness, shock or, in rare cases, lapsing into coma. Some deaths  have been documented as having been caused by fire ant stings but  these cases are extremely rare.\nWhile any attempts to control imported fire ants over large areas  are currently impractical, there are two basic methods that can  successfully control fire ants within a limited area: treatment of  individual mounds and broadcast treatments.\n Individual Mound Treatments\r\n          There are several proven methods that  can be employed to control individual colonies of fire ants.  Insecticidal mound drenches with common insecticides are generally  effective against fire ant colonies. The mound is flooded with a  large volume of a liquid containing a contact insecticide such as  carbaryl, diazinon, dursban, et cetera. Numerous insecticides  are currently labeled for this use. A major problem with this method  is that the queen is sometimes too deep within the colony to be  contacted by the toxicant. Care must be taken not to disturb the  mound prior to application of the drench. A disturbance will alert  the colony and the queen may be taken deeper into the mound.  Application of insecticidal surface dusts or granules have a limited  effect on a colony if they are not watered in. The dissolved granules  must come into direct contact with the ants to have any effect. As in  mound drenches, care must be taken not to disturb the colony prior to  application. The queen can be taken to a point within the mound where  she may not come in contact with the poison. Some insecticides are  marketed as injectants. These are usually more effective than surface  applications or mound drenches but are also more expensive and can be  dangerous if not handled properly. Fumigants are also commercially  available. Again, they are expensive and dangerous if not handled  properly. A number of fire ant baits are available. These can be used  for treating individual mounds or for broadcast treatment of larger  areas. The bait should be uniformly applied around the mound 0.3 to  1.0 meters away and not on the mound itself. Baits are much slower  than the control methods listed above but are generally safer,  cheaper and more effective in the long run.\n\nBroadcast Treatments\r\n          A number of fire ant baits are commercially  available for broadcast treatments. Baits are composed of an inert  pregelled corn carrier and soybean oil. A toxicant (either a  slow-acting insecticide or an insect growth regulator) is  incorporated into the oil. Foragers find the bait and carry it back  to the colony. Once there, the ants will ingest the soybean  oil/toxicant and begin feeding other members of the colony.  Eventually, the toxicant is spread throughout the mound and all  members of the colony are affected. Broadcasting baits has a number  of advantages. Unlike individual mound treatments, colonies need not  be \"located\" in order for them to be treated. Foraging workers  quickly retrieve the broadcast granules and carry them back to their  nestmates. Broadcasting baits is a great deal less labor intensive  than individual treatments and per acre costs are dramatically lower  than with any of the other methods. Some of the disadvantages to  broadcasting baits include: lack of specificity to fire ants; baits  dissolve when they come in contact with water rendering them  irretrievable by fire ants; retrieval of the baits is temperature  dependent; and baits are slow-acting.\n\nBiological Control\r\n          A large number of arthropod species have been  identified from nests of imported fire ants. Unfortunately, the vast  majority are transients and seem to have no specific relationship  with the ants (Collins 1992). However, many of these are known to be  endoparasitic, socially parasitic or predaceous (Silviera-Guido et  al. 1973, Williams 1980) and studies continue evaluating their  effectiveness. Fungal, protozoan and viral pathogens have also been  identified in association with fire ants (Jouvenaz 1983). Three  potential biological control agents have been identified in South  America for intensive study. These studies, if successful, may lead  to their introduction into the United States. The organisms under  consideration are: Pseudacteon sp. flies (Diptera: Phoridae)  ca. 17 spp.; Thelohania solenopsae a protozoan disease and; Solenopsis dagerrei (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), a workerless  social parasite.\n\r\n          Phorid flies are known to be parasitic on a number of ant species.  Some are thought to be host specific to imported fire ants. The adult  flies oviposit on foraging fire ant workers outside the mound; the  maggots migrate into the ant's head capsule where they feed. This  eventually leads to decapitation of the ant. As interesting as this  phenomena is, the major effect of these flies is to cause the ants to  cease foraging. In the presence of the fly, worker ants will retreat  into the colony to prevent oviposition by the phorid. This disruptive  response to the fly restricts the ability of the colony to feed  itself and may \"even the playing field\" so that other ant species can  become more competitive with fire ants.\n\r\n          The microsporidian disease Thelohania solenopsae is an  obligate intracellular pathogen of fire ants. Preliminary field  studies on populations of the black imported fire ant, S.  richteri, carried out in Argentina indicated that decreasing  densities of fire ants were associated with increasing presence of  this pathogen. These data suggest that this pathogen may be an  important factor in reducing fire ant numbers by weakening the  colonies. Although the vertical transmission of this disease is  understood, the horizontal transmission is not.\n\nSolenopsis (Labauchena) dagerrei is a parasitic ant that  attaches to the fire ant queen and redirects fire ant workers to tend  the brood of the parasite to the detriment of the colony's own  larvae. S. dagerrei is intriguing because it lacks a worker  caste; only queens and males are produced. The presence of this  parasitic ant has a debilitating effect on colony growth and the  proportion of sexual reproductives produced in the colony. Queens of  S. dagerrei enter fire ant colonies and attach themselves to  the mother queen. Previous studies have demonstrated that this  parasite inhibits the fire ant queen and her egg production; thus  causing the fire ant colony to collapse and eventually die out.\n\r\n        To date, none of these natural enemies has been sufficiently  evaluated to determine if, in and of themselves, they might produce  any true suppression of fire ant populations. In all likelihood,  parasites, predators and pathogens will be used in combinations to  reduce colony fitness. Reduction in colony vitality could cause  greater mortality under stress conditions and allow for better  competition from native ant species.\nControl  of the Red Imported Fire Ant\n\nEcoLink:  The Red Imported Fire Ant by Wendee Holtcamp\n\nUsing  phorid flies in the biocontrol of imported fire ants in Texas\nAdams, C.T. 1986.

The initial spread of these ants resulted from the movement of infested soil and container plants to uninfested areas. The ant was also found in almond groves in the Central Valley, apparently brought in with honey bee hives from Texas. Once established, the ant spread rapidly by flight of the reproductives.\nRed imported fire ant workers are variable in size (1/16 to 1/5 inch long) and are dark reddish brown. Our native southern fire ant (Solenopsis xyloni) is about the same size and color as the red imported fire ant.  On the other hand, California harvester ant (Pogonomyrmex californicus) workers are all the same size (1/5 inch long) and are red in color (many people refer to these as red ants). The most common ant found around homes in southern California is the Argentine ant, Linepithema humile, a small grayish black ant that is uniform in size (1/10 inch long) and is seen moving along in long trails.\nThere are several physical characteristics that distinguish red imported fire ants from most other common ant species found in California, including the number of nodes on its narrow waist and segments on the antennae. The characteristic that definitively separates the red imported fire ant from other fire ants is the number of clypeal teeth on its head, a feature that is best viewed under a microscope. The red imported fire ant has 3 clypeal teeth, whereas the native fire ant, Solenopsis xyloni, only has two lateral teeth.  However, the quickest way to recognize this pest is to observe its aggressive behavior when its nest is disturbed. Red imported fire ants will quickly climb onto and sting anything touching their mound or food source.\nUndisturbed red imported fire ant mounds are frequently dome-shaped and can be 1 ft high. In California red imported fire ant mounds frequently resemble gopher mounds because they consist of a circular upwelling of loose soil, but they may not extend as far above the surface. This flattened appearance results from the fact that their mounds are frequently on irrigated turf where mowing cuts off the raised part of the mound.  These mounds readily distinguish red imported fire ant colonies from other California ant species. Nests of the native southern fire ant, for instance, are usually irregular in shape and consist of scattered soil with multiple obscure entrances. In some instances red imported fire ants do not build mounds but nest in places such as rotten logs, walls of buildings, under sidewalks, and in outdoor electric and water utility boxes.\nThe red imported fire ant life cycle, like that of other social Hymenoptera (ants, bees, and wasps), consists of four main stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. The egg, larval, and pupal stages occur within the underground nest and are only seen when nests are disturbed or when they are being carried to a different location by workers. \nThe eggs are almost too small to be seen with the unaided eye. They hatch into the grublike larvae that are fed by the workers. There are four larval instars (stages); the fourth larval instar is particularly important because it is the only stage that can ingest solid food. Once the larvae finish their growth, they molt into pupae, which look like adults except that their legs and antennae are held tightly against the body. These pupae are initially white but begin to turn darker as they mature. In the final molt the pupa becomes an adult.\nMost larvae develop into sterile worker ants, all of them female and wingless. However, some larvae in the colony receive extra food during their development and become much larger than the larvae destined to become workers. These larger larvae will develop into reproductives. \nIn California reproductives are produced throughout the year, with the greatest number in the spring. Mating flights can occur any time conditions are favorable. The female reproductives are future queens and have wings. Male larvae develop into winged adults  that are black in color and have a smaller head with antennae that are not elbowed as in the females. During a mating flight, the winged males and females fly and mate in midair before falling back to the ground. Males die shortly afterward; the mated queens remove their wings and dig a small hole in the soil and seal themselves inside. In the nest, the queens begin to lay eggs that develop into small worker ants in about one month.\nSome fire ant colonies have only one queen per nest and are called monogyne colonies. Others can have many queens and are called polygyne colonies. The polygyne colony may be more difficult to control because all the queens must be killed to prevent the colony from surviving. Polygyne colonies frequently expand by budding; i.e., some of the queens and workers start a new mound nearby. This process accounts for much higher mound densities for polygyne colonies than for monogyne colonies, sometimes approaching 1,000 mounds per acre in pastures in the southeastern United States.\nThe red imported fire ant's sting is a serious concern to people and their pets. Venom injected into the skin causes a burning sensation (hence the name fire ant). Both southern fire ants and red imported fire ants become very agitated when their nests are disturbed, but red imported fire ants are much more aggressive and can quickly climb onto the object or person causing the disturbance and begin stinging. A single red imported fire ant can bite and sting  its victim repeatedly. Symptoms start as a burning and itching sensation followed by the formation of a white pustule, which takes several weeks to disappear. The pustules can become infected if not kept clean and may leave permanent scarring.\nA small percentage of the human population is allergic to these stings. If a person experiences chest pains, nausea, dizziness, or shock, he or she should seek emergency medical assistance immediately after a stinging incident. Avoid medical emergencies by teaching children and visitors about fire ants.\nFire ants feed on almost any plant or animal material, including other insects, ticks, ground-nesting animals, young trees, seedlings, plant buds, developing fruits, and seeds. In addition to  stings, the red imported fire ant causes problems by building its nests around trees, yard plants, pipes, and in the walls of structures. Colony-building can damage plants, lawns, and outdoor electrical fixtures.\nBecause fire ants can sting en masse, most people will want to keep them off their property. This contrasts with other common ant species, such as the Argentine ant, where the primary goal is to keep them out of homes. For management of household ants, see Pest Notes: Ants.\nThe red imported fire ant is a quarantined pest in California. If you suspect that the ant is on your property, you can call a statewide toll-free number staffed by the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) (1-888-4FIREANT or 1-888-434-7326) to help get the pest identified by someone in your area. There is also an informative fire ant website. If you are in an area where the fire ant has not been previously established, contact CDFA or the local Agricultural Commissioner for help and do not attempt your own control program. \nIn Southern California's Orange County and in the Coachella Valley, the Vector Control Districts have active fire ant control programs and will assist residents with treatment. In Los Angeles County, the county Agricultural Commissioner may provide treatment in some areas. In other areas and in Riverside County, residents may be responsible for their own treatment. Hiring a licensed pest control operator is strongly recommended because licensed professionals have access to the most effective management products and experience in controlling this pest.\nFor professionals and residents carrying out their own management programs, fire ant baits are recommended because they are inexpensive, highly effective, and safe for the environment. Using bait allows the foraging ants to carry the poison back to the nest and the rest of the colony. Spraying insecticide on foraging ants will not control a colony and spraying a nest may cause the colony to disperse, which could make control more difficult.\nMost fire ant baits consist of a yellow matrix of de-gelled corn grits that are coated with soybean oil containing the toxicant. Baits should be put out when ants are seen walking on the ground (temperatures from 70\u00b0 to 90\u00b0F are best). You can check if fire ants are active by putting out a piece of greasy food (potato chip or Spam) and checking it in about 30 minutes.\nIn hotter weather baits are best applied in the evening. The ants will then forage overnight on the bait. Baits lose their effectiveness quickly with extreme heat, water, and sunlight. Fresh bait from an unopened container works best; an opened package may remain fresh for only a couple of weeks. Furthermore, the ground should be dry to avoid further deterioration of the baits. On watered turf, in most cases a couple of hours without irrigation should be sufficient.\nMost fire ant baits are broadcast at 1.5 lbs per acre (about 20 bait particles per square foot) and are unlikely to pose a threat to people or animals at these rates. Labels should be carefully followed with regard to where and when these baits should be applied and special care taken to avoid application on hard surfaces or other areas where baits can be washed into storm drains.\nFor long-term control, bait containing an insect growth regulator (IGR), such as Distance, is recommended. However, IGRs are slow-acting, requiring 4 to 6 weeks for maximum efficacy. If quicker results are desired, a corn-grit bait containing hydramethylnon, such as Amdro Pro, can be used. It will give good results within one week or less. Table 1 lists some of the common bait products available for controlling ants.\nTo ensure you are using a bait optimized for fire ants, check the product label for the words \"fire ant bait.\" Many of these products are available only to licensed professionals.\nNot listed in Table 1 are plastic bait stations containing various insecticides. These small stations are generally more useful for indoor use against other ant species and are not likely to have much effect on large outdoor infestations of fire ants.\nProducts not labeled as fire ant baits, such as mound treatments and broadcast granules  containing cyfluthrin, deltamethrin, pyrethrin, acephate, d-limonene, permethrin, bifenthrin and lambda-cyhalothrin, are not recommended. These products may give a quick reduction in visible ants, but they generally kill only foraging workers and do not give good long-term results in reducing the colony. Many of these products also have greater potential of running into groundwater than do the baits, and all the pyrethroid products have been found in urban creeks at levels toxic to aquatic wildlife. \nIf you hire a pest control operator, the merits of the different treatments with respect to efficacy and safety for the environment should be discussed before treatments are applied.

In the 1930's, red imported fire ants made their way to the U.S. from Argentina, via the port of Mobile, Alabama. Red imported fire ants will defend their nest aggressively, emerging en masse and stinging the offending perpetrator. Solenopsis invicta is now established throughout the southeastern states. Isolated populations also exist in California and the southwest.\nEntomologically speaking, fire ants is the common name given to about 20 species of ants belonging to the genus Solenopsis. Fire ants sting. Their toxic venom causes a burning sensation, hence the name fire ants.\nIn the U.S., we have four native species of fire ants:\nAnother exotic species, the black import fire ant (Solenopsis richteri) arrived in the U.S. around 1918.

Its common names include red ant and red harvester ant.[1] These large (5\u20137 millimeters) ants prefer arid chaparral habitats and are native to the southwest United States.[2] Nests are made underground (up to 2.5 meters deep) in exposed areas. Their diets consist primarily of seeds, and they consequently participate in myrmecochory, an ant-plant interaction through which the ants gain nutrients and the plants benefit through seed dispersal. Red harvester ants are often mistaken for fire ants, but are not closely related to any fire ant species, native or introduced.\n\n\nRed harvester ant nests are characterized by a lack of plant growth and small pebbles surrounding the entrance to the tunnel, which usually descends at a pronounced angle. Hulls of seeds may however be found scattered around the nest. In grassland areas, such as ranches, the lack of plant life makes red harvester ant colonies very easy to spot, and where they are very plentiful they may make serious inroads into the grazing available to livestock.\nThe mounds are typically flat and broad, 0 to 100\u00a0mm (0.0 to 3.9\u00a0in) high, and 300 to 1,200\u00a0mm (12 to 47\u00a0in) in diameter. There have been reports of even larger denuded areas, on the order of 10\u00a0m2 (110\u00a0sq\u00a0ft). Three to eight trails typically lead away from the mound, like \"arms\". These trails are used by ants to collect and bring food back to the mound. \"Scout\" ants are the first ones out of the mound every morning. They seek food, and mark their path as they return to the mound to alert the worker ants. The worker ants follow the scent trail and collect the food. Other worker ants clean, extend and generally tend to the mound, the queen and the brood. All the ants in the colonies are females apart from the winged males produced in the breeding season.\nThe reproductive unit of ant populations is the colony. A single virgin queen first mates with several males at a reproductive aggregation site formed by male harvester ants. She then flies to a new site to produce an offspring colony.[3]\nThe main food source for red harvester ants usually consists of seeds, which they hoard in great numbers. The food is first ground to a bread-like consistency using the ant's large mandible, and is then stored in a granary, assuring the colony access to food year-round. Seed collection on behalf of the red harvester ants benefits their ecosystem through the process of myrmecochory, in which ants aid in the dispersal of seeds while foraging for food. Both plant and ant benefit from this relationship: the plants increase their dispersal range and density, while the ants benefit from acquiring nutrients and ensuring a more secure food supply in future harvests. This is typically understood as a mutualistic interaction. Dead insects are also collected during foraging.\nMuch research has been done on the foraging behavior of the red harvester ant. Three types of workers are most involved in the foraging process: nest patrollers, trail patrollers, and foragers. On a given day, nest patrollers emerge first from the nest to assess the safety and profitability of foraging. The colony gets the majority of its water from the metabolism of the fats in seeds.[4] If food is scarce, or if it is a particularly hot day, the energy and water benefits of foraging may be outweighed by its energy and water costs. In this case, the colony may be forced to rely on its extensive food stores. Seeds may be stored in the nest for months or even several years.[5]\nThe colony is able to communicate through momentary antennal contact involving the transfer of cuticular hydrocarbons.[6] Other visual, temporal, and olfactory cues may also be involved.[6] Based on the nest patrollers\u2019 reports, trail patrollers may leave the nest to determine the best possible foraging direction. This decision is based upon various economic factors such as food availability and neighboring nests\u2019 foraging behavior. As both types of patrollers return, foragers assess their rates of return to decide whether to leave the nest to find food. In an experiment involving patroller mimics, it was found that a return rate of 1 patroller every 10 seconds stimulated the highest level of foraging activity.[6] This return rate indicates high availability of food and good foraging conditions, and therefore a favorable cost-benefit ratio for the foragers. If the patroller return rate is too high, it may be a warning of danger, such as the sighting of a predatory lizard. A lower return rate could indicate lack of available food, or heavy competition.\nAnt foraging is guided by chemical signals that lead the ants up to 50\u201360\u00a0km (?) from the nest at times.[7][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] Once an ant has decided to forage, it will almost always continue until it has found food to take back to the nest. 90% of returning foragers are \u201csuccessful\u201d.[8] Therefore, forager return rate is a good indicator of food availability. Logically, overall foraging activity is influenced by the rate of returning foragers.[8] When food is plentiful, foragers will quickly find it and immediately return to the nest. Foragers still in the nest will interpret this to mean food searches will be profitable: low energy input with a high chance of a seed reward. Foraging activity will consequently be increased. Likewise, a decline in food availability, indicated by a decrease in forager return rate, will cause the colony to decrease its foraging activity.[6]\nThe ability for a colony to quickly regulate its foraging behavior is quite important since their food source is variable and scattered. This regulatory ability is variable in itself, influenced by food availability, current need to eat, and colony health.[2] Colonies are more likely to adapt to varying forager return rates when the rate of foraging is high, which may be because variances are simply harder to detect during low rates.[2] Overall, the red harvester ant demonstrates a remarkable ability in social cognition, cost-benefit analysis, and behavioral economics.\nHarvester ant populations operate without a centralized control system by means of a decentralized chemical communication system, through the process of chemical signalling. Foraging is regulated using positive and negative feedback loops. When ants return to the colony, this stimulates outgoing foraging. When ants return to the colony at a higher rate with seeds, this in turn causes the outgoing rate of foragers to increase. As fewer ants bearing seeds return to the colony, the rate of outgoing foragers decreases. The result is foraging regulation relative to the abundance of available food at any given time.[9] The interactions between returning and outgoing foragers operates on a timescale of seconds. It typically only took three to eight seconds for an outgoing forager to leave the nest as a result of an increase in successful returning foragers.[10]\nRelative abundance of food available is gauged by the average time spent foraging per seed, rather than the distance traveled to find each seed. Foragers take less time when food is more abundant. Faster foraging signals faster rates of outgoing foragers, maximizing the harvest of food relative to the abundance in the area. Seeds are used as a source of water for ants, and are often kept in the nest for anywhere from a few months to multiple years.[11]\nInterspecies competition exists between harvester ant populations, presenting challenges to successful foraging. One example of this is the competition for access to seed resources between the Novomessor cockerelli and Pogonomyrmex barbatus species of harvester ants. Novomessor cockerelli ants engage in interference competition against Pogonomyrmex barbatus colonies by \"plugging\" entrances to the nest with sand and small rocks. This delays activity of P. barbatus for anywhere from one to three hours, shifting the onset of foraging until later in the day when the temperature is substantially higher. This reduces productivity in two ways; firstly, the ants are delayed and consequently have less time to forage; secondly, high soil temperatures prematurely drive harvest ants back into their nests, shortening the range of possible foraging. Research indicated that the affected Pogonomyrmex barbatus populations did not take efforts to compensate for the interference in their activities, such as by inducing higher rates of foraging. As such, nest plugging by rival species impedes the overall productivity of worker ants in the species Pogonomyrmex barbatus.[12]\nRed harvester ants are eusocial insects, characterized by a high-level of cooperation and an organized division of labor. The worker caste is sterile. As with most ant species, reproduction is performed by a mating caste that consists of winged alates (reproductives) that reside in the nest until weather permits them to fly away and mate. After copulation the male usually dies, while the now-fertilized queen returns to the ground to search for a suitable nesting site. Once she has chosen a site, she sheds her wings and begins to reproduce, creating a new colony. She produces \"worker ants\" for 1\u201320 years until her death. Some Queens have been known to live up to 30 years in the wild.\nIn Pogonomyrmex barbatus, reproductive and non-reproductive tasks are divided into a caste system, as discussed above. Some individuals are specialized for reproductive function while other ants are responsible for non-reproductive roles such as defense, caring for the brood, and foraging for food. Research indicates that the system of division of labor naturally arises in conjunction with the formation of the group, rather than as a secondary adaptation; this was demonstrated by an experiment in which otherwise solitary queen harvest ants were placed in forced association. The results of the study indicated that divisions of labor arose in groups that lack an evolutionary history of such social arrangements.[13]\nWithin non-reproductive Pogonomyrmex barbatus worker ants, five major tasks are performed: foraging, maintenance of the nest, defense, midden work, and convening. Roles are not constant and chemical interactions determine when certain ants engage in certain activities. As such, these tasks are relatively fluid and cannot be understood as separate processes. The transition in behavior on behalf of one group triggers behavioral transitions in other groups of worker ants.[14]\nThe reproductive Pogonomyrmex barbatus caste are responsible for the formation of new colonies. A single queen ant establishes every colony. Large numbers of winged male ants and virgin queen ants fly to mating aggregation sites following mid-summer monsoon rains. In order to found a successful colony, Pogonomyrmex barbatus queens must mate with males from two separate lineages. One lineage results in ants that will become the workers of the colony. These are the ants responsible for the non-reproductive tasks of the colony, including: foraging for food, building and defending the nest, and brood care. The other lineage produces reproductive female ants. After mating with the male ants at the aggregation site, the queen flies away to establish a new colony. Upon arriving at her new nest site, the queen loses her wings and builds a nest in the soil. The entrance into the nest is then sealed off in order to lay her eggs in safety. With this, the colony is born. Over the course of the following six to eight weeks, the primary brood of non-reproductive worker ants emerges and begins to forage and build the colony.[15]\nMating is perennial and species-specific between sub-species of the Red Harvester Ant. Males distinguish reproductive females of their species from females of other species using pheromones. This occurs as a result of sexually stimulating pheromones secreted from the poison-glands of reproductive Pogonomyrmex barbatus females. These pheromones are perfectly detected by males of the species upon physical contact, resulting in the stimulation of sexual behavior.\nMating occurs at reproductive aggregation sites. Secretions from the mandibular glands of males initially mark these sites. The secretions attract females, as well as additional males, resulting in strong male competition for mates. The system of mating within the Pogonomyrmex barbatus species is comparable to lek behavior performed by many vertebrate species. The male ants congregate and collectively give off a pheromone that attracts reproductive females. The more males present to give off the pheromone, the stronger the attraction for the females. Although this practice strongly favors certain males and leaves many others without mates, the congregation of males attracts more females on the whole as opposed to pheromone release on behalf of a solitary male. Consequently, it is more desirable for the less attractive males to remain in the lek than to attempt to attract females on their own.[16]\nWithin reproductive aggregations of Pogonomyrmex barbatus ants, strong male competition exists. Male harvester ants engage in communal mating displays in order to attract females. Male ants will attempt to mate with any female they encounter, but females resist copulation from the males. Consequently, the communal mating displays heavily favor reproduction with larger or more persistent males who are able to overpower the females and successfully copulate. The male ants will copulate for as long as possible, likely to restrict access to the female from other males to ensure their sperm survives to reproduce.[17]\nRed harvester ants are a favorite food for desert horned lizards. Harvester ants will defend their colonies vigorously against real or perceived attacks, whether by large or small animals. They may bite ferociously and their stings are venomous and painful. The effect spreads through the lymphatic system, sometimes causing dangerous reactions, especially in animals sensitive or allergic to their venom.\nOver the years, their numbers have been declining, and this has often been attributed to competition for food with the invasive red imported fire ant and the Argentine ant. Their decline has affected many native species, especially those for which the red harvester ant is a chief source of food, such as the Texas horned lizard.\nRed harvester ants are commonly used in captive ant ecologies (the so-called, \"Ant Farm\", which is a trademark of Uncle Milton, Inc.). Their large size and foraging habits, coupled with an inability to climb the glass walls of the enclosures used, make the species an excellent choice for this role."], ["Red Harvester Ants - Department of Entomology - Texas ...", "https://insects.tamu.edu/extension/publications/epubs/e-402.cfm", "\u00a0\n\n\n\nBastiaan M. Drees*\n*Professor and Extension Entomologist, The Texas A&M University System.\nRed harvester ants are one of the more noticeable and larger ants in open areas in Texas. Eleven species in this group of ants (genus Pogonomyrmex) are known from the state. However, harvester ants are not nearly as common today as they were during the earlier 1900s. The decline, particularly in the eastern part of the state, has caused some alarm because these ants serve as a major source of food for the rapidly disappearing and threatened Texas horned lizard.\nWorker ants are 1\u20444 to 1\u20442 inch long and red to dark brown. They have squarish heads and no spines on the body. There are 22 species of harvester ants in the United States, 10 of which are found in Texas. Seven of these species are found only in far west Texas.\nWinged males and females swarm, couple and mate, especially following rains. Winged forms are larger than worker ants. Males soon die and females seek a suitable nesting site. After dropping her wings, the queen ant digs a burrow and produces a few eggs. Larvae hatch from eggs and develop through several stages (instars). Larvae are white and legless, shaped like a crookneck squash with a small distinct head. Pupation occurs within a cocoon. Worker ants produced by the queen ant begin caring for other developing ants, enlarge the nest and forage for food.\n Worker ants can give a painful, stinging bite, but are generally reluctant to attack. Effects of the bite can spread along lymph channels and can be medically serious. Harvester ant workers commonly are sold for ant farms.\n Worker ants remove vegetation in circular areas or craters around nests. Colonies occur in open areas and usually have a single central opening. The area around the opening usually has small pebbles deposited on the soil surface by the worker ants. Often there is no vegetation within a 3- to 6-foot circle around the central opening of the colony, and along foraging trails radiating from the colony. Colonies usually are widely separated; however, heavy infestations in pasture and rangeland can reduce yield. Red harvester ants also colonize in ornamental turf areas where their presence may be undesirable. They do not invade homes or structures.\nRed harvester ant foragers collect seeds and dead insects and store them in the nests as food for the colony. The ants\u2019 mouthparts are designed for chewing. \nRed harvester ants are native species and are generally not considered to be serious pests. Consider the option of not controlling these ants, especially in areas inhabited by the few remaining horned lizards (see box). \n\u00a0\nHowever, in certain cases, elimination of red harvester ants may be necessary. Destruction of their nests and habitat through regular discing and mowing may eliminate them without resorting to use of insecticides. If pesticides are selected, use registered products selectively and carefully follow instructions provided on the label. \nAlthough any insecticide registered to control \u201cants\u201d can be used to control harvester ants, few are registered specifically to control these species (Table 1). Harvester ants can be quickly eliminated using Amdro\u00ae Pro Fire Ant Bait (0.73 percent hydramethylnon) or similar products. Individual colonies can be treated using 2 to 5 tablespoons of product scattered around the colony\u2019s central opening. In larger areas, the product can be broadcast at a rate of 1 to 1 1\u20442 pounds product per acre (2 to 3 ounces per 5,000 square feet) using a suitable application device such as a hand-cranked seeder or the electric-driven mountable Herd GT Model 77 Seeder. Amdro\u00ae can be used in lawns, landscaped areas, golf courses, other noncropped areas, grounds surrounding poultry houses, corrals, other animal holding areas, nonbearing ornamental nursery stock, pasture and rangeland. Do not cut and bale hay from treated cattle pastures and rangeland until 7 days after bait application.\nTable 1.

Many of these harvester ant species are found in Texas, especially around the far western areas of Texas. Of all the harvester ant species in Texas, the Texas red harvester ant is the most noticeable \u2014 typically in open areas. Texas red harvester ants are the most common ants sold to hobbyists who maintain ant farms.\nWorkers of the Texas red harvester ant colonies have long bodies and range in color from red to dark brown.

Winged males and female swarmers are larger than worker ants.\nTexas red harvester ants feed primarily on seeds, including wild sunflowers, Johnson grass, burr clovers, alfalfa seeds and small beans. They also consume insects.\nTexas red harvester ants mate after rainy days. Males die soon after mating, while females shed their wings and begin new colonies by digging a burrow and laying eggs within it. These eggs eventually become worker ants, which care for other developing ants, build the nest and forage for food.\nThe sting of the Texas red harvester ant is painful and can cause severe allergic reactions in certain individuals.

This is a red colored ant that can be 6.5 to 10 mm long. Galleries have been found to go over 600 cm deep.\nThe three common species of harvester ants\u2014the red, western and California harvester ants\u2014each have unique behaviors, castes and tasks, feeding, nesting patterns and defense mechanisms. The harvester ant behavior differs between each species, seen through their feeding and nesting habits. In addition, unlike many other ants that infest indoor structures, all species of harvester ants prefer not to invade houses and buildings, but will establish their nests around gardens or yards, often destroying vegetation.\nThe red harvester ants can be aggressive. They deliver a painful sting. Sometimes, the stings of harvester ants can cause allergic reactions, especially to those sensitive to their venom. Aside from their powerful stings, harvester ants also bite viciously.\nThis is an important agricultural pest in many areas. The feeding habits of red harvester ants can be seen as they leave their nests and travel to their food sources, leaving a distinct scent throughout their paths.\nColonies usually contain a single queen who is responsible for producing the eggs. Winged reproductives, also called swarmer or alates, are produced in the summer. Males die soon after mating with the females, who go on to found new colonies.\nAside from the ants themselves, the large mounds, almost 53 inches across in some cases,\u00a0and denuded\u00a0vegetation\u00a0near to the nest are the most visible signs of harvester ant activity.\nThe answer to this question is YES, harvester ants are poisonous.  In general, the harvester ants in the genus Pogonomyrmex are aggressive biters that inject potent and painful venom with their stingers.   Like most stinging insects, their level of aggression and venom potency differs between species within the genus.  For example, the Florida harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex badius, is not considered an aggressive ant, but its venomous sting is very painful.\nWestern Harvester Ants\nBlack Harvester Ants\nTexas Red Harvester Ants\nRed Harvester Ant Mating Swarms\n\n\t\tGive us a call:\n        \n844-514-3980\n\n\nOr schedule a call with an Orkin Specialist today and get a FREE estimate for:\n\n\t\tThis branch appears close by:\n\t\t\n\n,  \n\n\nNot in ?\n\t\tEnter a zip code below to view local branches.\nLearn to identify this pest with these helpful pictures.\n\u00a0\nSee more photos here \n\u00a0"], ["Management of the Red Harvester Ant Pogonomyrmex ...", "https://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/huntwild/wild/wildlife_diversity/texas_nature_trackers/horned_lizard/documents/harvester_ant_management.pdf", ""], ["An Ant You Can Love: the Red Harvester Ant - Texas ...", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1NSQspizo", "\n\n\nLoading...\n    \n\n\n\n\nLoading...\n    \n\n\n\n\nLoading...\n    \n\n\n\n\nLoading...\n    \n\n\n\n\nLoading...\n    \n\n\n\n\nLoading...\n    \n\n\nPublished on Jun 29, 2012\n\nUnlike non-native fire ants, red harvester ants (Pogonomyrmex barbatus) provide many benefits to Texas habitat and wildlife, including serving as the main food item for the Texas Horned Lizard.

in The World of the Harvester Ants.\u00a0 \nIn a large body of work by modern scientists \u0096 very bright people who try to understand our world \u0096 harvester ants have become something of a legend because they raise baffling questions that almost seem to extend into the realm of mysticism.\u00a0\nSocietal Riddles\nIn a way that mystifies the human mind, which has the inclination to institute leadership, delegate responsibilities, organize resources and set schedules to carry out tasks, a colony of harvester ants (like colonies of other ant species) operates perfectly well in the absence of any apparent central control or organizing force, according to Deborah Gordon, Ants at Work.\u00a0 A queen mother, who serves as a well-maintained egg-laying machine rather than a royal sovereign, founds a colony of harvester ants, which may grow to 10,000 to 20,000 individuals.\u00a0 With no evident guiding hand, worker ants \u0096 all female children of the queen \u0096 go about the complex business of tending their mother, protecting her eggs, nurturing their baby sisters, pampering reproductive sisters and brothers, excavating and maintaining labyrinthine chambers, harvesting and storing food seeds, grooming themselves and defending their colony.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nIn another unexplained phenomenon, all neighboring harvester ant colonies of the same species \u0096 with no obvious prior communications, coordination or cue among them \u0096 emerge from their burrows on a single climactic spring or summer day each year to send swarms of young winged would-be queens with their winged male consorts swarming into the desert air, on missions to breed and establish new homes.\u00a0 In some puzzling way, all the colonies know the appointed moment.\u00a0 While most, including all the males, soon die because of exposure to the desert environment, starvation outside the nurturing colony, or predation by various gluttonous ant lovers, a few lucky females, probably less than one percent, will manage to find new homes and establish new colonies, beginning with tiny burrows they excavate into the soil.\u00a0 The new queen carries within her the sperm from several different males.\nThe Ant\nHopefully, a harvester ant, which may belong to any of several black to reddish-brown harvester ant species in the Southwest, will not introduce itself to you with its extraordinarily painful sting.\u00a0 It can induce, especially among sensitive victims, a long list of discomforts, including, for example, extended pain, burning, hives, swelling, wheezing, sweating, faintness, nausea and piloerection (hair standing on end), according to Taber.\u00a0\nThe sting may make you mad, too.\u00a0\nClosely related to the wasp and the bee, according to Floyd Werner and Carl Olson, Insects of the Southwest, the typical harvester ant measures about three-eighths of an inch in length.\u00a0 It has \u201ca basket of long setae on the underside of the head\u201d that it uses to carry soil when excavating and cleaning its nest.\u00a0\nA colony signals its presence by clearing all vegetation surrounding the entrance to its nest, leaving a barren flat or mounded area \u0096 a midden \u0096 several feet in diameter.\u00a0 Earning the name \u201charvester ants,\u201d foragers collect seeds, especially from desert grasses, which they stash in underground storerooms.\u00a0 They may also prey on insects, especially termites, if they can find and catch them.\u00a0 They forego water altogether, depending on humidity within their nest for moisture.\u00a0\nThe Colony\nA colony begins fortuitously when one of the few winged and fully-mated females, or queens, to survive an annual flight manages to establish a small burrow, most likely in an open area.\u00a0 \u201cThe first thing [any new queen ant] does,\u201d said William Atherton DuPuy in Our Insect Friends and Foes, \u201cis to tear off her wings, which she never expects to use again now that she had made her marriage flight.\u201d\u00a0 After digging the burrow several inches in depth, she lays several eggs, her very first, which \u201cbecome tiny, wormlike larvae, and finally turn into pupae, resembling ants enclosed in a papery case,\u201d said Gordon.\u00a0 \u201cWhen an ant emerges from the pupal case [after several weeks] it is an adult and does not grow any more.\u201d\u00a0 The queen, who will now spend the rest of her life in total darkness, nurtures her first young, all female ants, very carefully, from her own fat reserves.\u00a0 She may even lick them like a mother cat licks her kittens.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nWith an apparent inborn understanding of their respective roles, these ants \u0096 much smaller, for some reason, than their successors will be \u0096 set up housekeeping.\u00a0 They forage for seeds.\u00a0 They care for the next generation, working to make the fledgling colony viable before closing down for the coming fall and winter.\u00a0\nWith the arrival of spring, when the ant community reawakens, the population divides into two groups, according to Gordon.\u00a0 About three quarters of the ants \u0096 all females \u0096 will operate primarily in the depths of the nest.\u00a0 Some of these ants care for the queen, the sole, vital source of eggs for the colony.\u00a0 Some nurture new larvae.\u00a0 Others excavate new chambers to accommodate their growing numbers.\u00a0 Others store food in designated spaces.\u00a0 Still others maintain the nest, carrying ant trash and excavated dirt to the surface.\u00a0 Some, apparently, just hang around in case they might be needed.\u00a0 The remaining quarter of the population \u0096 again, all females \u0096 stays near the surface of the nest.\u00a0 Again, by some unknown understanding, maintenance workers tidy up immediately around the entrance.\u00a0 Patrolling ants inspect the nest midden area, stop and interrogate intruding ants, and set the day\u2019s foraging courses.\u00a0 The foraging ants typically travel perhaps as much as 30 to 40 feet from the nest in their quest for food, collecting the seeds from perhaps dozens of nearby plant species.\u00a0 Meanwhile, still other maintenance workers police the midden surrounding the nest entrance.\u00a0 It appears, says Gordon, that the younger ants perform the subsurface chores, the senior ants, the surface duties.\u00a0 As ants age, they graduate from subsurface to surface duties.\nAfter about five years, when the colony typically reaches a population of about 10,000, said Gordon, the queen produces the first breeding offspring\u0097the winged would-be queens and their winged male consorts.\u00a0 In a celebration of renewal, the colony may cast its winged emissaries \u0096 called \u201calates\u201d \u0096 to the winds once every year for the nest 10 to 15 years, until the queen dies, signaling the eventual end of the colony since she is the sole producer of its eggs.\u00a0\nNest Architecture\nAs the colony grows and matures, subterranean workers expand the nest, creating an interlocking system of tunnels and galleries, according to Taber, although sometimes, \u201c\u2026part of the nest occupies a dome of earth and gravel that the ants themselves build up from excavated materials and from surface scrapings nearby.\u00a0 These mounds are the hallmark of the western harvester\u2026\u201d\nThe workers may excavate several feet in depth, to the caliche hardpan of the desert, producing a maze of tunnels a half inch in diameter and chambers several inches in breadth.\u00a0 The colony uses the chambers for the queen\u2019s housing, the nurseries, seed storage and garbage disposal.\u00a0 When workers have to repair tunnels and chambers, they transfer larvae and seeds to other, stable quarters.\u00a0 The workers may litter the mound at the entrance with the detritus of the soil, including such things as small pebbles, plant matter and, said Taber, even broken glass and nails.\u00a0 (During surveys of archaeological sites for various institutions, we have sometimes found prehistoric beads and other small artifacts on the mounds of harvester ants.)\nThe workers build a mound surrounded by a cleared surface for uncertain reasons, according to Taber, but they might construct the feature to \u0096 for example \u0096 minimize flooding of the entrance, provide a barrier to wildfires or to discourage intrusion of plant roots.\u00a0 They might even use it as a defense mechanism, denying cover to potential predators.\u00a0\nImportantly, ants \u201care the primary soil workers in the Southwest\u2026\u201d said Werner and Olson.\u00a0 \u201cTheir nest-making\u2026aerates the soil, helps retain soil moisture or drainage, and fertilizes and distributes many native plants.\u201d\nDefense of the Colony\nAlthough armed with a painful sting, the harvester ant nevertheless faces a host of unintimidated, fearsome enemies, some of them so threatening that the colony has to engage them in full-scale combat.\u00a0\nWhile the ant suffers predation by birds, amphibians, reptiles, insects, spiders and other organisms, it must see the horned lizard, the so-called \u201chorny toad,\u201d as a dragon.\u00a0 The colony that faces a horned lizard feeding on the ants near the entrance to the nest may mount a swarming attack against the menacing ogre.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cA [horned] lizard besieged but determined to stay will remain motionless as dozens of ants crawl over its scaly armor, biting and stinging as they go,\u201d said Taber.\u00a0 Unfortunately for the ants, the horned lizards have \u201can immunity or defense against ant venom in the form of a detoxifying substance in their blood plasma\u2026, and when mobbed they simply hunker down with closed eyes until the ants leave.\u201d\u00a0 The horned lizards then simply resume feeding.\u00a0 The ant colony may suffer considerable losses to a persistent lizard.\u00a0 (When I was a youngster, I once caught a horny toad and placed it at the entrance of a busy harvester ant colony in the Rolling Plains of Texas, just to see what would happen.\u00a0 The grateful creature lapped up ant after ant, presumably to the distress of the colony.)\nA harvester ant colony may also have to defend itself against competing and raiding ants of other species or even of its own species.\u00a0 (I remember seeing a colony of harvester ants at war with a force of invading ants once in the Texas Rolling Plains.\u00a0 It looked like a seething mass of enraged miniature armies in conflict.)\n \u201cWhen harvester ants fight,\u201d said Gordon, \u201cthey grab onto each other with their mandibles and hold on.\u00a0 Often each ant clamps the other\u2019s petiole, the segment that attaches the abdomen to the thorax\u2026\u00a0 Sometimes one ant succeeds in breaking the other into two pieces.\u00a0 Sometimes an ant dies while clamped on to another, but the mandibular muscles of a dead ant maintain their grip though the rest of the ant may break off.\u00a0 \u2026it is not unusual to see an ant walking around with just the head of its attacker still attached to its petiole.\u201d\nAnt Studies\n\u00a0Because of parallels with the human community, ant colonies have for centuries drawn the attention of human observers, especially the biologists, who have studied such aspects as the insects\u2019 life history, social structure, organization, individual behavior, family relationships, navigational abilities, slaving practices, memory, communications, adaptability, genetics and environmental impacts.\u00a0 Ants, according to the FOXNews.com Internet site, have even suffered the indignity of having their legs lengthened by stilts or shorted by partial amputation by researchers who wanted to see whether lengthened or shortened strides would alter the insects\u2019 calculations of distance.\u00a0\nSo far, the collective studies have shown, as a Stanford University News Release in the Stanford News Service Internet site said, \u201cAn individual ant is not very bright, but ants in a colony, operating as a collective, do remarkable things.\u201d\u00a0\nThat may have been what prompted a very wise fellow named Solomon to say in his book of Proverbs:\nGo to the ant, O sluggard;\n        consider her ways, and be wise.\n        Without having any chief,\n        officer or ruler,\n        she prepares her food in summer \n        and gathers her sustenance in\u00a0harvest.\n        How long will you lie there, O\n        sluggard?\nBy Jay W.

Where it does occur, the ant nest is\r\n  readily visible as a large cleared area with a number of slow moving individuals on the surface\r\n  near the nest. Harvester ants in the genus Pogonomyrmex received this name due to their\r\n  practice of gathering seeds for food. While there are 22 species of harvester ants found in the\r\n  United States, only the Florida harvester ant occurs east of the Mississippi River (Smith and\r\n  Whitman 1992). \n\nFigure 1. Major worker of the Florida harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex  badius (Latreille). Photograph by Lyle J. Buss, University of  Florida.\n  The Florida harvester ant is found from Florida to North Carolina (Haack and Granovsky\r\n  1990) and west into Mississippi (Creighton 1950) and Louisiana (Cole 1968).  The ant is the\r\n  only eastern representative of the genus Pogonomyrmex (Cole 1968).\r\n\n  The adults are dark rust red in color (Haack and Granovsky 1990), with the worker caste\r\n  strongly polymorphic (1/4 to 3/8 inch long) (Smith and Whitman 1992). The major worker has\r\n  a disproportionally enlarged head (after Creighton 1950).\r\n\nLike most other Pogonomyrmex spp. the Florida harvester ant has a psammophore (rows of\r\n  long hair on ventral side of head) but it is poorly developed (Smith and Whitman 1992).  \r\n  The antennae are clubless with twelve segments. The thoracic dorsum has the sutures\r\n  obsolescent or absent,  and the thorax is not impressed between the masonotum and epinotum; \r\n  The abdominal pedicel consists of two segments.  The tibial spurs on the middle and hind legs\r\n  are very finely pectinate. \n \nFigure 2. Harvester ant worker, Pogonomyrmex badius (Latreille). Drawing by Division of Plant Industry. \n  The Florida harvester ant differs from all other Pogonomyrmex spp. in having polymorphic\r\n  (more than one size)  workers. The huge headed soldiers (major workers) are not abundant in\r\n  the colonies and seem to be no more aggressive or pugnacious than the intermediate and\r\n  smaller workers (Wheeler 1910).\r\n\nThe Florida harvester ant nests exclusively or by preference in sand.  It requires open areas in\r\n  which to build its nest and tends to nest in open woodlands or grassy areas (Haack and\r\n  Granovsky 1990).  Xeric hammocks are preferred.  Many nests are found on lawns, around\r\n  gardens, and in fire lanes (Van Pelt 1958).  The mound is very slight and flattened with single\r\n  or multiple entrances in the center and is from 30 to 60 cm in diameter.  Unlike most other\r\n  harvester ant species (Haack and Granovsky 1990), Florida harvester ant workers make no\r\n  effort to clear vegetation from around the mound (Wheeler 1910). However, the mound is\r\n  often covered with small pebbles or charcoal from burned areas (Smith and Whitman 1992). \n\nFigure 3. Colony entrance of the Florida harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex badius (Latreille). Photograph by Lyle J. Buss,  University of Florida.\nThe ant is vigorously active in rather low relative humidity (below 55 percent) and in high\r\n  temperatures (35-40\u00b0C). Mating swarms usually occur in the afternoon after a rain (Haack and\r\n  Granovsky 1990). Winged forms (reproductive adults) have been observed in the nests in\r\n  May, and mating flights were recorded for June (Van Pelt 1958).  Haack and Granovsky\r\n  (1990) state that harvester ants swarm from June to October although the swarms are more\r\n  common during August and September. Colonies are long lived and one was observed to last\r\n  at least 19 years (Haack and Granovsky 1990). There is a single queen in each colony (Smith\r\n  and Whitman 1992). \nThe ant harvests the seeds of many plants and stores them in the flat graneries of its nest which\r\n  consists of many subterranean tunnels and chambers (Haack and Granovsky 1990, Tschinkel\r\n  2001).  It not only collects seeds that have fallen to the ground, but also plucks them directly\r\n  from the plants, husks them and deposits the chaff on the kitchen middens at the periphery of\r\n  the mound.  Seeds from the following plants have been identified from nests: ragweed, crab grass, small crab grass, rough buttonweed, sedge, Paspalium sp., poke weed, red clover, alfalfa, evening primrose, narrow leaf vetch and crotonweed. \n\nFigure 4. Foraging Florida harvester ants, Pogonomyrmex  badius (Latreille). Photograph by Lyle J. Buss, University of  Florida. \nThe Florida harvester ant moves its nest periodically (an average of once every 234 days) in\r\n  response to changes in microclimate resulting from shading due to overhanging vegetation. Pogonomyrmex workers of one colony will readily fight members of another colony of the same or different ant\r\n  species and continued strife of this kind also results in colony movement (Smith and Whitman\r\n  1992). \n  The Florida harvester ant is not of economic importance to growers and homeowners, is not\r\n  aggressive and almost has to be forced to sting someone. However, the sting is among the\r\n  more painful of those received from ants and the pain lasts longer than usual for ant stings due\r\n  to the poison injected (Haack and Granovsky 1990). Some swelling may also occur as the\r\n  reaction to their stings spread along the lymph channels (Ebeling 1978).\r\n\nA personal account of a sting episode by Wray (1938) is as follows:  \"Several ants stung me\r\n  on the wrist, and after a few minutes an intense fiery pain began in this area which was about\r\n  two inches in diameter.  It turned deep red in color and immediately a watery, sticky secretion\r\n  came out of the skin.  This area became hot and feverish and the excruciating pain lasted all\r\n  day and up into the night.\" At least one death, a child in Oklahoma, has been credited to stings\r\n  by the red harvester ant, P. barbatus (Haack and Granovsky 1990). \n  Generally, management of the Florida harvester ant isn't necessary unless the ant is located\r\n  where small children may be playing or in other similar circumstances.  An adult may easily\r\n  avoid the ant, thus avoiding the extremely painful sting. The Florida harvester ant uses odor\r\n  trials as well as sun orientation to return to food sources (Ebeling 1978) so placing baits on\r\n  these trails may help control a colony. Mounds should be treated during the hottest part of the\r\n  day, as the ants are least active at this time, by injecting a labeled insecticidal dust into the\r\n  entrance (Smith and Whitman 1992).  Insect growth regulators are also recommended, but\r\n  take longer to destroy the colony.\r\n\nIn the event that management is necessary, see the following University of Florida\r\n  recommendations: \nInsect Management Guide for ants \nAnt Trails: a Key to Management with Baits "], ["Pogonomyrmex barbatus - Ants of the Southwestern United ...", "http://www.tightloop.com/ants/showspecies.php?species_id=22", ""], ["Draft genome of the red harvester ant Pogonomyrmex ...", "http://www.pnas.org/content/108/14/5667.abstract", "\nSearch\n\n\n\n                              \t\t\t\t\t\t\tGO\n\n\n\nSkip to main page content\n\nEdited* by Gene E. Robinson, University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign, Urbana, IL, and approved November 9, 2010 (received for\n                                    review June 5, 2010)\n                                 \nWe report the draft genome sequence of the red harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex barbatus. The genome was sequenced using 454 pyrosequencing, and the current assembly and annotation were completed in less than 1\n                              y. Analyses of conserved gene groups (more than 1,200 manually annotated genes to date) suggest a high-quality assembly and\n                              annotation comparable to recently sequenced insect genomes using Sanger sequencing. The red harvester ant is a model for studying\n                              reproductive division of labor, phenotypic plasticity, and sociogenomics.

The genome was sequenced using 454 pyrosequencing, and the current assembly and annotation were completed in less than 1 y. Analyses of conserved gene groups (more than 1,200 manually annotated genes to date) suggest a high-quality assembly and annotation comparable to recently sequenced insect genomes using Sanger sequencing. The red harvester ant is a model for studying reproductive division of labor, phenotypic plasticity, and sociogenomics. Although the genome of P. barbatus is similar to other sequenced hymenopterans (Apis mellifera and Nasonia vitripennis) in GC content and compositional organization, and possesses a complete CpG methylation toolkit, its predicted genomic CpG content differs markedly from the other hymenopterans. Gene networks involved in generating key differences between the queen and worker castes (e.g., wings and ovaries) show signatures of increased methylation and suggest that ants and bees may have independently co-opted the same gene regulatory mechanisms for reproductive division of labor.

(Photo by Cathryn Hoyt)\nYou\u2019ve seen their sprawling, barren mounds, like little moonscapes in your field or lawn. You\u2019ve probably seen them lugging seeds back to their home. You may have even felt the burn of their sting. We know them as harvester ants\u2014so named because they harvest seeds. But what do they do with these seeds? And why do they build their conspicuous mounds?\n\nOf the 26 harvester ant species in the United States, at least 10 call Texas home. Their trademark is a three- to six-foot-wide clearing around the entrance to their underground nests.\nBefore they even begin building a nest, harvester ants clear plants away from the area. Why they do this isn\u2019t fully understood, but many reasons have been suggested. The bare area around the nest entrance ensures that the mound gets ample direct sunlight. This helps maintain relatively stable temperatures within the nest\u2019s tunnels and chambers, which in turn may help incubate eggs. By clearing such a large area, the ants may prevent plants from taking root that would shade their mound. The clearings may also help harvester ants spot predators more easily.\nCuriously, harvester ants don\u2019t leave these clearings totally clear. They cover them with pebbles, charcoal, and sometimes dead vegetation, among other things. Some researchers think this waterproofs their nest or acts as insulation.\nUnder a mound, nests can be more than 15-feet deep and house upwards of 12,000 ants. Inside these elaborate nests are numerous chambers\u2014called granaries\u2014where ants tend their nurseries, stash waste and store their harvest.\nEnergy-rich native grass seeds are a staple of harvester ant diets, though they also feed on arthropods and even animal feces. Female worker ants forage during the day, from spring until fall, after which the ants usually go dormant for the winter. As they search for food, worker ants create trails, which they follow as far as 40 feet from the mound, though some species have been reported to travel up to 160 feet. \nThe most familiar predators of harvester ants are Texas horned lizards, who specialize in eating them. Other predators include birds, toads, spiders, and insects, including other harvester ants.\nTo fend off predators, harvester ants have evolved incredibly painful stings. Their venom is among the world\u2019s most toxic insect venoms; a single sting contains enough toxin to kill several mice. Only female harvester ants sting though, and usually only when provoked.\nBecause of their powerful sting, some people regard harvester ants as a nuisance. But they\u2019re a natural ally in our fight against another insect nuisance\u2014red imported fire ants. The Comanche Harvester, for example, can be found hunting for fire ant queens. Once the fire ant queen mates and loses her wings, she drops to the ground, becoming prey for vigilant harvester ant workers.\nAt the same time, imported fire ants can decimate harvester ant populations. This has been linked to the decline of Texas horned lizards in some places. The fire ants both outcompete and prey on harvester ants, the lizards\u2019 primary food source. Young lizards are also sometimes killed by fire ants.\nDespite harvester ants\u2019 ecological importance, some landowners resort to poisoning their mounds, or inadvertently poison them when they\u2019re battling fire ants. If you use pesticides on fire ants, but want to protect harvester ants, spot treatment, rather than broadcast application, is recommended.\nAll in all, harvester ants are an object of curiosity for observant naturalists. Whether you love or hate them, do so with a healthy dose of respect.\nAnne Marie Hilscher is a lecturer and research technician at Sul Ross State University in Alpine, Texas.\nHave a question or comment about this episode?

If you have reddish-looking ants going into an out of a mound of soil on your land, then chances are that you have either fire ants or harvester ants. (Harvester ants actually are more common than fire ants here in the Verde Valley.)\nBoth fire ants and harvester ants are capable of inflicting painful stings. In fact, the stings are the reason  why fire ants are called fire ants. Fire ant stings burn like fire. In fact, they feel like someone built a fire under your skin, and it's burning its way to the surface.\n Harvester ant stings aren't a lot of fun, either. In fact, on the Schmidt Pain Index (yes, there is such a thing), harvester ant stings rank even worse than fire ant stings. The entomologist who invented the Index, Justin O Schmidt, describes harvester ant stings as \"Bold and unrelenting. Somebody is using a drill to excavate your ingrown toenail.\" Harvester ant venom is also the most toxic in the insect world.\nAs if that weren't bad enough, it's pretty unusual to be stung by only one fire ant or harvester ant. Fire ants don't sting just for the fun of it. When they sting, they do so in self-defense. They feel that their nests are being threatened. So they come out in full force, with hundreds or thousands of ants attacking the perceived threat, with a singleness of purpose that would make a military commander proud. Fire ant and harvester ant extermination are definitely not do-it-yourself jobs.\nFire ants and harvester ants both build nests in the soil, they both have painful stings, they both will attack as a group, and they both damage lawns and turf. More importantly to most folks, neither fire ants nor harvester ants are something you want to have in your back yard, golf course, schoolyard, campsite, or athletic field.\nBeyond those similarities, fire ants and harvester ants really aren't very closely related, aside from both species being ants. They don't share a known common ancestor, they're not all that morphologically similar (except for being red in color), and they have different habits. \nHarvester ants are bigger than fire ants at about a quarter of an inch, and all adult worker harvester ants are about that size. Adult fire ant workers can be as small as one-sixteenth of an inch, and the biggest fire ant workers are slightly less than a quarter inch in length.\nFire ants and harvester ants also eat different foods. Fire ants  are omnivorous, feeding on plant materials, insects and other arthropods, carrion, and occasionally small mammals. Harvester ants mainly eat seeds, which they carry to and store in their nests (which is why they're called harvester ants).\nFire ants and harvester ants also build different kinds of nests, with the most noticeable differences being that harvester ant nests tend to be flatter, are devoid of living vegetation, tend to have empty seed shells strewn about, and usually have a single entrance hole. Fire ant nests are more dome-shaped, can become quite large,  and have no visible entry or exist holes.\nBoth fire ants and harvester ants can be tricky (and dangerous) to control. They're definitely not do-it-yourself kinds of jobs. Proper identification, knowledge of their life cycles and biology, and specialized products and equipment are necessary for extermination of these aggressive ant species. We may use baits, granular products, or liquid insecticides to kill fire ants or harvester ants, depending on the size and maturity of the nest, the season, the weather (seriously), and many other factors.\nFor more information about High Desert Pest's fire ant and harvester ant extermination services, please contact us for a professional inspection, consultation, and treatment plan.\n\u00a0\nWe provide fire ant and harvester ant control in Arizona's Verde Valley, including Cottonwood, Sedona, Clarkdale, Village of Oak Creek, Camp Verde, Rimrock, and Cornville.\n\nCopyright 2005, 2013 High Desert Pest Control.

Of these two species the red harvester ant is the most well known species and will be the species discussed in this article.\nThe red harvester ant is most recognized by myrmecologists, or ant lovers, as the ant most recommended to live in ant farms; however, red harvester ants can also be found in the wild as well. Red harvester ants are known for the red orange color, hence the name \u201cred harvester ant\u201d and are predominantly found in the south west United States. Red harvester ants are easily recognized as being a much larger ant species than other commonly seen ants, measuring between \u00bc to \u00bd an inch long as worker ants and their habitats are particularly recognizable as well.\nRed harvester ants make their homes in open areas and remove all vegetation from that area in a circular pattern so they are relatively easy to spot. Worker ants within the colony may deposit small rocks close to the entrance of the colony which can be as small as one foot in diameter or as wide as four feet and can be anywhere from two to ten inches high. Oftentimes red harvester ants will remove vegetation in an extremely large circle that radiates as far as thirty five feet away from the colony mound. The reason for cleaning their territory is generally unknown although some entomologists believe that it could be to help regulate temperatures within and around the mound while others believe that it has more to do with making it easier to spot intruders and predators around the colony. The worker ants are believed to deposit small rocks or dead leaves around the top of the mound as well in an effort to keep the colony warm.\nThe red harvester feed predominantly on seeds which they locate locally to their mound. While the red harvester ants will feed on a variety of seeds as well as grasses and even dead insects they tend to prefer to keep their diet homogenous until no more of that food is available to the colony when they will begin to eat a different food staple. The ants in the colony obtain food by traveling out from the nest as far as 31 miles in search of seeds and other food supplies. Looking at the top of a red harvester ant mound will sometimes reveal trails leading out from the colony. Trails can be as few as three or as many as eight and are used by the ants to go out to seek food and bring that food back to the colony.\nWithin the red harvester ant colony there are a variety of different ants whose duties within the colony change depending on their position. The scout ants are assigned the job of scouting for food which means that they are responsible for exiting the mound each morning and following the trails that emanate from the mound in search of food. As they progress along trails the scout ants leave scent markers so that the worker ants that follow will be able to track them and collect any food that has been recovered. Ants will follow the existing trails that emanate from the mound until they end, if no food is found on the existing trail then the ants will continue out from the existing trails in varying directions with one ant per direction. These scout ants that forge new pathways are looking for new supplies of food to mark for the worker ants to bring back to the colony. Food is brought back to the colony where it is hoarded in stores.\nWhile, within the colony, the scout ants are out looking for new food sources and the worker ants are busy fetching these new food sources back to the colony, the remaining ants, the \u201cmiddens\u201d tend and care for the colony and the mound. The middens are all female ants as are the workers. The middens clean the colony by removing dead ants and taking them to an area of the colony that humans would recognize as a trash pile. Within a trash pile are dead ants as well as various other items that the ants consider trash and wish to remove from the active colony. It is through this assignment of roles within the colony that the ants maintain such an ordered hierarchy in their society. With each ant having a specific duty there is no question as to where each ant should be during the daily routine.\nThe hierarchy of the red harvester ant colony begins, like many other insect hierarchies, with the queen. The queen is a winged alate (an ant capable of mating) that has been fertilized by a male alate. The males generally die after mating and the queens leave to begin their own colony. The queen red harvester ant is the source of the worker ants within her colony and throughout her lifetime she will continue to produce worker ants. A queen red harvester ant can live anywhere from one year up until approximately twenty years, all the while producing worker ants to populate her colony.\nAlthough red harvester ants are utilized in many ant farm businesses the ants that are shipped to individuals wishing to begin their own ant colony are only worker ants and therefore the colony will eventually die out. It is illegal within the United States to ship a queen red harvester ant because were she to escape and begin a colony in an area that is not native to the red harvester ant it could become quite a problem for the area where she settles and raises her colony. While ant farms can survive for months at a time without a queen they will not survive indefinitely due to the lack of reproduction within the all female colony of worker ants.\nIn the wild red harvester ant populations seem to be on the decline. Many biologists believe that the red harvester ants are being pushed out of their territory by imported red fire ants and argentine ants. These two varieties of ant are not native to the areas where the red harvest ant lives; however, they are particularly invasive and are providing a lot of competition for the red harvester ants when it comes to feeding. With more competition for their food supplies the population of red harvester ants is dwindling.\nIt is not only other species of ants that are affecting the populations of red harvester ants either, these insects, although not a particularly pleasant encounter for humans, make the perfect meal for horned lizards that have a particularly tough and scaly skin which is impermeable by the fire ant\u2019s sting or bite. These horned lizards feed almost exclusively on red harvest ants and in areas where the horned lizards have become a protected species the red harvest ant population is lower. That said, however, these two species are dependent upon each other and in areas where the red harvest ants have been eliminated by competing ant species the horned lizards are also endangered because of the lack of red harvest ants for them to feed upon.\nWhile the horned lizards have a particularly tough exterior that can hold up to the sting and bite of a red harvest ant, humans and many other creatures that inadvertently wander in the direction of the colony, are not so well protected. When the red harvest ant\u2019s colony is disturbed ants will come out of the mound in full force ready to attack whatever disturbed the mound whether it is a human or an animal they don\u2019t discriminate. The red harvest ant will defend its colony by \u201cbiting\u201d with their mandibles as well as stinging them with their stingers which are located on their abdomens.\nRed harvest ants are particularly aggressive in defending their colony and their sting is particularly painful and can sometimes cause allergic reactions in both animals and humans that are prone to allergies to other insects. Once they begin biting and stinging it can be rather difficult to shake off a red harvest ant colony but it is advisable to shake off the ants and move away from the colony\u2019s mound as quickly as possible. While the bite and sting of a red harvester ant can be particularly painful and even life threatening to those with allergies, red harvester ants will generally not bite or sting unless they are forced to do so in defense of their colony. It is not advised that you handle red harvester ants, however, because the slightest inkling of threat will cause these insects to treat you as an intruder to the colony.\nLike many other species of ants the red harvester ant does not take likely to any intruder to their colony, whether this intruder is the foot of a human or another ant. Even if an intruding ant is another red harvester ant it will not be accepted in to the mound by the colony. Ants that hail from one colony carry a distinct scent that is unique to their colony and ants that come from a different colony carry a different scent. Upon moving in to another ant\u2019s colony the individual intruder will be attacked just as any other creature stepping in to the red harvester ant mound would be attacked. Red harvester ants, however, are not believed to be cannibalistic even though they do feed on other dead insect carcasses it is believed that at least within their own colony dead red harvester ants will be taken to the \u201ctrash pile.\u201d What is ultimately done with invading red harvester ants from other colonies is unknown as they would surely not make it out of the foreign red harvester ant colony alive.\nRed harvester ants are generally not a nuisance to humans as they do not enter the home or seek shelter indoors. These large ants are strictly outdoor insects that feed and thrive outdoors (or at least within the safety of a secluded ant farm) and are not happy to live indoors. There are occasions when the red harvester ant impinges on humans though, generally this is when a colony of red harvester ants builds their home on someone lawn or on a golf course as not only are the mounds displeasing to the eye but these areas are frequently walked upon and consequently many people are at risk for being bitten or stung. It is generally a good idea to call in pest control professionals to eliminate unwanted colonies of red harvester ants in order to reduce the likelihood of being injured during elimination. Red harvester ants are most efficiently eliminated through the use of fire ant bait; however, this bait is poisonous and should be used with care.\nThe red harvester ant colony is something of a machine and while they often make themselves unwanted by virtue of their mound placement they are creatures that prove the true miracle that is nature. Each individual red harvester ant may not amount to much but within a colony where each ant has its own specific job and knows nothing about the entire machine within which it works, the individuals come together to work as one well oiled machine. With a duty for each ant and a hard working ant for each duty the red harvester ant colonies are a clear example of what it means to live as one. With just one group of their colony removed a mound of ants would be unable to function and perform the duties necessary to its survival but through an elegantly adapted means of communication the entire ant colony is able to work together and create a safe and secure life for every member of the colony. They may not appear to be much on the outside but in the grand scheme of things these little insects are a sign of what truly miraculous creatures walk the planet Earth.\nPerhaps one of the most amazing things is how the entire colony has the ability to mobilize against a common threat.\u00a0 In order to do this, they have to use some kind of chemical scent, a pheromone emitted by the ants themselves.\u00a0 It seems like an effective method whatever it is.\u00a0 I have personally been attacked by red harvester ants and it is no pleasant experience.\u00a0 At first, I did not even know I was being attacked.\u00a0 Then I felt a slight pinch or sting on my foot (I was barefoot at the time, stupid I know) and mostly disregarded it as an itch.\u00a0 Then another one happened, and another one, and then the next thing I know I have about a dozen red harvester ants all going at my foot simultaneously.\u00a0 It was an extremely painful experience to say the least.\nMy foot actually started to swell and I had a little bit of blood drawn by the ants themselves.\u00a0 I did not think they were capable of doing that, but I guess I learned the hard way.\u00a0 At any rate, it is not hard to imagine how they would be able to take down a smaller animal.\u00a0\nThat makes what the horned lizard is capable of doing amazing in its own right.\u00a0 The lizards are so well adapted to their environment, that they have armored themselves to be able to live through even the most severe red harvester attacks.\u00a0\nWe must be diligent in protecting the environments of both of these animals.\u00a0 As humans keep multiplying and expanding in the limited space we have on earth, we continue to encroach more and more on these amazing creatures.\u00a0 Red harvester ants clearly need a great deal of space, and undisturbed dirt no less, to exist and the horned lizards that feed on them need to be preserved as well.\u00a0\nWe could probably learn a great deal from studying the red harvester ant and their colonies.\u00a0 They are masters of utilizing natural resources and maintaining an orderly society that works together to live, thrive, and survive.\u00a0 I find it incredible that there is still so much we do not know about them and how they live the way that they do.\u00a0\nI have never had an ant colony before, but for the first time in my life I think I may want to find one.\u00a0 Who knows, maybe I could even find a queen and start my own colony!\u00a0 Well, that is probably not such a good idea.\u00a0 My apartment is messy enough already.\nAnts are so hardworking and so cool.\u00a0 Red harvester ants, and just ants in general, are really amazing creatures.\u00a0 It is a shame that there is a problem with their decline in population as they really are a miraculous creature and societal animal to observe.\u00a0 This article did a really good job of putting that into context.\n\tThe thing I think I find the most amazing about the red harvester ant colony is the fact that literally thousands and thousands of ants all come from the same queen.\u00a0 Furthermore, that queen can live up to twenty years, meaning it is more likely that tens of thousands of ants all came from her eggs.\u00a0 It makes me wonder how nature came up with their genetic design.\nClearly the colony shares a bond that goes beyond anything we can comprehend.\u00a0 This has to be because there is the common genetic strain running through each and every ant that they share with their queen.\u00a0\u00a0 But there is still enough genetic diversity coming through the males who fertilize the eggs (and then die) to allow for diversity within the colony.\u00a0 Considering all the variations of ants and the different purposes they serve, it really is a beautiful design.\u00a0\n\tIt is almost like the colony is not a group of organisms living together, but one giant organism that more so has the different types of ants constituting the different organs of a single organism.\u00a0 Similar to a crab and its shell, the ant colony burrows into the earth and uses it to protect the vital organism components.\u00a0 I wonder what the largest colony on record is, it must have been a formidable sight to see for any approaching predators, with all the foliage taken down in a wide radius around it.\u00a0\nIn thinking about how the colony works, the scout ants seem to be one of the most vital components of the colony as a whole.\u00a0 It is their job to venture out away from the safety of the hive to risk their own lives to find a reliable food source.\u00a0 Once they find it, it is not even their responsibility to get that food back, they have to continue to keep looking for the ever-elusive next meal.\u00a0\nAnother amazing thing about the ants is their ability to communicate.\u00a0 As far as we know, ants have no kind of audible ability to communicate.\u00a0 So how do they do it?\u00a0 How does one ant know what its job is and when it is supposed to do it?\u00a0 How do they know when the colony is threatened?\nI have seen many nests poisoned simply because they were seen. Preservation of the ant will enhance preservation of the Horned Lizard. Do you poison the Harvester ant and then say I never see Horned Lizards anymore?\nNo, harvester ant colonies should never be eliminated if at all possible. Harvester ants are much more docile than imported red fire ants (S. invicta) and are actually slow to sting, although the sting is painful. Harvester ants do compete with the invasive fire ants and elimination of the Harvester ants may make invasion by the imported fire ants more likely. Harvester ants are the primary natural diet of the Horned Lizard, which are species of concern or threatened in most states, and Horned Lizards have always disappeared from any areas where Harvester ants, their main food, dies out. Always leave the Harvester ants there, whether you see Horned Lizards around or not.

It is also  known for its ability to sting. Nests are found underground with a  small mound at the opening, which is littered with leftover food  debris. No live vegetation is found anywhere around the opening of the  nest. They generally seek seeds as a main source of food. During the  winter, the nest is sealed off and no activity is seen.\nThese  ants have actually been able to kill small pigs by their sudden and  vicious attacks. Harvester Ants will go after people and just about any  small animal that gets too close to their nest. A few types will leave  the stinger in their victim just as bees do, but most do not.\nLife Cycle:\nSwarming occurs several times each year, starting in June and July but  most prominently during August and September. The winged ants emerge in  large numbers, but most will not survive. The male dies right after  mating, and the female starts a new underground colony. Colonies may  last for quite a number of years, and can contain thousands of ants.  The colony becomes less active in temperatures over 120 degrees and  during the rainy season.\n\n\n\n\n\n          Click here to enter!\nNo purchase necessary! \n\nCorky's Radar  allows us to see where we couldn\u2019t see before.\n(Watch the Video)  \nMy accomplished mission in my business life has been to  programmatically approach Pest Control in Urban Southern California households.

It is also the single largest genus within the family Vespidae, with over 300 recognized species and subspecies. Their innate preferences for nest-building sites leads them to commonly build nests on human habitation, where they can be very unwelcome; although generally not aggressive, they can be provoked into defending their nests. All species are predatory, and they may consume large numbers of caterpillars, in which respect they are generally considered beneficial. The European paper wasp, Polistes dominula, was introduced into the US about 1981 and has quickly spread throughout most of the country, in most cases replacing native species within a few years. This species is very commonly mistaken for a yellowjacket, as it is black, strongly marked with yellow, and quite different from the native North American species of Polistes. Polistes wasps can be identified by their characteristic flight; their long legs dangle below their bodies, which are also more slender than a yellowjacket.[2]\n\n\nThe general life cycle of Polistes can be divided into four phases:[3]\nThe founding stage begins in the spring when a solitary female (the \"foundress\") or a small group of related females initiates the construction of a nest. The wasps begin by fashioning a petiole, a short stalk which will connect the new nest to a substrate (often the eave of a house or outbuilding), and building a single brood cell at the end of it. Further cells are added laterally in a hexagonal pattern, each cell surrounded by six others. Although nests can achieve impressive sizes, they almost always maintain a basic shape: petiolated (stellocyttarous), single-combed, unprotected, and open (gymnodomous).\nEggs are laid by the foundress directly into the brood cells and are guarded by the foundress and the assisting females (if present). After the first larvae hatch, the foundress feeds them via progressive provisioning, bringing softened caterpillar flesh to the larvae multiple times throughout their development (as opposed to the one-time provisioning seen in some other hymenopteran groups). Each of this first seasonal brood of new paper wasps is exclusively female and destined to a subordinate worker position inside the nest; they do not found their own nests and instead assist their mother in the care and maintenance of future sisters.\nSome foundress wasps do not build their own nests, but rather attempt to usurp that of another female. These usurpation attempts may or may not be successful, but almost always result in impressive displays of aggression and violence. Females may also adopt a more peaceful alternative reproduction strategy by joining the nest of a close relative (usually a sister) and working as assisting females (see above). In the latter case, evidence shows such cofounding females are generally, but not exclusively, close relatives.[3]\nThe worker phase usually begins in the early summer, roughly two months after colony initiation, with the emergence of the first workers. These new females take up most of the colony's work duties, foraging, caring for brood, and maintaining the structure of the nest. Around this time, those females which assisted in nest foundation (if present) are driven from the nest by aggressive behavior on the part of the foundress, and leave either to start their own late-season nests or usurp another's.\nThe reproductive phase of the colony begins when the first female reproductives (the gynes) emerge from their brood cells. These reproductives differ from their worker sisters by having increased levels of fat stores and cryoprotectant carbohydrate compounds (allowing them to survive the over-wintering period). These reproductives will contribute genes directly to the next generation, while their worker sisters will normally pass along their genes indirectly.\nOnce male reproductives emerge and both males and females disperse from the natal nest for mating flights, the so-called intermediate phase begins. Brood care and foraging behavior decline and worker numbers drop as dying individuals are no longer replaced by new ones. Intracolonial aggression increases and the social cohesion of the nest declines. In temperate Polistes species, individuals (almost exclusively inseminated females) gather in groups of up to 50 individuals and seek a sheltered location (called a hibernaculum) in which to over-winter.\nMorphologically, the foundress and subordinate reproductive members of the colony differ little. However, several studies have shown behavioral differentiation occurs among females both between and within generations. This has been best-studied in P. dominula. As mentioned above, there is very little differences in morphs. In Polistes exclamans the queen have different amounts of glucose, fructose and trehalose which lead to different cryoprotectant levels. This alters their survivability in different temperatures, increasing their ability to reproduce.\nPolistes spp. discriminate colony mates using an acquired (i.e. learned) cue, absorbing hydrocarbons from the natal nest at eclosion.[4] This cuticular hydrocarbon \"signature\" is derived both from the plant material and the foundress-applied substances from which the nest is made. Studies of Polistes fuscatus have researched the molecular basis of the recognition \"pheromone\" used by the wasps, and indicate at least some of the recognizable labels have the same chemical constituents as the adult cuticular hydrocarbons. Similar recognition is found in Polistes metricus.\nDominant individuals of P. dominulus have differing cuticular profiles to workers,[5] and the frequent observations of the dominant female stroking its gaster across the nest surface, combined with its staying on the nest for longer times than subordinates, suggests the dominant individual may contribute more to the nest odor.\nA study of P. carolina showed females do not preferentially feed their own progeny (as larvae),[6] so it may be the case that nest odor only serves as a likely indicator of relatedness, rather than a specific label of kinship.[citation needed]\nFurther to this recognition of nest-mates, a study on Polistes biglumis illustrated how foundresses discriminate between 'alien' eggs and their own, via differential oophagy.[7] The discrimination focused upon eggs destined to be reproductives, with 'alien' worker destined eggs allowed to remain on the nest. The authors speculated the benefits of allowing worker-destined eggs to remain (and so hatch to become workers which will then aid the colony) outweigh the costs of initially provisioning the resultant larvae..[citation needed]\nThe mechanism of differentiation was not elucidated, but was thought to be based upon differences in cuticular hydrocarbon odor. Whether the discriminatory oophagy was a result of decreased tolerance of alien odors during the later, reproductive phase of the colony cycle, or an actual discrimination between worker- and reproductive-destined eggs, remains to be supported with good evidence.[citation needed]\nRed paper wasp (Polistes annularis) nest\nPolistes sp. wasp on a nest\nPolistes wattii in Musandam Peninsula, Oman\nEuropean Polistes dominula, invasive in Western Australia\nPaper wasps huddling together in early winter\nAlong with the German and common wasps, the Asian and Australian paper wasps (Polistes chinensis and P. humilis) are considered pests in New Zealand. Arriving in 1979,[8] the Asian paper wasp has established itself on both North Island and northern parts of South Island. Because it competes with native species (such as the k\u0101k\u0101) for insects, nectar and honeydew,[9][10] it is a hindrance to conservation efforts.\nVarious other insects are parasites or parasitoids of Polistes, including flies (e.g., Sarcophagidae), mantispids, and wasps in the families Torymidae, Mutillidae (rarely), Braconidae, and Ichneumonidae (e.g. Latibulus argiolus). Some more specialized groups are more intimately associated with Polistes; this includes strepsipterans in the family Stylopidae (genus Xenos), wasps of the genus Elasmus (formerly placed in their own family, \"Elasmidae\"), and wasps in the family Trigonalidae."], ["Red wasp, what is it and how to get rid of them effectively.", "http://redwasp.net/", "No one likes dealing with the annoyance of an insect infestation of any kind. However, a wasp infestation can be especially daunting to deal with, as wasps come along with challenges and dangers that you don\u2019t have to worry about in regards to other pests. The red wasp is one of the leading types of wasps that you\u2019ll be seeing if you find yourself facing a wasp infestation of any type.\nThe red wasp is a particular type of paper wasp. Like other paper wasps, red wasps build papery, umbrella-esque nests that are made up of honeycomb-like cells. Each nest houses a single queen wasp whose job it is to lay eggs for the rest of the colony and a number of female wasp workers. Male wasps are born later on in the breeding season for mating purposes. Although the majority of the wasps die off each season, the queen typically remains hidden inside the nest over the winter in order to start a new colony come spring.\nThe red wasp builds its nest in areas that provide plenty of protection from the elements in order to preserve the health and integrity of the colony. This is exactly why wasp infestations can be such a big problem for humans. A human home\u2019s eaves, overhangs, light fixtures, and various nooks provide the environment the red wasp needs in order to survive.\nRed wasps definitely can defend themselves. Try to get into a wasp nest or catch it and you will find out! This is especially true with the red ones, because they are what I call \u201ccommunity\u201d wasps that create huge, round nests and organize themselves into huge families.\n\u00a0If you google \u201cred wasp\u201d, chances are you probably know how the nests usually look: like a big textured ball or a hemisphere. The material for their construction is usually a dry wood. The wasp bites off a piece of wood and thoroughly chews it with its surprisingly strong jaws, mixing it up with its saliva. The creation process resembles mixing of cement with water. When the material is ready the mother wasp creates a single brood cell and connects it to a tree, a wall or a substrate and continues to build more cells, interconnecting them in a hexagonal pattern. When the nest is ready and the material is dried down it looks like a super thin paper.\n\u00a0After the nest is ready the female wasp lays the egg in each brood cell and starts feeding them when they hatch. The baby wasp, larvae, is being fed through a progressive provisioning. The mother wasp thoroughly chews the flesh of the insects that she brings and feeds it to each larva. Part of larva ration is also honey. Nutrition factor plays a huge role in what kind of wasp the larva turns up to be \u2013 either it would be another working wasp or could become another \u201cfoundress\u201d. Male wasps are usually born to just help females reproduce and then die. When the working wasps grow up they immediately join their mother in construction work that she has started and also help her provide for the new generation of larva. The nest is getting bigger and if conditions allow the wasps surrounds it with several layers of sturdy walls.\n\u00a0If you take the old wasp nest and look at it you will see how much of its structure actually resembles a carton that you can separate in many different layers of celluloid. Some of the red wasps do not build their nest initially but rather take over the other nest that is already built by a different family. It is quite a remarkably violent attempt and usually looks like a war. In many other cases the foundress would choose a different way to build \u2013 find a close relative nest and build one right next to it. In some instances instead of building a new adjacent nest the red wasp will just join a relative nest under the foundress subordination. They start working as supporting units at that point.\n\u00a0The red wasp usually start building the nest as early as April and after the initial build it takes about two months for the first worker generation to appear. They start to expand on the nest build and provide food and support for brood. It is very interesting that after the first generation emerges the mother red wasp drives the initial females who helped her build the nest out of it and they have to either build a new one late in the season or take over some other one.\nIf you\u2019re facing an existing wasp\u2019s nest, it\u2019s important to note that the best time to deal with it would be at night, as the female worker wasps tend to be away during the day, only returning home in the evenings. Nighttime is also when the aggression level of the red wasp is at its lowest, reducing your chances of being stung or attacked.\nOne of the most popular and effective methods as far as how to get rid of wasps is to treat the nest with an aerosol insect killer made especially for treating a wasp infestation. These wasp killer aerosols are fast-acting and capable of shooting tough insecticide poisons up to 20 feet away, allowing you to keep a safe distance while you deal with the issue at hand.\nWait until you\u2019re sure all the wasps are dead and then be sure to remove the nest from the location. Otherwise, you run the risk of having other wasps simply move right in to replace the ones you just killed. Always use caution during nest removal just in case one or two of the wasps are still alive.\nYou\u2019ll also want to make sure you take wasp control steps to ensure the wasps don\u2019t come back. Wasps are drawn to food left out in open containers and in trash bins. Avoid leaving food containers open out of doors in spring and summer when wasps are out and about. Also be sure to keep garbage cans tightly sealed at all times. Try to seal off openings to your home and garage to the best of your ability as well. Just a few simple measures like these can make a huge difference when it comes to dealing with wasps for sure.\nRed Wasp Copyright \u00a9 2014.

Paper wasps belong to the genus Polistes. Worldwide, there are over 200 species. These wasps measure 1.9 to 3.2 cm in length. Their narrow bodies are most commonly dark brown in color, with black wings and yellow markings. Some even appear similar to yellow jackets in coloration.\nThese insects are called paper wasps due to the construction of their nests. Paper wasp nests are made from plant material combined with saliva and appear to be made from paper. Their nests include numerous compartments within which wasps lay their eggs and rear their young. The nests typically do not have an outer shell with the cells of the nest visible. In fact, it somewhat resembles an umbrella and is the reason they may be called umbrella wasps. These nests are frequently found in sheltered areas, such as door frames, window sill and the eaves of houses.\nPaper wasps feed on nectar and pollen, although they also hunt for insects such as caterpillars with which to nourish their colonies\u2019 larvae. As larvae develop into adults, they assist in expanding the nest and nurturing future generations.\nPaper wasps are considered beneficial because they assist in pollination by feeding on nectar, and they control pest insect populations by feeding them to their larvae. However, despite their ecological benefits, paper wasp nests should not be permitted to develop in or near the home. Stings from paper wasps are extremely painful and may produce serious reactions to people who are allergic to the venom.\nRemoving a paper wasp nest may be dangerous.

This particular species has a red or rust colored body with smoky brown to black wings. They are 1\u20442\u201d to 11\u20444\u201d in length and have slender bodies with long legs that dangle below their bodies. These wasps have a very long stinger at the end of their abdomens. They have a distinctive head with chewing mouth parts, short elbowed antennae and large eyes. Other species of Paper Wasps can also be brown, orange or yellow in color. They build open, single comb paper nests with hexagonal cells. Their nests are shaped like an upside down umbrella.\r\n\nRed Wasp colonies contain 3 types of individuals or castes: queens, workers and males. The colony begins in the spring when a mated female leaves her hibernation spot to build a nest. Nests are built from wood and plant material that is chewed and mixed with the wasp saliva to form hexagonal cells. The queen lays eggs in the cells of the nest and the resulting larvae are fed chewed up meat and insect parts from other insects. The emerging young become the workers who tend to the larvae and protect the nest. All members of the colony spend nights on the nest and then subordinates forage and become active during the day. The queen is no bigger than the workers and has no distinguishing characteristic, other than she rarely leaves the nest. In late summer or early fall, workers begin to die off and reproductives leave the nest to mate. After mating, the males die and the fertilized females find a protected place to overwinter. Social Wasps use their nests for only one season.\nPaper Wasps can be beneficial to gardeners since they prey on troublesome insects such as caterpillars, flies and beetle larvae. The prey are then chewed up and fed to the colony\u2019s larvae. \nThe disadvantages of these wasps are that they will aggressively defend their nest and their stings can be very painful. Nests are generally built in areas that invite frequent human interaction, such as under the eaves of houses and buildings or attached to trees or shrubs. And unlike bees, one wasp can sting multiple times.  For people with allergies, these stings can be very dangerous.\nWhen attempting to treat wasps, it is important to wear protective clothing, such as a bee suit or a long-sleeved shirt, coveralls, gloves, and eye protection. Once the nest is located, aerosol \u201cfreeze sprays\u201d can be effective at knocking down wasps to prevent stings, and are good to use from a safe distance away. It is best to administer treatment at night or in the early morning when the wasps are less active, and all wasps in the colony will be located on the nest. It is important to kill as many of the wasps in the colony as possible. The next step is to remove the nest and treat the area where the nest was attached. This way, any returning colony members looking for the nest will be exposed to the insecticide and die. \nTreating wasp infestations can be dangerous, so it is often best left to professional Pest Control Operators. RP Lee Pest Control has handled the treatment and removal of many wasp nests in our area. Contact RP Lee today at (979) 690-8622 if you have a problem with wasps at your home or business. \nRule number 1 is to be cautious and always avoid disturbing a wasp nest. Check for nests under the eaves of buildings before working in those areas. When trimming trees or shrubs, be careful of the possibility that a nest could be located where you are working. \nWhen planning to be outdoors, avoid wearing attractive bright colored yellow, orange or blue clothing, as well as the use of hairsprays, colognes, perfumes and sweet-smelling lotion. Wasps tend to forage in open garbage cans in outdoor areas, such as parks or recreation areas, and will be attracted to the colognes or perfumes worn by people nearby.  \nIf a single wasp does fly at you or near you, as difficult as it may be to do so, do not swat at it. Swatting may increase the chance of a sting. Simply remain calm and still, then slowly move away from the wasp. However, if you have accidentally disturbed a nest, it is best to run away and leave the area of the nest as soon as possible, to avoid an attack by multiple wasps swarming to defend the nest.\nRP Lee Termite & Pest Control services College Station, Bryan, Caldwell, Brenham, Hill Top Lakes, Hearne, Navasota, Franklin, Somerville, Hempstead, Calvert, and Cameron, So For Quick & Courteous Service call us today or schedule your service here on-line."], ["Red Wasps are everywhere!

Several species exist in Iowa. These wasps are long and slender with a narrow, thread-like waist. Some are a solid steel blue or black but others have additional yellow markings ... After completing the mud nest the female captures several insects or spiders to provision the cells. Prey are stung and paralyzed before being placed in the nest. A single egg is deposited on the prey within each cell, and the cell sealed with mud. After the wasp has finished a series of cells, she departs and does not return. The larvae that hatch from the eggs feed on the prey items left by the adult wasp. New adult wasps emerge to start the process over again. Wasps usually evoke a great deal of anxiety or fear. However, solitary wasps such as the mud daubers do not defend their nest the way social wasps such as hornets and yellowjackets do. Mud daubers are very unlikely to sting, even when thoroughly aroused. They may sting if mishandled. Control of these insects is not warranted since they normally pose little threat. Rather, mud daubers should be regarded as beneficial, since they remove and use as prey many species of spiders which most people find disagreeable. The mud nests can be scraped off and discarded at night if they are objectionable, or wasp and hornet aerosol sprays can be used to treat nests if desired. There is no proven method that is effective in discouraging wasps from building nests in sheltered or protected areas. Prompt and frequent removal of nests is suggested in areas favored by the wasps.

Therefore, carpenter bees dont care what you put on the wood. They dont actually eat the wood so no stains will readily repel them or kill them. I have seen them burrow into cedar, stained decks, and painted, solid wood doors. Also, just for educational purposes, the bald faced hornet(Very aggresive, makes large paper nests in the shape of a football) is actually a wasp. The yellow jacket is also a wasp. The European hornet(Also very aggressive) is a true hornet. The red wasps you see are called paper wasps or umbrella wasps and are not very aggressive unless disturbed.\nPaulding Com member\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPosted 22 March 2011 - 09:47 PM\n\nSealants were not my first choice, but I have used certain paints on my trim when I lived in Marietta that the bees would not touch...although they would fly around and check it out. Also had my trim painted here at my home in PC, and same thing...NO carpenter bees. I'll have to ask my painter what kind he used, but he said that the bees would not get through it....and he was right.\nSuper Icon\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPosted 22 March 2011 - 09:55 PM\n\nYou may be correct. If you find out, please let me know. I know that when lead paint was used the bees would not burrow as much. Of course that is not legal anymore. I also heard of people mixing gas/diesel into the gas and that helped as well. Again, please let me know. I could help out my customers plus make alot of money with that type of info.\nIcon\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPosted 22 March 2011 - 10:20 PM\n\nExactly...that's why we never got stung by one. Yellow Jackets (Vespula Wasps) are probably the most agreesive, right up there with Hornets. But I still think Yellow Jackets are worse.\nSuper Icon\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPosted 22 March 2011 - 10:25 PM\n\nI don't think we are speaking about the same bug. The red wasps, or Mahogany wasps as some people call them, are vicious and aggressive. My mom was randomly attacked by them last year, and actually had to jump in a nearby pond to get them to leave off of her. She was stung 14 times in total, and each sting swelled up to a bit larger than a golf ball. We tried to get her to go to the hospital, but she refused. She basically was bed ridden for several days before they started to go go away. I was at her house today, after having had them exterminated last year, where we destroyed 3 nests, and they have come back, and chased us out of the back yard. These things are vicious and evil, and must be killed by any means necessary. If anyone has a good method of locating all the nests and destroying them, please let me know. My method last year obviously didn't get them all.\nPaulding Com member\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPosted 22 March 2011 - 11:21 PM\n\nPaulding Com member\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPosted 23 March 2011 - 07:58 AM\n\nI dont know about that.

At least then the honeybees won't be on them. Even something as simple as putting seven dust on bushes can end up being carried by the honeybees back to their nest and wipe out the entire colony. Happened to a fellow I know's beehives - 70,000+ honeybees wiped out overnight. The benefits of having the honeybees pollinate those flowers vastly outweighed the minor damage done by a few harmful bugs. Thats the reason alot of helpful or harmless insects aren't seen very much anymore.\nA Good Old Boy\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPosted 23 March 2011 - 08:11 AM\n\nIcon\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPosted 23 March 2011 - 10:25 AM\n\nI dont know about that.

Red wasp stings generally lead to nothing more than a temporary welt that's painful, inflamed and itchy. Most of the things you need to treat red wasp stings, as well as stings from other irascible insects, such as bees, hornets and yellow jackets, can be found in your home.\nRed wasps, also known as paper wasps, make their nests under the eaves of your house or in or on other structures, as well as plants and trees. According to Texas A&M's Department of Entomology, only female red wasps can hurt you, as male wasps lack a stinger. The female red wasp can sting you repeatedly when she feels her home turf is threatened. If the wasp's nest is in a place where you and your family frequently traffic, dislodge it using a high-pressure water hose. Clear the area and stand at a fair distance so wasps won't commence a retaliatory strike against you or other passers-by.\nIf you've been stung by a red wasp, your first order of business is to quickly remove the stinger so it doesn't continue to release venom\u2013the substance that causes your skin to swell and redden. You can do this in one of several ways. The National Institutes of Health suggests using a blunt object such as a butter knife and scraping it over the sting carefully. Alternately, use tweezers or your fingertips to remove the stinger. Be careful not to break or put pressure on the venom sac at the end of the stinger, cautions the NIH; you could accidentally express more wasp venom into your skin.\nAfter the wasp stinger has been removed, wash the stung area of skin well with soap and water. The sting will no doubt smart. To relieve swelling, use a cold compress, such as ice wrapped in a towel or washcloth, and apply it to your skin. The Florida Agency for Health Care Administration suggests putting the compress on the skin for 10 minutes, then removing it for 10 minutes, repeating the process as needed. If you or the person you're treating has problems with circulation, apply the compress for shorter durations.\nA simple home remedy for insect stings suggest by MayoClinic.Com is mixing up 3 teaspoons baking soda to 1 teaspoon water and smearing the paste on the bite several times a day. You may also head to your nearest drugstore to pick up 0.5 or 1 percent hydrocortisone cream or calamine lotion to assuage itching and pain. MayoClinic.com also suggests taking an oral nonprescription antihistamine that contains diphenhydramine or chlorpheniramine maleate.\nOne or two people out of every 1,000 have life-threatening allergic reactions to insect stings, according to the University of California Statewide Integrated Pest Management Program. You may notice symptoms of wasp sting hypersensitivity immediately after being stung or up to 30 minutes later. Hives, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain and headache may signal sting hypersensitivity. More dire symptoms of anaphylaxis\u2013the most severe type of allergic response\u2013include shock, dizziness, difficulty breathing and a swollen throat. If you notice these symptoms, do not try to treat yourself.

Wear red trousers... or tie a paper ...", "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2406094/Want-ward-wasps-Wear-red-trousers--tie-paper-bag-nearest-tree-And-DONT-wear-aftershave.html", "\nBy\nGuy Walters\n\n\nPublished:\n  15:54 EST, 29 August 2013\n\n | \nUpdated:\n  15:54 EST, 29 August 2013\n\n\n         130\nView  comments\nAt this time of year we may well find ourselves spending more time swatting wasps than eating\n \nAs millions of us try to enjoy the last\u00a0 alfresco meals of the summer this weekend, we may well find ourselves spending more time swatting than eating as we try to get rid of a particularly annoying and uninvited guest \u2014 the Vespula vulgaris, more commonly known as the wasp.\nThis is proving to be a particularly good year for wasps \u2014 their numbers have exploded thanks to a particularly long, cold winter. Having enjoyed an lengthy hibernation, they are now emerging in their billions to feast on the glut of insects that are around during late summer. This, then, is going to be the Weekend of the Wasp.\nSo how can you protect yourself, and what should you do if one of the little blighters does sting you? \nGuy Walters investigates\u2026\nAlthough wasps do not have teeth, they certainly have a very sweet tooth. In the early summer they tend to go for protein-based foods such as meat, which they need to build muscle, but by this time of year,\u00a0 they\u2019ve moved on to pudding \u2014 in all likelihood, your pudding.\nThey particularly like fruit \u2014 the riper and more rotten the better \u2014 although, annoyingly for picnickers, wasps will be attracted to anything sugary. Fizzy drinks, ice cream, sweet sauces and chocolate are all great temptations. And they like wine, too! So if you want to reduce wasp numbers, leave that lot in the fridge.\nIf you\u2019re eating outside, try to keep as much food as possible in sealed containers until you are ready to eat it.\nWasps are also attracted by certain colours, especially white and yellow. Like most insects, they cannot see the colour red, so it\u2019s worth investing in a red shirt, and \u2014 if you can withstand the mockery of your friends \u2014 some red trousers.\nIn the early summer wasps tend to go for protein-based foods such as meat, but in later summer they prefer sweet things - so keep all food covered on a picnic\n \nDon\u2019t, whatever you do, splash on aftershave or perfume. Even the scents in hairspray and hair gel are attractive, so go easy on your coiffure. Try to avoid scented deodorants, too, and if you are wearing suncream, avoid any that contain a fragrance.\nIf a wasp does start getting too near, the worst thing you can do is start flapping and flailing your arms in a panic. Such movements only excite and enrage wasps, and make it much more likely that you will be stung. Instead, stay calm and still, or slowly\u00a0 walk away.\nAnd don\u2019t, whatever you do, disturb their nests, which look like large, papery, grey pear drops. A wasp\u2019s nest is his castle, and\u00a0 he will defend it with utmost ferocity. If you see a nest, leave it well alone.\nWasps are also attracted to light, so as it starts to get dark, try to avoid switching on outdoor lamps or using candles until you really have to.\nTo keep wasps at bay replicate a rival wasp nest by hanging a brown paper bag in a tree, or buy an imitation one\n \nThere are some smells that wasps reputedly do not like, including eucalyptus, mint and wormwood. So try dabbing some eucalyptus oil around the table, and place a mint plant in the middle of it rather than a jug of flowers. If you do have wormwood \u2014 and not many of us grow it because it\u2019s poisonous \u2014 then dried cuttings will help drive wasps away.\nIf you fancy something more heavy-duty, there are numerous insect repellents you can spray on your skin that promise to drive away wasps.\nThe ones that work best are those with N,N-Diethyl-meta-\u00a0 toluamide \u2014 what most of us know as DEET. Try Repel 100 (\u00a37.29 for 120ml from amazon.co.uk) or Repel Once (\u00a38.95 for 100ml from Boots), which claim to be effective for hours.\nHowever, the best way to deter wasps is to make them believe there is already another colony of wasps in the area. Wasps are fiercely territorial, and will attack other wasps invading their territory. As a result, they are very wary of approaching when they see a nest that is not theirs. The simplest way to do this is make a paper bag in the shape of a nest and hang it from a nearby branch or a parasol. However, to make life easier, several companies make fake nests \u2014 perhaps the best is the Waspinator (\u00a316.95, waspinator.co.uk), which mimics the contours of a real nest.\nIt is a myth that wasps do not serve any useful ecological function. They help pollinate flowers and crops, and they prey on many other insect pests. They eat ticks and they feed houseflies to their young. In short, without wasps, we\u2019d have many more pests.\nAs a result, some people see killing wasps as just as unethical as killing bees. Furthermore, killing one, particularly by squashing it, can actually make matters worse, as their dying bodies release a pheromone that causes other wasps to draw near and attack. \nCrushing a wasp with the flat of your knife may earn you admiring plaudits from your fellow diners but, in fact, you\u2019re only likely to attract reinforcements to the table.\nKilling a wasp may solve more problems than it solves, but there are several ways to trap them and thus keep them away from  you and your food\nIf you really feel you must kill a wasp, perhaps the most tried-and-tested way to dispatch wasps is to build a trap. \nThere are many methods of doing this but one of the oldest is to fill a jar with water, then place an upside-down flower pot on top, with something sweet like jam smeared under the rim of the hole. The wasps will be attracted to the jam, fall into the water and drown.\nAnother \u2014 though not foolproof method \u2014 is to spray wasps with hairspray, as this freezes them and causes them to fall out of the air. However, the principal drawback of this method is that other wasps will be attracted to the scent of the spray.\nIf you are being plagued by a wasp that won\u2019t stop circling your plate, but you don\u2019t like the idea of killing it, keep a spray bottle filled with water to hand. \nSpritz the wasp with water, as it will struggle to fly when saturated. As it slows down, you can trap it in a glass jar and release it when you have finished your meal.\nIf, despite the flower-pot traps, decoy nests, red trousers and a thick layer of insect repellent, you are stung by a wasp and start feeling dizzy, or find yourself unable to breathe, or see large hives breaking out on your skin away from the site of the bite, you should seek immediate medical attention.\nHowever, a slight swelling around the bite is a perfectly normal reaction. Hypochondriacs may claim that such a reaction means they have an allergy, but this is simply not the case. Sometimes the swelling can seem alarmingly large and last for days, but, again, this is normal.\nThere are plenty of widely available antihistamines, such as Piriton, which come in tablet and syrup form and will deal with the reaction very quickly. And creams such as Anthisan will reduce any itchiness or swelling.\nFor a more natural remedy, apply a cotton-wool ball soaked in kitchen vinegar to the sting, or dissolve a tablespoon of baking powder in a large bowl of water and submerge the affected area in it. A cube of ice also works wonders to soothe the swelling. \nAnd beware: wasps, unlike bees, can sting you multiple times. \nUndesirable though wasps may be, take some comfort from the fact that as long as there are wasps buzzing around your bowl of strawberries and cream, it is at least still summer and the first chilly days of autumn haven\u2019t yet driven them into hibernation.\n\u00a0\nShare what you think\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\n                        The views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n                    \nWe are no longer accepting comments on this article.\n\n\n\n      Comedienne Joan Rivers dies at age 81 - just a week after routine throat procedure left her in a coma\n    \n\nCopy link to paste in your message\nPublished by Associated Newspapers Ltd\nPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"], ["Paper Wasps | Missouri Department of Conservation", "http://mdc.mo.gov/discover-nature/field-guide/paper-wasps", "Paper wasps are the most familiar of Missouri's social wasps. Their tan, papery nests are easy to identify: a single layer of hexagonal cells, arranged side-by-side like a honeycomb, and suspended by a single stalk from some overhanging shelter (such as the eaves of a house or other building). The wasps themselves look something like skinny yellow jackets. They are black or brown, often with rusty or yellowish markings, and fly with their legs dangling.\nPaper wasps are commonly seen chewing bits of wood from untreated wooden fences, park benches, and so on, which they mix with saliva and use to build their remarkable paper nests.\nMany species and genera of sand wasps occur in Missouri. They nest in the ground during summer. They are found in many habitats but most often in open, sandy areas along rivers.\nMost ichneumon wasps are harmless, although the long ovipositor of the female is intimidating. Their larvae live as parasites inside caterpillars and other larval insects.\nYellowjackets are bee-sized social wasps that build paper nests, usually underground. Their defensive stinging makes them a major pest when they nest near people. If you want to eliminate a yellowjacket nest, consult a licensed exterminator.\nBald-faced hornets are fairly large wasps that are primarily black, with white or ivory markings on the face, thorax, and toward the tip of the abdomen. The large, rounded, papery, gray nests of this social insect are frequently seen in natural history displays.\nHorntails look a lot like wasps but have a taillike spine that projects from the tip of the abdomen. Their cylindrical bodies also lack the narrow waist so common in wasps.\nVelvet ants are not true ants. True ants are social insects, while velvet ants are a group of solitary wasps. Female velvet ants are wingless throughout their lives; males are winged.\nA large solitary wasp, the great golden digger wasp is found throughout Missouri. The abdomen is orange in front and black at the end. The head and thorax have golden hairs. Like all solitary wasps, this species is not aggressive.\nMDC protects and manages Missouri's fish, forest, and wildlife resources.\nWe also facilitate your participation in resource-management activities, and we provide opportunities for you to use, enjoy and learn about nature.\nFind out more\nMDC protects and manages Missouri's fish, forest, and wildlife resources.\nWe also facilitate your participation in resource-management activities, and we provide opportunities for you to use, enjoy and learn about nature.\nCheck out the featured picture and other images at the MDC Media Gallery\n        "], ["Red paper wasps harmless unless provoked - Southeast ...", "http://www.semissourian.com/story/1663667.html", "\n\n [Order this photo]\n\n\nPictured here is a red paper wasp, one of 22 species of paper wasps known to exist in North America. \n\n\nPaper wasps are so called because they build paper nests. I once observed one carefully cutting away small shreds of bark from a cedar tree for nest building. Hornets and yellow jackets also belong to the paper wasp family. \n\n\nRed paper wasps often build their nest safe from the weather inside man-made buildings such as sheds and barns. Their nests will be attached to a ceiling area. The nest is where the young are reared, and, if disturbed, adult red paper wasps will aggressively defend it. Some kinds of paper wasps are notorious for chasing after an agitator, but the red paper wasp will usually chase for only a short distance. More likely, they will vigorously swarm the immediate nest area. \n\n\nAnyone unlucky enough to disturb a nest of red paper wasps should vacate the area immediately. Never stand and battle these wasps. Their stings are quite painful and will leave a red welt and possibly swelling of the sting site.\n\n\nI photographed this red wasp as it landed on a white plastic lawn chair beside me. It posed no threat. It was out alone searching for food. Red paper wasps do provide a special service to gardeners by devouring plant-eating caterpillars. They also feed small caterpillars to their larvae in the nest.\n\n\nThrough the Woods is a weekly nature photo column by Aaron Horrell.

A solitary queen emerges from hibernation in the early spring and builds a small nest using chewed wood pulp. She raises the first generation of workers on her own. After they emerge, these workers collect food while the queen restricts herself to laying eggs. The larvae are fed pre-chewed caterpillars caught by adults, while the adults feed on nectar. Nests are typically small, usually a few dozen workers, but may contain as many as 100 workers. As fall approaches, colonies produce males and new queens, which leave the nest to mate. After mating, the new queens burrow into the ground where they spend the winter. All workers, the males, and the old queen perish around November. The same nest is not used again.\nDamage: These wasps are aggressive and will defend their nest if provoked. They deliver a painful sting. Their nests do not cause structural damage to buildings.\nBenefits: These insects are voracious predators of several residential and agricultural pests. They are especially valuable near vegetable gardens, where they provide natural and free control of herbivorous caterpillars. \nManagement: If the wasps are present in an area where they will not bother people, it is best to leave them. They will be gone after the first frost; and, in the meantime, they will reduce the populations of local pest species. They do not present a danger unless the nest is disturbed, and they will not return to the same nesting site the following year. \n\r\nIf control is necessary, use an approved \"Wasp & Hornet\" spray that propels a stream of insecticide 15-25 feet. Treatment is most effective in the evening when the majority of the insects are on the nest. Be sure to dress appropriately. Wear eye protection, a long-sleeved shirt, long pants and boots, and secure your sleeves and pant legs. Establish an unobstructed escape route and be ready to move quickly away from the area in case any of the insects fly towards you. Stand a safe distance from the nest and slowly approach while spraying with a sweeping motion (follow specific directions of the insecticide). If you require illumination, use a flashlight covered with red cellophane for a light - wasps cannot see red. You may need to repeat the treatment on two or three consecutive evenings. You may want to call in a professional, as there is a risk of being stung.\nSting: If a paper wasp approaches you, slowly raise your hands to your face and walk away. Remain calm! Avoid swatting at the wasp or running, as quick movements may elicit an attack. If possible, avoid the use of scented perfumes and soaps, and wear gray, white or tan to reduce the chances of a wasp approaching you. Unlike the honey bee, paper wasps have a smooth stinger and can sting more than once. If you are stung, cooling the area with ice may be soothing.\nRemember! Insect stings can elicit a life-threatening, allergic reaction in some individuals. Check with your physician to determine what symptoms require a visit to the emergency room. Never attempt any control measure if you have a known allergy to insect stings.\nFurther sources: Turillazzi, S. and M.J.West-Eberhard. 2002. Natural History and Evolution of Paper Wasps.

They are slender with  narrow waists and have long legs. Paper wasps are reddish-brown to dark red or  orange depending on the species. Females have a stinger that is not barbed and  allows for repeated stinging. \nCan paper wasps  harm my family or employees? \nThe paper wasp, in most cases, is not an aggressive insect  unless something comes too close or disturbs their nest. The sting of a paper  wasp is similar to that of other wasps, but since they do not have a barbed  stinger, they can sting repeatedly. Most stings only cause minor medical  problems, however some stings may cause serious health problems that require  immediate medical attention. \nHow can I tell if I have paper wasps?\nPaper wasp nests are often found hanging under the eaves of  buildings, porches, piers, trees, and beneath decks. These wasps will also nest  in voids and other protected sites such as gas grills, electrical outlet boxes,  hose reels, attics, and crawl spaces. Paper wasps like to build their nests on  the south or southeast side of a structure. Nests are comb shaped and resemble  an upside down umbrella.\nHow does Batzner get  rid of paper wasps? \nYour Batzner pest control professional will come to your  property to identify the nesting sites and determine the proper treatment  method. Once treatment is applied it may take up to 72 hours to see a reduction  in activity at the nesting site. A preventative exterior treatment is also available  to deter paper wasps from building nests in your eaves, soffits, and peaks.\nWhat steps can I take to control or prevent paper wasps myself?\nThere are do-it-yourself products available. If you choose  to try controlling paper wasps on your own, do not treat wasps nest on a ladder  or raised height unless you have proper stinging insect proof clothing  including a head net. Once you use a product on the nest, the wasps will become  aggressive and respond quickly. Paper wasps can sting repeatedly.\r\n              If you continue to see activity despite your repeated  attempts, give us a call and we\u2019d be happy to assist you. "], ["Paper Wasp: pictures, information, classification and more", "http://www.everythingabout.net/articles/biology/animals/arthropods/insects/wasps/paper_wasp/", "Most paper wasps measure about 2 cm (0.75 in) long and are black, brown, or reddish in color with yellow markings. Paper wasps will defend their nest if attacked. Adults forage for nectar, their source of energy, and for caterpillars to feed the larvae (young). They are natural enemies of many garden insect pests. A widespread North American species is the golden paper wasp.\nThe nests of most species are suspended from a single, central stalk and have the shape of an upside-down umbrella. Some tropical species make nests that hang in a vertical sheet of cells. Plant and wood fibers are collected by the wasps, mixed with saliva, and chewed into a papier-m\u00each?-like material that is formed into the thin cells of the nest. The nests are constructed in protected places, such as under the eaves of buildings or in dense vegetation. Normally a colony of several to several dozen paper wasps inhabit the nest.\nThe colony is founded in early spring, soon after the queens (mated females) emerge from hibernation. As the colony matures, males and the next year's queens are produced. These queens mate with males and are the only members of the colony to survive through winter. In late summer or fall, the founding queen, workers (unmated females), and males all die. The newly mated queens hibernate, typically in piles of wood, in vegetation, or in holes. The following spring they emerge and begin the cycle anew. A similar life cycle is found in bumble bees.\nIn most temperate species of paper wasps, colonies are founded by one female who dominates the colony and lays most of the eggs. This female constructs the nest, lays eggs, forages, and raises the first generation of offspring. She then stops foraging, becomes the queen, and rules by dominating her offspring of workers. This is a classic dominance hierarchy with the queen maintaining control through aggressive interactions. Each individual in line maintains dominance over all others below her through confrontation and aggressive interactions. If the queen dies or is otherwise lost, the most aggressive worker takes over. This worker begins laying eggs and continues to dominate all below her. Since the workers have not mated, they can only lay unfertilized eggs, which develop into males, a typical trait in wasps.\nSome queens that are unsuccessful at establishing their own nest may join another queen, submitting to her dominance and becoming a worker. Studies have shown that such individuals, called joiners, are most often sisters of the queen. Since this individual mated the previous fall, her eggs can develop into workers and she could become the next queen if the founding queen is lost. Occasionally a joiner dominates the founding queen and takes over the nest, a behavior known as usurpation. In such rare cases, the usurper becomes the queen and the previous queen becomes a worker.\nScientific classification: Paper wasps are in the genus Polistes in the family Vespidae, which also includes potter wasps, yellow jackets, and hornets.

Just this morning I realized Ive got quite a build-up of new \u2018friends\u2019 on the roof of my house. I found out about them from my crazy husband and his friend who were out having a cigarette. They came running in quickly, afraid of the evil bugs lol. Between my husband and son im the big bad bug killer because they are both highly creeped out by the creepy crawlies. Never bothered me. But back to the main event\u2026.\nI went to check these, what I believe to be wasps, out and ive been searching all morning on what kind they could be. They are quite large for any wasp ive ever seen. Their bodies appear to be hard and are a darker red tent. The wings appear to be either a crimson purple or a black tent. Antennae are straight and black.\nMe being the curious person I am I stood out there for awhile to watch them for a bit. I might be wrong but I think they are doing some sort of strange mating thing. One or more will wait for another to come and \u2018clean\u2019 their head by, what appears to be, bitting on it. Then once they\u2019ve done this for a moment , both parties back off and clean and rub on themselves almost as if applying a lubricant of some sort.\nAgain, im no expert and these are just theories of my observations. I snapped a few pics as best I could with the lack of good zoom on my camera.\nI would love to know what this species is and definately if they are something that needs to be taken care of immediately due to my small child. Thanks for everything!\nCurious Mind\nLittle Rock, Arkansas\nRed Wasps\nDear Curious Mind,\nThese look to us like Red Wasps, Polistes carolina. Wasps in the genus Polistes are known as Paper Wasps and though they are not aggressive, they can sting if their nest is disturbed. Paper Wasps chew wood pulp into a material used to build the nest. We suspect they are attracted to the exposed wood beneath the peeling paint on your roof. It is possible that the nest is in the eaves of the house since BugGuide indicates: \u201cThis species may prefer to nest in very sheltered locations, such as hollow trees\u2013this should be investigated.\u201d A similar species with the same range is Polistes perplexus, also pictured on BugGuide. In our opinion, these Red Wasps pose no threat to your small child, but the wasps will protect their nest.\n\nUpdate: Sat, Mar 14, 2009 at 6:08 PM\nThanks very much for responding and especially finding out what they are. Im very relieved to know that these arent agressive by nature. I think it will put us all at ease. Now Im not so eager to call someone to get rid of them. They have to have a home someplace also. And there\u2019s enough room for everyone to keep peace. I hate to kill things if there\u2019s no need. Thanks once again and keep up the awesome work!!\nEd. Note:\u00a0 April 11, 2011.\u00a0 We have gotten so many comments of first hand accounts of aggressive Red Wasps that we feel compelled to withdraw our statement that the Red Wasps pose no threat.\u00a0 Something is making Red Wasps angry with the human presence.\u00a0 Perhaps this is a newly introduced species or subspecies that is more aggressive than the native species.\u00a0 For whatever reason, it seems Red Wasps may be initiating attacks that do not directly result from a threatened nest.\nThe red wasp I like is Polistes annularis which you can see on Bugguide.\nThese are very common in North Alabama.  They truly aren\u2019t aggressive at all but their sting is quite painful.  Other than removing nests near doorways and in high traffic areas, there\u2019s no need to kill them.  They\u2019ll leave you alone if you show the same courtesy.\nCurious Mind I used to live in the Little Rock area and we had Red Wasps in the eves of our house as well and our batch or batches was VERY agressive. I watched them daily and they would actually post guards at the entrance to the nest. They would however give a warning flight at you first, then be ready. I have found the Reds to much more agressive than a regular Paper Wasp. I have lived in Arkansas all my life and the Red Wasp is in my opinion and experience more agressive than a standard Paper Wasp.\nI live in Tenn. These that we have will sit on edge of house. You can see them turn their head and look at you. Then they will chase you a long way!!! They are not red they are ORANGE!! They are very aggressive!!! They are bigger than a red wasp. My husband has sprayed and they eventually come back,  We ask other people and they have never seen them. They are the most aggressive thing I have ever seen!!! What are they??????\nCheri, I would be interested in where you live in TN. We live in northwest TN, Dresden and we have these orange wasps. You are right, they are very \u201corange\u201d and not red at all. They are much larger and are very aggressive. My husband was stung by one on the hand and had a horrible time with the sting. He has been bitten by snakes, more than once, and didn\u2019t have this much reaction! They must have alot of poison in their bite!! We have talked to others and no one seems to know about orange wasps, only red ones! They have chased him several times when he is mowing the yard. I\u2019m scared to even be outside!\nPaula, you and Cheri may have encounter hornets which are larger the the smaller wasp.  The average wasp is about .5 inches long and the hornet .7 inches long.  Unlike bees, wasps (hornets) can sting repeatedly.  Here in NC we have red & black, black, and yellow & black wasps.  Sometimes they come inside the house but these are not aggressive and I just prop the door open so the can fly out.\nI live in Missouri and have been invaded by these orange wasps as well. They definitely are not hornets. As a matter of fact, they will destroy hornet nests.\nThey are very large, some over 2.5 inches in length and are very aggressive, will strike for no reason and leave large welts even if not allergic. They nest in places that cannot be seen or gotten to easily. I use moth ball bags to slow their nest-building, otherwise a tennis racket.\nAt least in the Texas Hill Country, Red Wasps are very agressive!  And they will follow you for several hundred feet chasing you away from their nest.\nJust found one of these indoors this late on a very cold December night.  I\u2019m concerned there could be more in my attic.  I don\u2019t know where this one came from.  I just love this website.  Yall have helped me identify several critters that have showed up in my yard, the oddest of which would be the arrowhead flatworm.  Thanks!\nI agree with SixGun I have red wasps around my house here in Oklahoma, and I have been stung by them at least five times in three years. They will fly at you, and even chase you. The straw that broke the camel\u2019s back for me was when I got up one morning, donned my robe and flip flops, and walked to the kitchen for breakfast before work. I opened the door to the refrigerator and felt incredible burning pain in my foot. A red wasp had stung me on the foot!! It had gotten into the house somehow and as it lay on the floor, its final dying act was to crawl onto my flip flop, and sting me on the foot! I was just getting breakfast in my own home!! Needless to say I shared my pain with the little ____. Now I put out traps for them every year and I would advise anyone to do the same, they ARE agressive.\n[...] opinion, these Red Wasps pose no threat to your small child, but the wasps will protect their nest. Red Wasps | What's That Bug? I've no idea what kind of spider it is, other than dead.      Do not argue with an idiot. He will [...]\nI will back up sixgun with a SHOTGUN!\nMake NO mistake about it, we have property in East Texas, between Canton, & Tyler.\nI live in Dallas, I have been all over Texas in my 52 plus years and never met a meaner strain of yellow jacket, or hornet, than the RED WASP, EXTREMELY AGGRESSIVE. As with most , never cast a shadow across their guarded space, and for sure always, ALWAYS be aware of your surroundings around any place they might build. I opened the bar b Que one late summer evening out on Larry\u2019s Lake ( a friend of mine whom was killed in a head on collision several years back when I was away living in Las Vegas, I returned to confirm his untimely death, while out at his property, which NoBoDEE has moved a ting in the two plus years since he died except myself and my son, I do miss him dearly.\nWhile we foraged about the property now going back to nature (26 acre lake, includes the island we built a log cabin on back in 1983) I was chased away from almost every structure by the RED DEVILS, whom have just about all but taken over everything.\nI walked out onto the pier which has about fallen in. I was so sad to see his property he loved and cared for so much. I can say it was so quite, & peaceful there. I could almost feel his presence. My son now 19, his birthday was the day before, followed me as we walked the shoreline, I spoke of earlier & much happier times before he was born. I walked up to the old rusted bar b que that was used till his death I ak sure, bottles were still sitting on the side of it, I opened the bar b que like an idiot (not thinking, LOL) I was met with three huge nest, I think the surprise was on us as well, because they all turned to look at me, Chills run along my skin as I speak of this, I let that lid slam shut as fast as gravity would allow, I remember the nest going stark with as they left the nest, without missing a beat I turned ran almost into my sons face, he needed no proding whatsoever, he had seen the horror on my face as well as the sight under that lid. I heard the slap of the lid slamming down know full well those nest came loode and hit the grills, lol, retribution would be swift!\nTime seemed to slow down as we turned and ran as fast as humanly possible, our legs felt like they weighed a hundred pounds each and with each step the weight just increased. I was expecting multiple stings at any moment, after what seemed an eternity, my son and I had ran approximately twenty yards, turned and took the liberty of looking over our shoulders just a tad, still keeping pace as we did so, alarmed to see many red figures approaching fast and furiously, almost within striking distance, our skin crawled ( we later recounted this to each other) we continued our rampage the hell out of the area, dafe and sound, I think we had ran a total of a hundred yards by the time we took another look. I am not sure when they stopped chasing us but there were some flying around the area. I believe they can smell fear, I know we smelled horribly of it.\nWe watchedthe area of the Bar b que from a safe distance, it was teaming with them, as we had to walk about 30 yards from them to get back to the main road out. I can say for sure we were lucky, had I not dropped that lid I think this story would not have been spoken of so lightly. I was so shocked to see so many of them on almost every structure, and even the old outhouse was occupied by them, these pest were dominating the area where not even yellow jackets were seen, there are several other cabins there, an old barn/storeage shed. Each had red wasps nest under or inside. It was almost 2 pm, and getting late, I felt like an alien intruder, as these wasp kept us from approaching any structure whatsoever. They would take flight @ us if we got closer than twenty feet. I am not exaggerating one bit. I remember way back when we used to swim there, fish there, and have tons of fun. These were times when his pappy was there each weekend, and Larry all but lived there, there were always wasps yellow jackets and the such which had to be taken care of , the upkeep on the property was meticulous, & it showed, and were enjoyed immensely by everyone that came out. Time passed as well as his pappy, then him mother god rest her soul too. His father told me when I spoke to him that he just could not bare to go out there anymore since Larry\u2019s passing, never touched it since the day larry left for town and never made it back, his boots were still sitting where he had taken them off, expecting to gather them upon his return. I suppose that we never think we might not be coming back. However as I walked out of the property, I turned and looked back at how beautifull it all was, and from that distance, the sun shining off the surface of the lake, all the trees, the winding road, I felt like I was ran off, a trespasser on my friends property. I returned to my fathers place a few miles down the road. We all laughed about the experience and felt maybe we seemed to make too much of it all.\nI can tell you that as we all sat around talking, I said that as long as there is life, & people here, then it is inviting, and my father and my stepmother take great care of their property, and there are all kinds of wasps yellow jackets, that defend their areas, yet are kept in check by vigilantly evicting them when they make nest too close to the home of structures frequented by people, we have all been stung by many of these good pest, I agree they are not to be arbitrarily exterminated, but left alone if possible.\nMost are just doing GODS work. This long story was to give you the same feeling as we encountered, and to also show that most black wasp, and yellow jackets will protect thier nest when it is endangered, but in the case of the RED WASP they are extremely aggressive when you apprach their nest. We laugh that is the cause of their almost floresent red color, a warning DON\u2019T tread here!\nDear NoBoDee,\nThanks for sharing your first hand experience with Red Wasps.\nThese red wasps are MUCH more aggressive than the black ones!!!  My husband was bitten yesterday, as was our neighbor and myself\u2026and the bites DO hurt!  Our hands swelled up, turned red and warm, and were very painful\u2026fortunately, those were the only affects we noticed from the bites.  I was standing on the deck working with some flower boxes and this one came over to me and attacked\u2026I didn\u2019t even know it was there, nor was I bothering it at all!!  It was stuck in my hand \u2013 stinging me \u2013 for about 5-8 seconds, and I had a very hard time shaking it off.  And, as I said before, the bite does hurt!!  We then noticed about 4 or 5 of them \u2013 all hovering around the deck posts and eaves on the front porch where there was a small hole that they were coming in and out of.  Needless to say, when the weather gets cooler we will be filling in that hole!\nI just want to come out and say that, having been stung FOUR TIMES within a two week time span by the same nest of red wasps (apparently they are also immune to RAID, as the nest has survived two entire cans worth), I disagree with a number of points from the original response.  First off I want to start with a bit of background.  I am terrified of spiders, if I even think there is one on me I will completely freak out.  However if I witness another person killing a spider, when they could have completely ignored it and never seen it again, I will berate them for their actions.  So I\u2019m not an adamant \u201ckill all creepy bugs\u201d guy.  But the wasp situation I\u2019m in now is getting out of hand.  I can\u2019t even leave my house without being flown at.  I have to wrap myself from head to toe in a blanket, or risk a FIFTH sting THIS SUMMER.  As I have said I have tried ignoring them, poisoning them, trapping them, even throwing shoes at them from afar (took out three that way).  The most recent scare I had was when I came home from work today (8/12/10) and there were a grand total of 11 wasps buzzing around the windows, and air conditioner, of my modest one room apartment.  Needless to say, a third can of raid has been emptied in the ongoing war against this SAME NEST.  That being said, I have noticed that, for whatever waspy reason, I am the only one targeted by their hostility.  Friends and family have come over, during the day and night, at times quietly, others banging loudly on the door (above which, somewhere in the eaves, lies the nest) and have not been stung.  I however can\u2019t even approach my front porch without being swarmed at.  I have to carry a blanket with me every day to work, so that I can hide under it while I try to sprint through my door.  But I\u2019m a long winded fool so I\u2019ll wrap up on this point: I don\u2019t know what wasp you\u2019re referring to when you say it\u2019s a peaceful species, but it\u2019s not the one displayed in the picture above, which is identical to whatever is living above my door.\nI \u201cfound\u201d a red wasp in my bed one night a few weeks ago.  The sting was the worst.  It felt like my leg had been set on fire.  It turned red, swelled up and burned for days.  I have found one other in my house, but I check for them very diligently, inside and outside. I really don\u2019t want to encounter another.  I have small grandchildren and worry that they may get stung by one of these vicious bugs.\nI have been attacked and bitten serveral times by these large red wasps.  Their color is more orange than red.  We reside in SW Tennessee in a rural area.  The local Home Depot was total sold out of wasp spray.  The gentleman in the department said he had never known a time when they were sold out of wasp spray.  He said he had a problem at his home as well.  Later I met another gentlemen who was also shopping for spray.  He had a 3 year old at home and the nest was just outside the window of his daughter.  We have always had a policy of leave them alone and they will leave us alone.  NOT, in the case of these insects.  I have been attacked 2 times from behind when just in the drive way.  Apparently they don\u2019t like a car running near their abode.  They congregate around corners of the house where they apparantely get into the attics under the roof overhang.  Their sting is extremely painful and lasts several days.  The stings is very painful as well create itching over a large area surrounding the sting.  One sting was on the top of my ear and the whole side of my face was in agony for several days.  I finally declared war on these bothersome creatures and have gone through over $50 dollars of spray.  Some work better than others.  Several insects fly away even after being sprayed.  I have never known an insect as aggressive as these other than hornets.\nThese red wasps have been really bad this year here in Texas hill country near Austin.  They seem to like the eaves and bushes by our front door and picture window the best.  I\u2019ve gone through two cans of spray so far.  Never had them before this year, at least not in these numbers.  Like others have said, our local Home Depot is often sold out of wasp spray because there have been so many people experiencing infestations.  I\u2019ve not been stung yet, but it\u2019s not for their lack of trying.  They are aggressive, yes sir, they sure are.\nI am sorry to disagree with you ,buit these wasp are very aggresive if you get close totheir nest.Aand i mean with in 10 to 20 feet especialy when their young are present .and the kind withthe yellow face are even worse,yes do somthing about them.\nThis is my second time to attempt a post here.  When my first never appeared, I assumed it was because I violated the party line of \u201cleave them alone and they will leave you alone\u201d.  Some wasps may, but NOT the ones I, and apparently others, are discussing here.  I inherited a farmhouse in western Kentucky that is not currently occupied.  There are several fruit trees (apple, pear, etc.) on the property which I believe are contributing to our wasp infestation.  A very large, very red/orange, VERY aggressive type of wasp has basically overrun the place.  While NO nests are visible anywhere, the wasps enter and exit multiple places in the house and detached garage via barely visible cracks and holes.  In some places they use smooth holes that appear to have been \u201cdrilled\u201d in the mortar between bricks, although I can\u2019t imagine how.  When I say large, I mean between 1 and \u00bc and 1 and \u00bd inches long.  These are at least a quarter larger than \u201cregular\u201d wasps.  By aggressive, I mean that if they see you, they come at you until you kill them.  We have gone through dozens of cans of the spray that fires a solid stream.  Normal wasps hit with this drop immediately and soon die.  These just get up and fly back at you, until you knock them down with a steady stream for a third and occasionally fourth time.  On one visit late last summer, we were unable to even get out of the car.  There were several HUNDRED of them in the air, not swarming, just doing whatever wasps do (a LOT of it).  One would hit a car window with an audible noise every 2-3 seconds.  We had to turn around and leave.  Over the winter I sprayed poison and foam sealant into every crack and hole I could find.  I set off multiple bug bombs inside each structure, although they seem to be in the walls and rarely if ever inside.  I visited last week, and there were 30-40 of them around.  I couldn\u2019t even mow because noise seems to make them even madder and draw them from a distance.  I killed what I could, but it was obviously a losing battle as they have apparently found (or made) new cracks and holes.  My last recourse is to hire a professional exterminator, but I am very dubious as to how successful this will be.  I contacted the largest exterminator in the area and got the \u201coh it\u2019s just wasps\u2026 we\u2019ll spray them and knock the nests down if you can\u2019t\u201d.  When I said there were no visible nests and suggested this was something new to my area and more aggressive, I was basically laughed at.\nDear FoolKiller,\nWe generally approve all comments we receive, except for items that are SPAM or otherwise inappropriate.  Though we believe in tolerance with insects, many folks who write to us do not share that world view, but we do not censor content that differs from our own stance.  We have gotten numerous reports of aggressive Red Wasps and we no longer write that they are harmless.  Most Paper Wasps can sting, and they will defend the nest from danger.  Approaching the nest, or trying to remove the nest will most assuredly result in the potential for being stung.  It seems this is most evident with the Red Wasps.  Thanks for supplying your comment.\n[...] and their wings are as black as their hearts (picture below). According to a website called \u201cWhat\u2019s That Bug?\u201d red wasps are known for their non-aggressiveness. Oh wait, except they are aggressive, [...]\nHello, I just moved into a home in Plano, TX with some kind of red wasps flying all around the patio.  I would like to get rid of the nest but I can\u2019t find it.  Can you give some tips on locating the nest? \u2013 I have looked all around under the eaves and have tried watching where they go but no luck so far.  At what time of day would I be most likely to see them going in and out?  Thank you.\nwell i have been ignoring these pests until yesterday when i \u201cbumped\u201d into one and only knew it stung me by the swelling, not so bad. then one stung my elderly mother, and this morning, just passing by the area on her stairs where they seem to congregate, i was stung 5 times without even paying them any attention. in my experieince they get more and more aggressive as thweir numbers increase. i have a high tolerance for bugs, hate to kill them most of the time but these guys are right little buggers and if i\u2019m going to get stung just coming and going to my moms they are gonna get sprayed. i agree with earlier comments that something must be up. we\u2019ve seen one or two around for years but they never bothered us, heck i helped a couple get freedom outside when they wandered into my moms apt but these guys are aggressively hostile and i\u2019m not taking chances with an 81 year old woman.\n@kblank \u2013 They tend to move around in the heat of the day. The places I\u2019ve typically seen them in are eaves and inside attics. However, if you have a patio that is above the ground, they may be under that.\nI had the unfortunate pleasure of sitting on the edge of an above ground pool which was also home to a hive. Yes, they got me where you would expect.\nIn my experience with them, they are only aggressive when you are near a spot which MAY hold a nest. They might be thinking of building there or there might be one you don\u2019t see.\nBut when they are just fluttering about on the grass, they never seem to mind me.\nYes I have been around wasps all my life and not been not only stung but chased and attacked by  red wasps.  They don\u2019t like being disturbed. when i mow grass they will chase me out of the area.\nThey burn worse than a tetanus shot and much worse than a black wasp. I learned to put ice pack on a sting as fast as possible. That seemed to stop the burning in a mater of a few minutes.\nOne more note I had been stung twice mowing my yard but on the third ( and after) time they just batted me on the head. But they did investigate my lawn mower for several minutes.\nI have also mud wasps that are tolerant of my moving about the garage\nOH! Anrkist\nI honestly have to agree with the original sentiment.  In doing lots of landscape work in Texas (Austin and Dallas) for the past several years, red wasps have been an almost a daily encounter.  I\u2019ve never thought of them as aggressive.  I encounter these guys 10x as frequently as any other wasp except cicada killers, and have never been stung, whereas yellowjackets have gotten me half a dozen times.   Especially right now, with the drought, they seem drawn towards areas with moisture, and I\u2019ve almost grabbed one of them or stepped on one more times than I can count when changing hoses, turning on faucets, etc.  They seem to be quite curious when I enter an area they\u2019re in, and will circle around and sometimes buzz me, but I keep my cool (e.g. I don\u2019t start flapping my arms, swatting at them) and they totally leave me alone.  I can\u2019t say a thing about how they behave when their nest is approached, because in all this time, working on acres and acres of different properties, I\u2019ve never encountered a nest: not in abandoned sheds, eaves of the home\u2013nowhere.  I\u2019ve always been mystified as to where their nests might be, so I\u2019m believing the original post which said they live in *very* sheltered locations.  Completely, totally surprised to come here and find everyone posting about how horrible these things are.  They seem as benign as cicada killers.  I\u2019d trade all the damn yellow jackets in the world for more of these guys.\nDear cyker,\nThank you so much for your valuable perspective.  As a landscaper, it stands to reason that you would have had ample opportunity to be stung by Red Wasps if they were an aggressive species.  Perhaps like beauty, aggression is in the eye of the beholder.\nI may have posted something on reds before.  I agree with all the reports of extreme aggression, and medieval, excruciating pain from a single sting.  I was chased out of my yard by 1 red after running at it with a mower, neither the noise, vibration nor the machine intimidated it.  It showed distinct reasoning intelligence in flying up over the mower straight towards my face.  I was across the street in seconds, and the red claimed the yard!  When I was 6 or 7, I took one sting from a red and could not stop screaming till 7 hours passed, baking soda etc. was applied.  One strange experience stands out.  In 1987 I hit a clothes line pole (hollow T-shape, round parts) with a mower.  Immediately I saw five reds, very angry, hovering quite close to my face.  In the span of 1 second I had 2 thoughts, first, \u201cI\u2019ve had it\u201d and second, is there a way out?  I don\u2019t think I could have outrun them short distance and they were less than a foot from my face in tight formation.  Make of this what you will, but without moving, I yelled \u201cNO!\u201d and somehow, against all reason, was able to back away without a sting.  The mower was off as it was a safety bar type machine, I had released it as soon as I hit the pole, or as soon as I saw the flying terrors.  Can they understand \u201cNO!\u201d ?  I believe what they heard was \u201cattitude,\u201d if you think they won\u2019t sting, they may not.  However I doubt this will work if you intentionally put it to a test, it may work only in an emergency, and that may have been the only \u201creprieve\u201d I was to ever get!\nHi Charles,\nYour experience with Red Wasps is a priceless addition to our site.\nI grew up in Houston, and one of my earliest memories was being stung numerous times around my lip by red wasps when I was two. I was just out in the back yard, near a bush, when they attacked. I still remember the pain, and I was sick for a week. I remember this so vividly. I couldn\u2019t go to a neighbor kid\u2019s birthday party because I was still sick, but I remember someone walking over with a piece of birthday cake for me. We knew to be wary of any wasp, but especially the red one, after that. I\u2019ve been somewhat allergic to wasps and bees ever since. If I get stung once in a great while, it\u2019s not so bad. But if I get stung a couple times a year, for instance, I swell up for over a week. I respect life, and never kill anything without a reason, and I find insects fascinating. But I live in N. California now, and sure don\u2019t miss the red wasps.\nThank you for your firsthand account.\nDont know where my lengthy message went but just want to say they are very aggressive and sting\u2019S hurt much more than honey bee stings.\nOH, KILL ALL RED WASPS!\nHey i\u2019m not sure if people are still reading this but i live in north alabama and i got alot of this lil pests and i mean alot oncecounted a good 17 from a nest i killed and a good 20+ just on the wall of my place and seems like there are alot more i\u2019ve seen them post at the doors and just watch them looked outside once and saw one watching me and the door a hour later it was in the same spot i have not yet been stung but i don\u2019t feel to safe with 10+ watching me when i take my dogs out but as a plus if you got a way to get some bumble bees to live near your place they will help you fight off the wasps and unless you mess with them they will leave you alone the reason i say this is because when i was fighting off wasps with spary a bumble bee showed up and started helping me get rid of them yet it never once tried to sting or even rush at me like it did the wasps well i\u2019ve posted alot and should stop but if you know a way i can get some bumble bees to live near my place i\u2019ed like to know and sorry for the long post.\nWe suspect the insect you saw may have been one of the Robber Flies known as Bee Killers (see Featured Creatures) that mimics bumble bees since the Robber Flies prey upon bees and wasps.\nIm having the same problem in my home! I was cooking dinner last night and i look up to see a BIG red wasp crawling on one of my pots so i immediately ran away. My husband then killed it and several minutes later a couple more seemed to have come from under where the lightbulb is over my kitchen sink, as though they were protecting their home or warning us to stay away. If we even approached them they would immediately raise their wings and start \u201cbuzzing\u201d. So i went to cvs and bought raid wasp and hornet killer and it immediatly killed them on contact. But now i have about 5 or 6 flying about my house as i type\u2026..-____- what can i do to get rid of them?!? i have a one year old son and i am very worried about him getting stung! please help!\nWe do not provide extermination advice.\nihateredwasps first thing you should do is get some fly swatters and smack them in the air if you gotta then call the a bug man sure helped me out i can now go outside freely with no worry of wasps and bugman that thing looks nothing like a bumble bee besides the fact it is black and yellow.\nAre these red wasps common all over?  I am on Long Island, and the other night while giving my kids a bath I saw what I am guessing was one of these in my bathroom.  My daughter saw it and freaked out.  It wasnt very aggressive.  I do have a carpenter bee problem, and have had an exterminator spray for those all last summer, and I think so far once this spring as well.  I did not initially think it was a wasp because of the color, I always thought wasps were only black and yellow.  This was also much large than the common wasps I see in my area.  Would spray from an exterminator that is meant for carpenter bees also kill these?\nMembers in the genus Polistes are found throughout North America.  We do not give extermination advice.\nOh yeah, aggressive!  Don\u2019t be mistaken!  I had a colony around my house just recently.  Clusters of them clinging to my front porch lamp, some coming down my chimney (four got in, four died in the stove when I discovered where they were getting in at).   They dive bombed me every time I went out the door.  I finally found their main \u201chang out\u201d on the base of a nearby oak.  At least 20 of them.  Wasp spray took them out and I think round one is won for this year.  But I expect more.   If they\u2019re supposed to be \u201cnon-aggressive\u201d I guess the ones around here have been \u201cAfricanized\u201d (that\u2019s a joke, btw).\nI don\u2019t feel I have much to add to these comments, but to say that for their aggressive behavior, the red wasp is not \u2018evil\u2019 and is very much an important part of the ecosystem.  I too have been attacked multiple times for no apparent reason here in Jonesboro, Arkansas.  The first time I had a negative encounter with these wasps it was entirely because of a human error.  My father swatted one away with his hand as I was walking out the door and it took it\u2019s agression out on me with a sting to the upper arm, 5 on my ankle, and a nasty welt from the dragging of the stinger across the top of my foot.  Before that incident I had no abnormal fear of wasps, and though it really got my adrenaline going to see them after that, I tried to maintain that it was our own error that resulted in the attack.  However, in the years since that incident, red wasp behavior has become significantly more hostile.  Something has made them more agressive, and I do think it is the result of the human footprint all the way (though this may not necessarily be alterable).  Bottom line, though I would not consider them to be safer hanging around outside my doors and windows, I don\u2019t mind them on the property, they have every right.\nOn an interesting note, and I may just be seeing a behavior that isn\u2019t really there, they do give you a warning if they decide to attack while seated at the nest or on any surface they may be clinging to.  The wings point forward slightly toward and rather than look relaxed they seem to poise their entire body to lauch in your general direction.  Hahaha.\nThanks Heather.  We really appreciate your firsthand experience with Red Wasps.\nSame behavior here as well, about an hour away from Little Rock, AR.\nWe moved here and I\u2019ve been trying to figure out what type they were for a while, since at some point the home had mud daubers as well (found old mud dauber nests, and the red wasps that took their place when we renovated one of our bathrooms).\nHalf the time they\u2019ll go about their business, it seems like they fly directly by me intentionally on their way, go around me once or twice and leave. They do leave guards out, and the other posted who said about their poised getting ready to attack position, I definitely agree with that. If I walk by their area, I wouldn\u2019t even say nest, at least 10 foot away, 10 feet up, they\u2019ll chase you away, haven\u2019t been stung yet though. I do want them gone, unfortuntly their nest is hidden behind my siding, with their entrance at the top, they access through the flashing there. Can\u2019t get to them w/o removing my siding.. can\u2019t remove my siding cause they mean business    So I have two sides of my home they\u2019ve taken over, and now I built a covered porch in the middle, far away from both sides, and they like to hang out there too.\nWe have a red wasp nest up inside a small roof area on a bay window.  Last year there were only about 1/2 dozen wasps and they weren\u2019t aggressive, so we didn\u2019t take any steps and were going to seal off the area during the winter.  Didn\u2019t get it done, so this year, they\u2019ve multiplied tremendously and while not terribly aggressive, there are a lot and they are more aggressive than before. So today we\u2019ve been spraying them while they\u2019re outside sunning themselves since we can\u2019t get inside the nest.  We\u2019ll continue to do this until they get tired of it and leave or until winter comes again and we can seal it off.  They are near high traffic areas on the deck and back yard with children playing all the time, not to mention outdoor grilling.  I\u2019m also very allergic to stings.  While they are certainly not as agressive as the mud wasps we had in California, some hives are agressive and I used to have one where they always tried to attack my windshield whenever I drove in the yard.  They lost.  Fortunately, they weren\u2019t as agressive with people.  I generally leave bugs alone that have enough sense to stay outside, but stinging bugs close to the house or venomous spinders such as black widows and brown recluse need to make way for the humans, especially since we have young ones.  Otherwise, if they aren\u2019t threatening me or mine, they can live in peace.\nIt\u2019s been almost 3 years since my first post about these wasps. Since then I moved to a different house trying to avoid them\u2026. I will be moving up north to maine soon and these are a contributing factor. I have avoided stings for a couple years by sheer vigilance. My wife tells me there are three of these in our new house right now and as I am at work I can not help her\u2026. I\u2019m sick of this. I kill every one of these I see now and I go out of my way to kill them. I cant even be outside or have a window open without seeing one every 5 minutes. Oklahoma is infested with these. These wasps are tough as nails too, I have been outside working on a spraypaint project and been flown at, chased, and when I sprayed the wasp it didn\u2019t even bother it all I did was color it white (I was using white paint). I have spent so much money on wasp spray, sprayed nests and holes where they live in futility, they always come back. Recently I noticed spray de-icer (mostly compressed ethylene glycol, isopropanol, and methanol will knock them out of the air and stun them for five minutes\u2026. go ahead and step on em or they will get back up after a few minutes of laying on their back kicking their legs. Black canned raid hornet and wasp killer is about the only thing I know of that kills them on contact but its not instant\u2026. WD40 kills them eventually but the spray isn\u2019t the best. Its just whatever I have had available to kill them with at the time. I only use the Raid when I find a nest but then the next day there will be more. I hate hate hate these things!\ni have seen these wasp outside sometimes but we have  only had 1 or two get into the house.we have seen alot of them out by our bushes in swuanee georgia but i have yet to be stung and you are talking to a  man who is freaked out by wasps or bees.I think we may have a nest but i am not sure near these bushes and i am not going to hang around to find out.I have seen them numerous at cdc too as i am walking about the campus.I have seen them espically but  the dumpuster i think the like trash. I have yet like i said be stung by them but i do belive they are more agressivee.oh FYI they are also called maghongy wasps and they do see alot in our area.\nhope this helps\nThank you for the information.  We like the regional name Mahogany Wasp.\nI\u2019m in Austin and we had a red wasp nest under the stairs leading up to my apartment. These are VERY AGGRESSIVE wasps. They would chase me hundreds of feet away from the nest, they are NOT afraid of anyone or anything, and they are relentless. My girlfriend was walking up the stairs and was attacked and stung twice and she had to physically remove the wasp FROM her body because it was not going to stop.\nThe nest was sprayed by maintenance, but not removed. Two days later, the wasps were rebuilding the nest. I have to hand it to them for their fortitude\u2026..I\u2019ve never encountered such an aggressive species that seems to ENJOY attacking. And I\u2019ve lived in Texas all my life.\nI have been reading the comments above, and if I may, I\u2019d like to add to the discussion.  I live in a rural area about 40 miles north of Houston.  I\u2019m 51, and have lived here almost my entire life so I am familiar with red wasps and the other paper wasps in this area.  The other species are fairly easy-going, but the red wasp is different.   I don\u2019t know if I would describe them as aggressive- maybe hyper-defensive would be a better term.  Think about it, wasps build nests for the purpose of raising their young, and if you have a flimsy paper nest full of nice juicy grubs that almost every critter for miles around would love to eat you had better be able and willing to defend it or your species won\u2019t last long.   We humans don\u2019t like it, but that defensiveness is a positive attribute from the wasp\u2019s perspective.  We seem to have more red wasps in this area than any other species of paper wasp, and their hyper-defensive nature may be the reason for this. \nThey have their place in the ecosystem and they were here  before us, so I am willing to try to live with them.   I let them live under my eaves and inside my soffits and haven\u2019t had any problems ( we have shrubs under the eaves so I don\u2019t have to mow closer then about 8 feet from the house), but I can\u2019t let them live on my porches.  I have shared the porches with other species of paper wasp with no problems at all, but the reds are just too high-strung for that kind of close contact with people.  \nAs others have noticed  red wasps do like to build their nests in more sheltered and protected areas, which is consistent with their more defensive nature.  They would rather live inside your soffits (usually nor more than a foot inside) than out in the open under the eaves.   So I suspect that when people report \u201cunprovoked\u201d attacks they were really near a nest without knowing it.  The only clue you will have is the presence of guard wasps at the entrance point to the nest.  If you see some red wasps (sometimes as many as a dozen) just hanging out for no apparent reason in a particular area they are probably guarding the entrance to a nest.  When they raise their wings they are getting agitated so keep your arms down and back away slowly.   I do agree with some others who have noticed that a colony of reds will be more easily agitated as their numbers increase, usually later in the summer.  \nI agree that wasps (all species) will only try to sting if they feel their nest is being threatened.  They don\u2019t wake up every morning with the goal of trying to attack as many people as possible that day.  That said, if you want to avoid problems it is important that you be aware of what\u2019s going around your house and property, especially any structures.   Paper wasps commence nest building in the Spring, and then again in late July/early August, so if they are trying to build in an unsuitable place that\u2019s the time to control them if it\u2019s absolutely necessary.   Some folks have said that insect poison in a can won\u2019t kill red wasps, but I have never seen it fail.  It may not drop them immediately, but it does work, at least in my experience.  I absolutely hate using poison spray, so a pellet gun is my weapon of choice when the deed must be done (be careful).  \nOne last comment-  some of the folks in this discussion have mentioned that they have noticed the red wasps in their area getting more defensive in recent years.  I can only say that in my part of the country the reds have been easily agitated and different from the other wasps for as long as I can remember.   For the last 47 years or so they haven\u2019t changed a bit.  \nThat\u2019s it.  It\u2019s probably obvious that I\u2019m a  big insect lover (especially all kinds of wasps), so I could probably write a small book on my observations over the years.  I\u2019m also a huge fan of What\u2019s That Bug.  You folks do great work.  All the best!\nWow, thanks so much for the informed comment Karl.  We have been away from the office for several weeks and that is why it has taken us so long to respond and approve your comment.\nI live north of Austin (Killeen area in the country) Grew up around cicada killers and hornets, but have never seen anything as aggressive as these \u201cred wasps\u201d I got stung walking by a nest two days ago on the back of my hand. My hand is so swollen I cannot close it, wear my wedding ring, or a watch. This was my 5th or 6th sting in the last 3 years. I usually have been stung on the neck or head, but the sting on the hand was the worst. We live in the country with Austin Stone walls. They find any crevice they can to nest. I am developing a real \u201cdislike\u201d for these buggers!!\nOkay, I am from near Little Rock.  Maybe the accounts given by these folks are of a red hornet.\nWe have some sort of highly aggressive red flying devil around here that will come out of nowhere and swoop down when we try to get in our front door or when we let our dog out the back door to potty.  If you even stand in front of the back door, one will magically appear at the door and hover, waiting for you.  We have checked the eaves around the doors and there are no active nests in the area for them to guard.  The only nest in the area is one from another species of paper wasp.\nLooking closely at the pictures, however\u2026this devil and the other red paper wasp don\u2019t really look like our evil red devils.  Ours are red and have lighter legs.  They are fat and appear to have a tiny bit of fluff to them.  They are mostly immune to even the strongest wasp sprays (my no-kill policy goes out the door when something threatens me and my family).  I thought it might be a male cow killer, as I have encountered the female many times.  It looks nothing like the pics of male cow killers, either.  The legs do dangle when they fly, so I don\u2019t think they are hornets despite their size.  I don\u2019t know what the heck we have, but now I want to try to snap a photo\u2026\nI have lived in east Texas my whole life and never seen a meaner insect than the red wasp!  We have them badly at our house, and I can never get rid of them. Usually a squirt of Raid Wasp and Hornet spray will knock the little suckers on their heads. But, now they seem to be laughing at me when I use it! I literally have to drown them in the spray for it to finally kill them.  Can they become immune to the spray?? I have never had any problems using that spray.\nWhile there is some evidence that insects like Cockroaches can develop a tolerance to insecticides, we do not think that is the case with the Red Wasps.  The nest will have a queen and sterile workers.  The workers are most likely doing the attacking.  Since they do not pass down genetic material, they are most likely not developing a tolerance to your sprays.\nThanks for the response!\nI\u2019m not really saying anything that hasn\u2019t already been said but just wanted to throw my comment in. I also have lived in east Texas (Jasper) all my life and am very familiar with the \u201cred wasp\u201d. I do agree that they seem to be very aggressive when you are around their nest but I do see them in the  yard when mowing and just out and about and they don\u2019t seem to care much about me. There seems to be two kind of what I call the \u201cred wasp\u201d. One species is the one that is solid red or \u201corange\u201d and the other is the same color except for their tail, which is black. Both seem to be the same except for that. I have only been stung one time by one of these while I was weed eating near a raised deck. That sucker popped me on my forehead and it felt like I had been hit with a baseball bat. lol  So, I do get rid of any nest I see around my house. I have found that most all of the spray that you buy seems to work well. Just wanted to my two cents in\u2026..thanks.\nI live in Mississippi and am now 63 years old. I have always gone by the rule that leave wasps alone and they will leave you alone. I am outdoors all the time and have not been stung in years. However over the last two weeks I have  witnessed someone attacked just for walking within 6-8 feet of a hidden nest and today my small dog was stung in a similar manner. These are Large orange \u2013 red wasps, with paper nests. They are very very aggressive!\nI am a vinyl siding and window replacement guy. Needless to say wasps and their cousins are an every day part of my job during warm parts of the year.\n I constantly remind my employees, don\u2019t bother them and they won\u2019t bother you. Something has drastically changed over this past warm season. These big orange/red wasps are popping up everywhere and their aggression is unlike anything I have ever experienced before.  I have come across this type of wasp plenty of times in the past, but something is different. If you even go on the same side of the house where these wasps are nesting (and their nests are very well hidden inside the cornice) they attack. When they hit you, they grasp onto you like a thorn and you have to knock them off. \n They are no longer passive wasps, they are the most aggressive I have ever encountered. They make hornets seem passive.\nThey are also very poison resistant. The spray that will drop a regular wasp to the ground with a mist will take multiple cans to take out a nest of these particular wasp. Unfortunately, that seems the only way to deal with them. They will not simply leave you alone if you leave them alone.\nIt\u2019s disconcerting when something that has never seemed to be aggressive before, suddenly changes and becomes a menace.  I say suddenly because until this summer, I have co-existed quite well with these red wasps.  I know they have their place, and never minded sharing my area with them.  Something has changed.  I do hope someone is researching this.  At any rate, I live in rural northeastern Arkansas.  For the first time I am being attacked.  When you walk on your deck and a big red wasp flies straight for you and stings you in the face, just under your eye, you take notice.  Ouch\u2026painful.  I have had these wasps build nests all around my house for years without a problem.  I\u2019ve gotten close often.  They have never seemed to notice me.  Until this year.  I\u2019m just glad it isn\u2019t my favorite garden/yard beastie who is doing this.  I LOVE my bumblebees!\nHi LInda,\nWe are documenting this in all the approved comments we have accepted, however as busy college professors, we don\u2019t have time to research it at this moment.  We will try to learn who is the premier Polistes authority in North America and try to get his opinion.\nThis is a tip I\u2019ve used my entire adult life, as I\u2019m allergic to bee stings.  Purchase a cheap can of hair spray (the aerosol ones like Aqua Net are no longer available, which is a bummer as their spray was the strongest).  Test it in the store if need be, but make sure it sprays as forcefully as possible.   You can then use the hair spray to spray any flying insect.  If you hit it liberally with the spray, within a few seconds its wings stiffen/seize up and it can no longer fly.  You will see it walking around trying to fly.  That\u2019s when you can safely kill it with a newspaper roll or fly swatter.  Plus I figure the hair spray is not as toxic as insect killer (don\u2019t know if I\u2019m right about that, but I am supposing since you are supposed to be able to spray it on humans).  Good luck to all; I am TERRIFIED of bees/wasps/hornets.\nThis is our 2nd or 3rd year of having those wasps. We live near Memphis tn. You can see them sitting on the house looking at you. then they attack.  They are called Mahogany  Wasps.  Look them up, same ones!\nI am having the same problem in Memphis, TN.  I have seen a very aggressive strain of red-wasps emerge.  Their nest is in my carport attic and have had little trouble in the past, but this blast of warm air has brought them all out.  I have seen a mixture of what I would consider red wasps and a mixture of red-wasp/hornet (their tails are orangish red with black stripes) congregating in the same hole.  I\u2019m not sure about the species, but these suckers are way bigger than normal red wasps.  I have sat in deer stands with red wasps buzzing around and have never had a problem.  I consider it rather strange as I have never seen this type of behavior in the past.  Active attacks are just plain odd.\nIf the Queen was on the move, could that explain the behavior?\nThe queen does not leave the nest, but rather dies with the hive at the end of the season with the rest of her colony.  New queens leaving the nest might explain additional activity.  New queens will leave the nest in autumn.  They will mate and seek a place to hibernate over the winter, and they will begin a nest of their own the following spring.\nAs I replied further up the thread, these are not hornets. They are mean and aggressive. They destroy hornet nests, as apparently the 2 species don\u2019t get along well.  They build diamond shaped nests in places that are difficult to see and get to. They can survive normal wasp sprays, I\u2019ve seen them get up and fly away after being knocked down by the spray. Personally, I use the cap to squash them. In summertime, I usually carry a tennis racket on the porch.\nTheir size is normally 1 \u2013 1.5\u2033, but I have seen them as big as 2.5\u2033.  And they hurt, bad.\nI just bought property around Elkhart, Texas.  I  had a mini excavator and cleared some land for a building and tore down an old mobile home frame.  I noticed a large amount of reddish/orange wasp or hornets flying around.  At first they were not aggressive to me but as the project progressed, they began to get extremely aggressive.  They began dive-bombing the excavator arm and bucket while I was digging holes in the ground.  The unit was diesel powered and I had a small amount of diesel on my hands so they didn\u2019t seem to be attracted to me until the next day after I had showered and not handled fuel again.  These were approx. 1-3/8\u2033 to 1.75\u2033 long and never changed their attitude back to the good and they would buzz me even when the machine was shut off overnight.  The machine was delivered back to the rental source after a week but still they won\u2019t leave me alone just walking around the property.  Also when I started my plate compactor they went nuts!  I was getting dive bombed by at least 10 of them until I shut it off.  I am going to be gone for a couple months and hopefully they will forget me by then.  If they are still aggressive at that time I\u2019ll do something about them.\nWe have gotten numerous reports of aggressive Red Wasps, especially from Texas.\nHello:\nI \u201cmet\u201d one of these wasps today; it landed right by me while I was outside working  on our deck. I was a little nervous at first  (thinking of angry wasps/yellow jackets) but I couldn\u2019t resist reaching for my phone to snap some shots since it was so close. I got some great macros that I posted on Instagram! The wasp never seemed overly perturbed by my presence. Occasionally it would drift off and then come back and sit for a bit.\nThis web site helped me identify it (thanks) and I saw the retraction about these wasps being aggressive and I just wanted to share that my experience was non-aggressive despite my putting a scary iPhone up close to it (haha). So just wanted to \u2018stick up for the bug\u2019 \u2013 I know you don\u2019t endorse terminating but just wanted to add my experience as well. Obviously folks with venom allergies is a whole \u2018nother concern.\nThank you for your comment.  We like being able to provide a balance of comments, both for and against.\nThanks for your reply too.  I don\u2019t like to \u201cmess\u201d with mother nature,  but if it \u201cmesses with me first I\u2019ll defend myself.  So far I haven\u2019t been stung but I sure thought I was going to be  nailed.  If someone came and wiped out my home I\u2019d be defensive too but I don\u2019t think I got his place in my work on the property.  Hopefully he\u2019ll forget me when I return in the fall.  I\u2019m very much against poisoning critters, but may have to resort to repellent plants etc.  There are a lot of plants they don\u2019t like that will keep them away but not hurt them that I would like to try first.  Hope yours stays passive.\nI n  Louisiana we are having  trouble  with large wasps , horse flys and red wasps.  Looking for suggestions.

You walk by them and they chase you.. I cant even count the number of times I have been stung..\nWe have these orange wasps in our overhang outside our house in Elmendorf, Texas. They are very aggressive. I have been stung a couple of times, my husband just once. But in his case, once was enough to send him(by ambulance) to hospital. He was stung on his head and immediately felt weak and short of breath. after getting him into house and giving benedryl his entire body began to tighten up and after about 10 minutes he could not move. All his muscles locked up! 911 was called and he even kinda blacked out due to blood pressure getting too high. It was the craziest thing I have ever seen. We now live with an epipen and he avoids them as much as possible. We are spraying them with wasp and hornet spray but by the next morning there are just as many back.  They are driving us crazy! lol\nI live 10 miles south of Little Rock, AR.  I have a colony of these large, red orange wasps take up in my siding cornice.  I cannot see the nest, only the crack wher ethey travel in and out from my flashing and roof frame.  Recently they have turned highly aggresive.  I have been stung twince, both on my head, without warning.  I will be calling an exterminator soon.\nI have two colonies living in my roofing.\nThey are not afraid to build near entryways, or doors.\nI smoke outside, and sit on my doorstep many times a day. They are really hard to ignore, so I watch them.\nThey do watch people closely, and will attack swiftly if threatened. Threatening, to them, is moving fast, causing any vibrations, just being close to them is risky.\nHere is an interesting observation. On days where it is very hot they sometime post outside their nest, fanning with their wings.\nThey do pack a vicious sting. While I haven\u2019t been stung, my landlord has.\nI grew up in NE Ark (Wynne) and these red wasps were horrible! They would attack my brothers and I as soon as we walked outside. I went to the bathroom at my church and one went up my skirt and stung me 13 times when I was a little girl. I moved to North Central Ark when I was grown and have ran into some of these aggressive red wasps but this year they haven\u2019t been bad. They float around the grass and go about their business. We\u2019ve only had to kill one nest around the swimming pool\u2026..I didn\u2019t want my children stung! So far so good this year! (I am allergic, so we have to kill the aggressive ones)  the rest can stay if they\u2019ll be good.\nYour email address will not be published.

When people think of wasps, they generally think of painful stings and swarms of buzzing pests.  Does the same apply to the paper wasp, and is the paper wasp a dangerous creature?\nScientifically speaking, paper wasps are members of the Polistinae family, but many people call yellow jackets and other hornet species paper wasps as well. Paper wasps are social insects that build nests out of plant fibers. The finished nests resemble brown paper, hence the name. The wasps build these nests in trees or under the roofs of houses to shelter them from rain.\nGenerally, paper wasps do not cause property damage.  Unlike termites, they do not harvest materials for their nests from artificial structures and do not cause damage to homes.  However, the nests can be unsightly, and many people remove them because of that.\nMost wasp infestations can be removed without the need of professional aid.  You can buy wasp killing sprays from several stores (or online).  Simply spray the nest, and wait until the wasps are dead; then remove the nest.  If there is a severe infestation, or if you are allergic (or don't wish to risk being stung), a professional exterminator can easily get rid of paper wasps.\nPaper wasps are not aggressive and only sting to defend their nests.  Their stings can be quite painful but are not lethal to humans - with one exception.  Certain individuals experience a lethal allergic reaction known as anaphylactic shock, which causes the airways to close. These individuals should seek medical attention immediately if stung.  Removal of paper wasp nests would also be a high priority for such people.\nPaper wasps are mainly pests.  Their nests are unattractive, and the tendency of the wasps to defend their territory can be annoying.  Only those individuals allergic to their stings are in severe danger; however, removal of paper wasp nests is a simple task, and these insects should not pose much of a problem.  In a worst case scenario, a professional exterminator can be called to deal with them.\n\nPlease login to add comments\n"], ["3 Ways to Identify Wasps - wikiHow", "http://www.wikihow.com/Identify-Wasps", "20 Editors\nThree Methods:ColorsBody featuresSize\nThe wasp family of insects includes thousands of species all around the world, most of which are predatory.

In some cases, it may be necessary to control paper wasps to minimize such risk.\nPaper wasps construct the familiar, open-celled paper nests we often see suspended from eaves or porch ceilings. Most species in North America belong to the genus Polistes. Paper wasps do serve an important ecological purpose as predators of other insects. They collect caterpillars, beetle larvae, and other insect prey to feed their young. \nEach year, the paper wasp queen must build a new nest, which she does by masticating wood fibers into a pliable pulp. Once she raises her first generation of workers, these offspring will assume the role of construction workers, expanding the nest to meet the needs of the growing colony. By summer, the paper wasp nest can be quite large, reaching a width of 6-8 inches. In fall, freezing temperatures will kill all but the queen, who seeks shelter and hibernates for the winter. The nest degrades over winter and is rarely reused the next year.\nAs with any insect, it's important to identify the insect before determining how and when control is necessary. Be sure you know the differences between wasps, yellowjackets, and hornets before taking action.\nPaper wasps can and will sting in defense of their nest, or when threatened. Unlike honeybees, which have barbed stings and can only sting once, paper wasps can sting multiple times. A paper wasp can call other colony members using alarm pheromones, chemical messages that tell other wasps to help defend the nest from a threat. Try to stay calm and avoid swatting at paper wasps. Follow my tips for avoiding bee stings.\nBefore you do anything to get rid of paper wasps around your home, ask yourself if you can tolerate their presence and leave them alone. Paper wasps help keep hungry caterpillars and other plant pests in check, benefiting your landscape and garden. If a paper wasp nest is located on your property but away from high use areas, consider leaving them alone. While they do sting, they only do so in response to a threat. Humans and paper wasps can often coexist peacefully. Obviously, when someone in your household has a wasp venom allergy, you may need to remove wasp nests to minimize the risk of an allergic reaction to a sting.\nIf a nest is located near an entrance to your home, or by a porch or deck where you spend a lot of time, you may need to take action to control paper wasps. Check eaves, shutters, and other high traffic areas in your yard early in the spring, when paper wasp queens are first building their nests. If you find a nest before the first generation of workers have reached adulthood, you can simply knock the nest down with a broom to discourage the queen from nesting in that location.\nLarger nests, or those found later in the season, should be handled cautiously. Never attempt to remove an active wasp nest during the day, when paper wasps are actively flying in and out of the nest. Wait until evening, when the wasps have settled in for the night, to treat or remove any paper wasp nest. During periods of cool weather, you may be able to treat wasp nests, as wasps become lethargic when temperatures dip down to 50\u00b0F or lower.\nThough I rarely recommend the use of chemical pesticides, the safest method of eradicating paper wasps in a problem area is, indeed, with a commercial wasp spray. Look for a product labeled for use on wasps and hornets, and remember, the label is the law. You must read the label and follow all directions for using any pesticide product. Wasp sprays usually come with a propellant that allows you to spray the pesticide from a safe distance. Coat the nest in the pesticide, making sure to cover all the cells of the paper wasp nest. Never stand below the wasp nest while applying the pesticide. Wasps may drop from the nest, and you also risk getting the chemical in your eyes or on your skin.\nBe sure to check the nest the next day for any signs of wasp activity. Before you remove a nest, you must be sure that no workers survived the pesticide application. Wasp sprays kill on contact. Wasps that were absent from the nest at the time you sprayed may return to the nest site. If you don't observe live wasps near the nest, use a broom or other long-handled tool to knock it down. Dispose of the nest properly. I recommend placing the nest in a sealed baggie and placing it in your household trash.\n Sources:\nAbout Education\u00a0Follow us:\n\n \n \n \n \n\nWe deliver.

Mud daubers, as they belong to different families, are variable in appearance, but most are long, slender wasps about 1-inch (25\u00a0mm) in length;.[1] The name refers to the nests that are made by the female wasps, which consist of mud molded into place by the wasp's mandibles. Mud daubers are not aggressive and stings are very uncommon.\n\n\nThe organ pipe mud dauber, one of many mud daubers in the family Crabronidae, as the name implies, builds nests in the shape of a cylindrical tube resembling an organ pipe or pan flute. Organ-pipe mud daubers build their very distinctive and elegant tubes on vertical or horizontal faces of walls, cliffs, bridges, overhangs and shelter caves or other structures.\nThe nest of the black and yellow mud dauber, one of many mud daubers in the family Sphecidae, is composed of a series of cylindrical cells that are plastered over to form a smooth nest about the size of a lemon. Black-and-yellow mud daubers build a simple, one-cell, urn-shaped nest that is attached to crevices, cracks and corners. Each nest contains one egg. Usually, they clump several nests together and plaster more mud over them.\nThe metallic-blue mud dauber, another sphecid, forgoes building a nest altogether and simply uses the abandoned nests of the other two species and preys primarily on spiders, including black widow spiders.[2] Blue mud daubers frequently appropriate old nests of black-and-yellow mud daubers. They carry water to them and recondition them for their own purposes. The two species commonly occupy the same barns, porches, or other nest sites.\nAll three species may occupy the same sites year after year, creating large numbers of nests. Mud dauber nests can last many years in protected locations and are often used as nest sites by other kinds of wasps and bees, as well as other types of insects.\nOne disadvantage to making nests is that most, if not all, of the nest-maker\u2019s offspring are concentrated in one place, making them highly vulnerable to predation. Once a predator finds a nest, it can plunder it cell by cell. A variety of parasitic wasps, ranging from extremely tiny chalcidoid wasps to larger, bright green chrysidid wasps attack mud dauber nests. They pirate provisions and offspring as food for their own offspring.\nLike most other wasps, mud daubers are predators. The females not only build the nests, but also they hunt to provision them. However, pipe-organ mud dauber males have reportedly brought spiders to the nest, and they aid in nest guarding.\nBlack and yellow mud daubers primarily prey on relatively small, colorful spiders, such as crab spiders (and related groups), orb weavers and some jumping spiders. They usually find them in and around vegetation. Blue mud daubers are the main predator of the black and brown widow spiders.\nAdults of both sexes frequently drink flower nectar, but they stock their nests with spiders, which serve as food for their offspring. Like connoisseurs, they prefer particular kinds of spiders, and particular sizes of spiders for their larders. Instead of stocking a nest cell with one or two large spiders, mud daubers cram as many as two dozen small spiders into a nest cell. They appear to know exactly what they are hunting for, and where to find it.\nPipe-organ mud daubers generally provision their nests with various kinds of orb weavers, but their diets includes other kinds of spiders, as well. Blue mud daubers prefer immature black widow spiders and their relatives. They hunt them in dry areas, such as outbuildings, rocky areas and stone piles.\nTo capture a spider, the wasp grabs it and stings it into submission.[citation needed] The venom from the sting does not kill the spider, but paralyzes and preserves it so it can be transported and stored in the nest cell until consumed by the larva. A mud dauber usually lays its egg on the prey item and then seals it into the nest cell with a mud cap.[1] It then builds another cell or nest. Missouri\u2019s mud daubers generally have two generations per year. The young survive the winter inside the nest.\nOn September 12, 1980, Florida Commuter Airlines flight 65 crashed en route to Freeport, Bahamas killing all 34 passengers and crew. The cause was determined to be due in part to a malfunctioning air speed indicator caused by mud dauber nests that were improperly cleared from the aircraft's pitot tubes.\nOn February 6, 1996, Birgenair Flight 301, a 757 jet flying from Puerto Plata in the Dominican Republic, crashed into the Atlantic Ocean. All 13 crew members and 176 passengers were killed. A key part of the accident was a blocked pitot tube, a component which measures outside air pressure through small tubes on the outside of the aircraft and displays this as the plane's speed. Although the tubes were never recovered from the ocean floor, it was discovered that the plane had been sitting on the tarmac for almost 3 weeks with the pitot tubes not covered as they should have been. Investigators believe a colony of black and yellow mud daubers got into the tube and built their cylindrical nests inside, causing faulty air speed readings which were a large part of the crash. This species also brought down another plane in Washington during 1982."], ["Mud Daubers - National Pest Management Association", "http://www.pestworld.org/pest-guide/stingingbiting-insects/open-pipe-mud-daubers/", "Looking to get rid of mud daubers?

Several species exist in Iowa. These wasps are long and slender with a narrow, thread-like waist. Some are a solid steel blue or black but others have additional yellow markings. \nThis wasp group is named for the nests that are made from mud collected by the females. Mud is rolled into a ball, carried to the nest and molded into place with the wasp's mandibles. There are three different wasps that practice this behavior. The black and yellow mud dauber builds a series of cylindrical cells that are eventually plastered over with mud to form a smooth mud nest about the size of a fist. The organ-pipe mud dauber, a more robust, black species, builds cylindrical tubes resembling pipe-organ pipes. The third species is a beautiful metallic-blue wasp with blue wings. This one does not build its own mud nest but instead uses the abandoned nests of the black and yellow mud dauber. \nAfter completing the mud nest the female captures several insects or spiders to provision the cells. Prey are stung and paralyzed before being placed in the nest. A single egg is deposited on the prey within each cell, and the cell sealed with mud. After the wasp has finished a series of cells, she departs and does not return. The larvae that hatch from the eggs feed on the prey items left by the adult wasp. New adult wasps emerge to start the process over again. \nWasps usually evoke a great deal of anxiety or fear. However, solitary wasps such as the mud daubers do not defend their nest the way social wasps such as hornets and yellowjackets do. Mud daubers are very unlikely to sting, even when thoroughly aroused. They may sting if mishandled. \nControl of these insects is not warranted since they normally pose little threat. Rather, mud daubers should be regarded as beneficial, since they remove and use as prey many species of spiders which most people find disagreeable. The mud nests can be scraped off and discarded at night if they are objectionable, or wasp and hornet aerosol sprays can be used to treat nests if desired. There is no proven method that is effective in discouraging wasps from building nests in sheltered or protected areas. Prompt and frequent removal of nests is suggested in areas favored by the wasps.

There are many species of wasps referred to as mud daubers; some other common names are dirt daubers, organ-pipe wasps, mud wasps and potter wasps. Although their appearance varies greatly, mud daubers generally are from \u00bd to 1 inch long. Mud daubers are colored either completely black or blue metallic. Some species have yellow or greenish markings on the body. The body shape is typically \u201cthread-waisted\u201d with some mud daubers possessing an extremely long and thin, stretched out looking body segment located between the thorax and abdomen.\nMud dauber wasps undergo complete metamorphosis, meaning they have four stages during their life cycle \u2013 egg, larvae (grub/worm-like), pupae (cocoon) and adult. Mud daubers are solitary insects even though in some suitable habitats more than one mud nest will be found. The shape of mud nests helps identify different groups of mud daubers. One nest shape appears as a group of cells that are cylinder-shaped and covered over with mud so it appears to be a smooth mud nest about 2 inches wide and about 4 inches long. Another, the organ pipe group, constructs a nest that looks like a series of tubes resembling the pipes on a pipe organ. Still another mud nest is constructed by the potter wasp that makes a nest resembling a small, clay pot. While most mud daubers make new nests for each generation, a few species will reuse old mud nests constructed by other mud daubers.\nMud daubers complete one or two generations per year, depending on the species. In the spring, the overwintering pupae (cocoon) develop into adults. The new adult females begin building a new nest and after completing the mud nest, begin to capture insects or spiders that are placed into each mud nest cell. Eggs are deposited on the prey within each cell, and the cell sealed with mud. The larvae that hatch from the eggs feed on the prey left by the adult wasp, and then change into the pupal stage (cocoon) that overwinters. Prey are stung and paralyzed, not killed, before being placed in the mud cell. This is crucial since dead prey would decompose and aren\u2019t suitable nourishment for required larval development. The following spring, the pupae become adults, thus beginning the next generation of mud daubers. Adults feed on plant nectar, honeydew and the body fluids of the spiders and insects they capture. At least two species of mud daubers are especially important since they are reported to seek out and capture black widow spiders.\nMud daubers are actually very beneficial since they help reduce the numbers of some pest insects and spiders. Also, they are not likely to sting. However, it is never smart to approach their nests without exercising caution. If mud daubers become a nuisance and insecticide products are the answer, be sure to contact your pest management professional for their recommendations and assistance. If safety is not an issue, remove old, inactive nests. Since some species will reuse old nests, spiders or insect prey carcasses can become a food source for beetles that may contaminate fabrics or food. Scraping off the nest or using a strong stream of water from a garden hose works. In addition, anything done to seal harborage sites such as cracks and holes in buildings is helpful to reduce the prey population.\n\n\t\tGive us a call:\n        \n844-514-3980\n\n\nOr schedule a call with an Orkin Specialist today and get a FREE estimate for:\n\n\t\tThis branch appears close by:\n\t\t\n\n,  \n\n\nNot in ?\n\t\tEnter a zip code below to view local branches.\n\u00a0"], ["Mud Dauber Treatment - U-spray, Inc.", "http://bugspray.com/articles99/muddauber.html", "\n\nMud daubers are a pest throughout all of the United States. There are several species which are the most likely to nest on your home and these include the organ pipe, the black and yellow, the blue, the potter wasp and the mason species. These wasps are so categorized because they create larva rearing mud tubes in which young develop. You will find these nests on the sides of your home.\nIn case this is not what you\u2019re looking for, we also have\u00a0in depth articles on: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0CICADA KILLERS\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0DIGGER WASPS\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0EUROPEAN HORNETS\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0HORNTAIL WASPS\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0WASPS\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 YELLOW JACKETS\n\u00a0\nMud daubers like to construct these nests between brick in the mortar joint, where wood trim facia boards and molding meet and around window and door frames. Their nests are similar yet different. Though they all seem to be the same type of nest, in fact each species has distinct characteristics associated with design patterns of the mud. The easiest to identify is the organ pipe whose nests are long and resemble the way the pipes of an organ sit. Black and yellow daubers build their nests more on top of each other and the other species are different still. Regardless of the way these nests are constructed, mud daubers frighten many people and have been mistaken for termites on too many occasions.\n\u00a0\nMost mud daubers feed on spiders. Females seek out spiders, sting them and deposit their bodies in the back of a larva cell of their nest. An egg is then laid on the spider for the young to feed. A female will typically have several eggs in a single \u201cpipe\u201d and will have 3-6 pipes per nest. If conditions allow, she may have more than one nest. It is not just coincidence that nests seem to prevail on certain homes. It appears to be homes which are stucco, brick or other porous rough surfaces which they like. It is both easier to build nests on such surfaces as well as the fact that nests seem to hold better once constructed on them. This lends credence to the theory that daubers generated from nests built on such surfaces are more likely to use an identical surface for their own reproduction which further explains why one house may seem to be infested with dauber activity!!\n\u00a0\nThough colorful and sometimes bright in color, mud daubers are not as likely to sting as others. It does have a stinger which is used for it\u2019s food but generally will not use it unless provoked. Their bodies are somewhat frail compared to other wasps yet are wizards at using mud and carrying it around to construct their nests. If your house is serving as the local mud dauber neighborhood, there is a simple way to control them. (Don\u2019t waste your time using the garden hose hoping to chase them away. In case you haven\u2019t figured it out, they\u2019ll be back!\n\u00a0\nLike most wasps, they don\u2019t like CYPERMETHRIN. This product is both easy to use and works great at controlling local infestations. Your method of treatment will vary on the time of the year you are treating. If it is spring and they have just begun nest making, simply spray the Cypermethrin on the sides of the home where there is activity.\nCypermethrin: http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/liquid/viper-cypermethrin\n\u00a0\nThis can be done with both a HOSE END SPRAYER or a PUMP SPRAYER.\nPump Sprayer: http://www.bugspraycart.com/good/pump-sprayers\nHose End Sprayer: \u00a0http://www.bugspraycart.com/equipment/sprayers/gilmour-20g-390\n\u00a0\nThough the hose end sprayer is easier to use, it will tend to waste more material since you are applying it so much faster than the pump sprayer. The pump sprayer may not be able to reach quite high enough so you may need both pieces of equipment. Which ever you use, try to get about 500-1000 sq/ft of coverage per gallon of material used. Mix the chemical one ounce to a gallon and start high when treating. This will allow over spray to be efficiently used as it flows down the side of the home.\nMost homes need 2-4 gallons to get adequate protection all the way around. Although you may only see activity on one side of the home, try to treat as many sides as you can. This will prevent them from simply moving to the untreated side of your house instead of moving off your property completely. Expect to make applications about once a month throughout the spring and then a few more during the year.\n\u00a0\nIf you already have a lot of nests, the sequence of treatment should be two steps. First, try to knockdown as many of the nests you can using a stick or some type of pole. Try to use the longest stick or pole you have and don\u2019t be alarmed if you see adults. They should avoid you. If you want some extra protection, get a can of STINGER FREEZE which will drop them as they fly. You may see some larva in the nest as well. They will be white and grub like. Be sure to remove as many of the grubs and as much of the nest that you can reach.\nStinger: \u00a0http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/aerosol/sting-ray-wasp-freeze\n\u00a0\nIf you\u2019re not afraid of getting stung, use DFORCE AEROSOL instead of the Stinger Freeze. Dforce will work just as well on their nests and though it won\u2019t drop them instantly like the Freeze, the time needed to spray is short so your chances of having a mud dauber see you is slim.\nD-Force: \u00a0http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/aerosol/d-force-14-oz-aerosol\n\u00a0\nAnother aerosol that works great on sensitive surfaces like window frames, boats and places where you can\u2019t spray a liquid or the \u201cwet\u201d Dforce is a product that goes on dry known as PHANTOM. This product is ideal for sensitive areas (like boats) because its odorless and when used properly, will both control and prevent insects from nesting. Mud daubers will many times build their nests on tough to treat surfaces and for these areas, the Phantom is perfect for the job.\nPhantom Aerosol: http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/aerosol/pt-phantom-17-5oz\n\u00a0\nIn summary, the longest lasting treatment for the beset overall results will be to use the Cypermethrin sprayed on surfaces where nests are likely to be built. This will kill and repel daubers for several weeks and when you need to reach up high or cover a lot of area, the Cypermethrin is the way to go. For small areas, the Dforce or Phantom can do the job and for sensitive areas, go with the Phantom since its odorless and goes on dry.\nMud daubers are persistent once they identify your home as a place they like to nest. But if you\u2019re able to treat early in the spring, you can expect 1-3 treatments to keep your home dauber free for the season. If you have a big infestation, it will require removing active nests and spraying over as much of the home as possible. This will insure they don\u2019t simply move over to untreated areas.\n\n\nGive us a call if you need further help.

When we\u2019ve finished sailing we flake the mainsail onto the boom and cover it with a canvas \u201cjacket\u201d.  When we return a week later and hoist the sail we often find that mud daubers crept in under the jacket and built nests within the folds of the sail.  We need a repellant but we\u2019re reluctant to use any chemical spray or oil that might discolor our sails, or any solid device that could emit fumes under the hot jacket\u2026.for the same reason.  Any ideas?  Is the Waspinator effective against mud daubers?\nI don\u2019t think the Waspinator will help in this case because mud daubers do not appear to be \u201cterritorial\u201d. Additionally, the Waspinator mimics a different species altogether and one daubers do not fear. Lastly, people who\u2019ve tried using one for mud daubers have not gotten any positive results so I can\u2019t recommend it.\nWhat I do know is that I keep a boat on a local lake and fight with Mud Daubers who nest just under the canvas covers I use to cover my boat. The boat is 25\u2032 long with two large covers and daubers will target any edge. Their nests have been an ongoing issue for many years nesting just under the cover and in the folds and seams of the canvas. They also enter air vents to my hull and motor compartment where they build messy mud nests that have caused motor issues in the past.\nTo deal with the problem, I started applying Phantom Aerosol to any surface they want to use. This aerosol is unique in that it goes on \u201cdry\u201d, is odorless and after using it for more than a year, has not discolored or affected the canvas (black) or the boat decking in any way. Even when freshly applied it does not make the surface \u201cwet\u201d or leave any visible residue. I now \u201cmist\u201d into all the exhaust vents as well as the canvas edging and this has proven to work well at stopping them.\nI also use Phantom throughout my home for various pests because I have hardwood floors and cannot spray any kind of liquid without making a mess. Phantom goes on without leaving any sign it\u2019s there so in my opinion, this would be your best bet.\nOne other thing; Phantom doesn\u2019t work fast like most insecticides. It will take a good 2-3 days to have any kind of impact on targeted insects so don\u2019t expect to see wasps dead just after treating. What I find happens is that one week after I treat, all the activity around my boat ceases. And if I treat once a month, it seems to keep them away for the season.\nPhantom: http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/aerosol/pt-phantom-17-5oz\nWaspinator:  http://www.bugspraycart.com/traps/pheromone-and-food/waspinator-repellent-nest\nI have mud daubers making nests in the ground. They leave holes where they enter and exit. I have at least 30 holes and because they are so active I can\u2019t weed or even walk close to where they are. They\u2019re are on the south side of the house so it is all day sun.  Help! Thanks.\nRosanne\nI suspect you have either Digger Wasps or Cicada Killers. As explained in our article above, Mud Daubers build their nests on the side of structures and not in the ground.\nRegardless of which wasp it turns out to be, if you want them gone you\u2019ll need to drench their nests with Cypermethrin. Use 1/4 to 1/2 gallon of mixed solution per nest. And mix the Cypermethrin up at 1 oz per gallon of water.\nCypermethrin: http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/liquid/viper-cypermethrin\nDo the treatment in the evening for best results. More details on how to use this method of treating is in the Cicada Killer article here:\nCicada Killers: http://www.bugspray.com/articles99/cicadakillers.html\nAnd our Digger Wasp article can be found here:\nDigger Wasps:  http://www.bugspray.com/articles99/diggerwasps.html\nWe have blue mud daubers around the casing of our in ground pool at two corners and we can\u2019t seem to get rid  of them. We killed one and compared it to make sure that they are indeed blue mud daubers we need them gone because of allergies and little kids.  Please help!!!!!\nTreating with the Cypermethrin mentioned above would work fine if you\u2019re able to do the treatment without getting the spray into the pool water. But a better option would be to dust the crack and void with some Deltamethrin Dust using a Hand Duster. This would be easy to do, kill any dauber nests immediately and last a good month or two. Plus any dust that drifts into the water would be rendered harmless because all you need is water to clean it up.\nHere are links to these items in our cart.

Thanks for your business!\nDelta Dust: http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/dust/deltamethrin-dust\nHand Duster: http://www.bugspraycart.com/equipment/dusters/crusader\nWe live in the country and the wasps are building nests in every can light in our covered decks. I can remove the light bulb, but you have to stick your hand inside to remove the baffle which I don\u2019t want to do. Any type of spray I can use without damaging the light components?\nWe have a unique aerosol that will handle this problem. Phantom is both odorless and fine to use around electrical components. When used properly, it will go on \u201cdry\u201d. In fact I have problems with both spiders and mud daubers on my boat. The daubers like to enter exhaust vents and build nests inside the motor compartment. Spiders like building nests all over the decking of the boat. But by treating these areas every 2-3 weeks during the spring, summer and fall, I\u2019ve been able to effectively stop this behavior for good. And since the Phantom is odorless and goes on dry, you can\u2019t even tell anything been applied to the boat. For cosmetic reasons, this is important.\nAdditionally, since my engine compartment has a lot of electrical components, I have to be careful what I use there. The good news is that after a few years of using the Phantom on the wiring, I know it\u2019s not done any damage or had any impact other than eliminating the pest problem I was treating so I know it will work for you too.\nBasically all you need to do is direct the spray alongside the light bulb, without having to remove it, and give a one second blast to 2-3 sides of the bulb which will completely treat the can. This should effectively cover the area and though you won\u2019t see immediate results, the treatment will kill anything that touches the treated surface in 1-2 days. So with daubers, I find by 3 days after the treatment, they\u2019re all dead.\nRetreat during the warm summer months twice a month and you\u2019ll be able to solve this problem for good.\nPhantom: http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/aerosol/pt-phantom-17-5oz\n@Tech Support:\nWill it kill what is in the mud (nest) also, or do I have to knock down the nest?\nNothing can kill developing pupae so if there are any deep inside the mud nest, no, they\u2019ll still be alive. But if the nest is new, like two weeks or less in development, there won\u2019t be any eggs laid just yet. \nThat being said, what I always suggest is to treat with the Phantom, wait 3 days for it to kick in and then knock down any nest you can find. In theory, no new nests should ever develop after you knock down the old nests if you wait at least 3 days and follow the recommended schedule.\n@Tech Support:\nWe bought a can of Phantom and have used it successfully all season\u2026..after each sail we\u2019d spray all edges of the sail cover and also the end access points, including the sail\u2019s luff.  Only one mud dauber found its way under our sail cover and that was likely due to: 1) inattention (3 weeks lapse) on our part, and 2) not thinking that a prolonged rain might diminish some of Phantom\u2019s effectiveness.  A quick weekly spray does the job and we\u2019ve gone 2 weeks between sprays without any bug access.\nGreat to hear! I use Phantom all the time on my boat (no sails but lots of holes for them to access) and I wish I was as persistent as you! My New Year\u2019s resolution will be to make sure I get an application done once every two weeks. My current spray routine (once a month) holds off the mud daubers fine but not the spiders. I think I\u2019ll ramp up my efforts in 2013 to once every 2 weeks and I bet that will do the trick. Again, good to hear you\u2019ve been wasp free and happy sailing in 2013!\nPhantom: http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/aerosol/pt-phantom-17-5oz\nI have hundreds of nests up in my attic; just discovered them.  They seem dormant at the moment.  Should I knock them down and get rid of them or leave them?\nIf you have access, I would remove them. This can generally be done with any kind of scraper. Since mud daubers will be over wintering and ready to hatch out this spring, removing them now will help reduce problems for you this spring and summer.\nNext, I\u2019d either dust or spray all the exposed wood with Drione (dust) or Bifen (spray). The Drione would be the longest lasting solution. Albeit the treatment will be a bit more tedious to make but one dusting a year is all you\u2019d need to do and for me, because Drione works so well it\u2019s well worth the time and effort to get it applied.\nDrione:  http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/dust/drione-dust\nAlternatively, if you wanted to spray something, the Bifen can last 2-3 months and would be easier to apply. However, you\u2019ll need to treat at least 3 times per season to keep them out of this space all year.\nBifen IT:  http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/liquid/bifen\nLastly, I\u2019d try to isolate how they\u2019re getting into this space. My bet is you have an attic vent with screening that\u2019s not quite \u201ctight\u201d enough. Inspect any vents to your attic and if you find screening that\u2019s too wide, missing or damaged, add a tighter mess screen to help sure it up and keep the daubers out. In the end, blocking their way into this space can be an effective strategy for sure.\n@Tech Support: Good information! I have these holes all along the edge of my pond, sometimes going down to the water level and causing the ground to sink in spots. I\u2019ve been filling the holes with Sakrete and filling in the last couple of inches with dirt. I can imagine an archeologist digging up my yard in 200 years and wondering about the meaning of those concrete pillars!\nWe have a 20\u2032 porch ceiling and mud daubers like to nest on the high walls back there.  Can Cypermethrin be used in a power washer\u2026.it\u2019s the only thing that will reach that height.  And if so what about blowback spray\u2026is it harmful to humans?\nAs a general rule, it\u2019s very wasteful to spray any insecticide that high onto an inverted surface because most of the material you apply will simply drip off. \nBut can it be applied this way? Yes. And if you equip yourself with some rubber gloves, a face shield and a protective suit, you could proceed without getting any of the mixed product on the person doing the application.\nCypermethrin: http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/liquid/viper-cypermethrin\nFace Shield:  http://www.bugspraycart.com/equipment/safety/face-shield-kit\nLarge Coveralls: http://www.bugspraycart.com/equipment/safety/coveralls-disposable-large\nWe also know of customers using our Hose End sprayers to apply the cypermethrin this way and though messy, most any garden hose can spray this 20 feet up using this sprayer:\nHose End Sprayer:  http://www.bugspraycart.com/equipment/sprayers/gilmour-20g-390e\nAlternatively, using a paint brush or a paint roller at the end of a long extension pole would prove to be a lot more effective resulting in very little chemical waste. No doubt it will take longer to apply but in the end, you\u2019ll only need to use 1 gallon of mixed solution per 500 sq/ft.\nNow if you choose to spray, expect to use 3-4 times as much of the Cypermethrin since most of it will be dripping off. For this reason the \u201cefficiency factor\u201d can be big dollar wise.\nLastly, we also have many people using a misting machine to \u201cmist\u201d such areas. This is by far the most effective way to cover the area and as long as you can get within 15 feet of the surfaces you want reach, the misting machines will blanket the surface evenly. \nUsing this method, you can get adequate coverage for the same 500 sq/ft in just 30-60 seconds. And you\u2019ll be using a lot less material. Maybe just 16-32 oz of mixed solution compared to 1 gallon or more when spraying and most of it is dripping away. \nNo doubt the machine needed is an investment but since it will last for many years, it will effectively pay for itself in chemical cost savings and since it can be used in the yard for mosquitoes, gnats and other biting pests, a device that can be put to use for sure.\nFM6309:  http://www.bugspraycart.com/equipment/foggers/fogmaster-6309-120-v\nOne last note; for areas like ceilings, you\u2019ll find Onslaught to be a better product over the Cypermethrin. This is because it will last 6-12 months per treatment and for exterior ceilings, it\u2019s the way to go if you don\u2019t feel like spraying every month or two. \nI use it for my front porch ceiling which is only 10 feet hight and I actually paint it on. I go through around 1 gallon since I\u2019ve got a large bead board ceiling up there but the treatment takes care of daubers, spiders and moths we so it\u2019s well worth the time doing the treatment.\nOnslaught: http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/liquid/onslaught\nGreat info, thanks!  Can the Onslaught also be used in and around boats without staining or discoloring the covers?\nIt can. But as a boat owner myself, I\u2019m not sure liquid sprays are your best bet. Now if you\u2019ve got a cabin cruiser that has a lot of carpeting, using a liquid is fine. But I have a deck boat with lots of high glossy finishes so a liquid isn\u2019t the best for these areas. And for my covers \u2013 especially where my bimini top zippers onto the metal frame that holds it in place \u2013 I use an aerosol called Phantom.\nPhantom: http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/aerosol/pt-phantom-17-5oz\nPhantom is odorless and goes on \u201cdry\u201d. A light misting to all the edges of my three covers is all I need to do every 2-3 weeks and it stops mud daubers as well as spiders. I get tons of spider webs on my boat along with the daubers but the Phantom keeps both under control. \nI use it for all the air vents found on the boat too since the daubers love going in these to nest. I\u2019m talking about the engine exhaust ports and air vents as well as around the engine covers and basically, any door frame.\nYou may want to give the Phantom a shot; it\u2019s handy, easy to use and is ideally suited for use at the dock and boat.\nThis is our second summer in our home, which is a log home. Already the mud daubers are out of control. Most of the advice I\u2019ve seen on getting rid of them entails destroying the nests. The problem is I can\u2019t find them. I\u2019ve found a few in boxes in the garage and destroyed them but that\u2019s not even where we have the wasp problem. They swarm the outside walls of the house. They\u2019re always there but I never see any nests on the walls out the house. To make things worse, somehow they get inside. We don\u2019t even open our windows. We run the ac instead hoping that that will prevent them from getting inside but it doesn\u2019t help. The house is brand new and so the windows are in perfect condition and the screens fit perfectly and tightly. Still they\u2019ll be in between the screen and the window. Just now one flew out of the upstairs bedroom and he seemed to come from nowhere. I can hear them buzzing around through the beams in the upstairs bedroom. It\u2019s almost as if they are inside the walls looking for a way out and then eventually get out into the house. I feel helpless. Do you think it\u2019s possible that they have bested in the walls of our home? What should I do?\nI have seen mud daubers do this on old brick homes, cedar homes and log homes. Basically any home that has a lot of cracks and gaps is prime real estate and certain bees and wasps will take advantage of these spaces to create areas to nest.\nNow on most homes, the nests will be on the outside of the structure. And to treat these nests is fairly easy. Scrap them down and spray with some Cypermethrin to repel the wasps and prevent new nests from forming. But how do you handle a situation like you have where nests which are mostly hidden?\nThe answer is to use a dust. In fact, Drione Dust is a great product for treating log homes for all kinds of pests. When applied to cracks and crevices, the Drione will drift around in the hidden space and lightly cover the areas where mud daubers move and traverse. And when they come in contact with the dust, they\u2019ll meet certain demise.\nApply the Drione with a Hand Duster if you can reach around all the windows, soffits, vents, door frames, etc. where they\u2019re likely entering your wall voids. But if the home is a two story structure, a Dustick will prove to be quite helpful.\nNow once you\u2019ve dusted every crack you can find, let the treatment sit a day. During this time the dust will be killing any wasps that come in contact with the dust and if you treat the majority of the entry ways they\u2019re using, most will die within 1-2 days. And over the next few days, most activity will cease. \nOn the day after you dust, you need to spray the siding of the home with Cypermethrin. This product will both repel and kill any that you miss with the dust and should be applied every 2-4 weeks to insure more don\u2019t come around to start new nests.\nOne more product worth mentioning is NBS Stain Additive. This product can be added to any type of stain you use for the logs which will enable the stain to act as an insect repellent. It works great on wasps, carpenter bees, etc. and will last a year or more which will also reduce the amount of spraying with Cypermethrin you\u2019ll have to do during the warm seasons.\nHere are links to these items in our cart.

We can\u2019t enter our garage. We had an infestation of spiders before the wasps and then dirt dobbers moved in. We need a permanent solution. We use the garage for storage, boat, etc. We can spray, apply powder, or whatever and wanted to also know if there was a stinging light we could use as prevention. Please help.\nThis is an easy one. First, remove as many of the spider webs as you can. If you can\u2019t reach them all, get a Web Remover. They\u2019re well worth the investment.\nSecond, mix up Cypermethrin at 1 oz per gallon of water and fan spray it over the exterior siding, all the windows, under soffits and around the doorways to the garage and workshop. Cypermethrin will provide instant knockdown and control of wasps, spiders and roaches. Use a good pump sprayer to make this application.\nNext, apply Phantom aerosol to any cracks, voids and spaces where you suspect any of these pests might be hiding. This can be done outside but also inside the workshop and garage. Phantom is odorless, lasts a month when applied inside and goes on \u201cdry\u201d so it won\u2019t make a mess. Just understand that its not a quick killing agent; in fact it will take 2-3 days to kill target insects but this is by design. Once it kicks in, target pests won\u2019t stand a chance.\nIf you follow these directions, you should be insect free within a week and if you treat monthly with the Cypermethrin after the problem is solved, you should be able to keep these pests under control.\n\nHere are links to these items in our cart. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Please show your support for our business by purchasing the items we recommend from the links provided.

The biggest problem is wasps of some kind. They crawl down into the cracks on the top deck. The top deck is wood on top and has metal underneath. Do you think they have nests in between the wood and metal? The space is about six inches in height and 32 x 32 feet (length and width). If so, is there a way to treat the dock without damaging fish, etc. in the water? A secondary problem is spider webs. We knock them down and they are back within hours.\nYou most likely have mud daubers nesting on the bottom side of the second level decking. I spend a lot of time on a local lake (Lake Lanier) know two level docks quite well. Over the years, I\u2019ve seen your type of problem many times. The good news is you can easily treat and maintain these pests.\nIn fact, I happen to keep a boat on Lanier under a covered dock. I mention this because it relates to your problem. My dock is only one level but the roof is metal and mud daubers love building nests above my boat. I also have a massive spider problem so it would appear that we have similar pest issues.\nNow a few years ago a product came out which I found to be perfect for both problems. Known as Phantom, this material is an aerosol that goes on \u201cdry\u201d, has no odor and insects won\u2019t notice its been applied. This makes it perfect for use on boats and boat docks.\nSo for my boat, I\u2019m able to lightly mist the outer most edge of the decking (where the spiders like to web) without making a mess. My boat is a deck boat and it tends to get webs under the railing, around and under the Bimini top as well as my fishing rod holders. But when I lightly mist these areas 2-3 a month during the spring, summer and fall, I can stop the spiders. \nI also get mud daubers entering my motor compartment through the air vents. To stop them from using my engine compartment, I simply treat with the Phantom into the vents. \nLastly, I have the mud daubers and spiders making nests above my boat. Again, lightly misting the underside of the roof stops them completely and treatments up there will last a good month since it\u2019s protected from the sun and rain. The spraying on the boat don\u2019t last as long since I take the boat out into the sun, rain, etc. But underneath the roof, it\u2019s protected so it can last a lot longer.\nSo for your problem, the Phantom would definitely be the way to go. Its easy to use and if you were to treat every gap in the decking of the top level of the dock, you\u2019ll be \u201cfogging\u201d the aerosol into the space underneath. This will enable the Phantom to get onto the bottom side of the wood and by doing so, stop the mud daubers from using this area. And since its the bottom side they\u2019re no doubt targeting, treatments will last fairly long since they won\u2019t be taking direct sunlight or rain.\nNow its important to understand that you\u2019ll need to along every crack using the included straw tube injector that fits into the spray nozzle. Though this might sound difficult, it\u2019s actually quite easy to do. And you only need to spray around 1 second per foot of crack so you will probably only use 1/4 to 1/2 of a can per treatment.\nNext, treat above the decking where spider webs accumulate. This can be done on both levels as well as on the boat if the spiders are active on board your vessel. Since Phantom goes on dry and is odorless, you only need to keep people and pets away when treating. But once applied and allowed to dry for 30-60 minutes, everyone can return to the area and use it as normal with no hazard or safety issue. \nAlso, when used properly, there will be no risk or problem for the water and fish below. Remember, you don\u2019t need to over apply. Just lightly misting is all that\u2019s needed so the treatment will be staying on the deck when done properly.\nNow something you need to understand is that Phantom is very different from most any aerosol. As it\u2019s name implies, insects don\u2019t notice it so it\u2019s like a \u201cphantom\u201d to them. This way they will readily walk over the treatment, bring some back to their nests and in doing so, contaminate their eggs, larvae, etc. This insures it gets all stages of the problem.\nBut this also means the active is slow to work. So in most cases, insects won\u2019t die for 2-3 days following a treatment. In other words, it\u2019s not a \u201ccontact killer\u201d so don\u2019t spray bugs directly and expect to see them drop dead. This won\u2019t happen.\nPhantom Aerosol: http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/aerosol/pt-phantom-17-5oz\nGive us a call if you need more help.

Now the holes are filled with mud which leads me to think it\u2019s actually a mud dauber nest. I have the Drione now, but I want to know if I should poke a stick or something in the hole to break up the mud so I can dust? I just don\u2019t want a swarm flying out at me if I do. Any suggestions?\nI live in Florida and have mud daubers all over my home and I\u2019m getting ready to repaint the entire house.  The painters will remove the nests when pressure washing the home prior to painting.  Is there anything they can add to the paint itself which will help repel the mud daubers from re-nesting all around the home?\nYes. Have them add NBS to the paint.

I usually remain in \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe cocoon over the winter and emerge in the spring from the cell as an adult wasp.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMy life span from egg to adult is about one year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n"], ["Organ-pipe Mud Dauber", "http://www.fcps.edu/islandcreekes/ecology/organ-pipe_mud_dauber.htm", "\u00a0Trypoxylon\npolitum\n\u00a0\nCopyright, John\nTriffe\nNote: The information and images for this\nwebpage were collected chiefly from two websites: \"Organ\nPipe Wasps\" at www.pollinator.com\nand Hilton\nPond Center Those interested in\nlearning more about these fascinating creatures should visit these\nsites.\n\n\n\nThe Organ-pipe\n                  Mud Dauber is a common wasp whose home is\n                  recognized more often than the insect\n                  itself.\nOrgan-pipe Mud\n                  Daubers are about an inch long and bluish-black,\n                  with a very thin waist.\nThey are most\n                  often seen on the sides of buildings where they are\n                  building a nest, or on the ground in places where\n                  there is soft mud.\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright 2001,\n                  by David L.

Green, used with permission www.pollinator.com\nAfter breeding, female\n         Organ-pipe Mud Daubers look for a suitable place to build a\n         nest. It must be close by some mud with the right type of\n         soil (usually clay). Typically, they build on walls of\n         buildings; but mud dauber nests have also been found on\n         chimneys, under porches, in attics, and inside birdhouses.\n         They've even been found on parked cars!\nThe female mud dauber\n         starts building her nest by rolling small bits of mud into a\n         ball. She then carries each mudball to the nest site, where\n         she forms a cylinder-shaped tube.\nWhen a tube is big\n         enough, she must locate some prey. Young Organ-pipe Mud\n         Daubers eat spiders; so she finds spiders one at a time,\n         stings them, carries them to the nest, and stuffs them into\n         the tube. When enough spiders are packed in, the female mud\n         dauber lays an egg inside and seals the tube with clay. She\n         then returns with more clay and extends the tube by adding\n         on several chambers. Each chamber is stuffed with spiders\n         and a single egg.\n\nCopyright 2001, by David\n         L. Green, used with permission www.pollinator.com\nCopyright 2001, by David L.

They make a variety of nests ranging from elaborate structures (i.e., multiple tubes several inches long or small vase-like nests attached to plant stems) to merely 'plastering' up existing cracks or crevices in wood, stone, or masonry. Many mud daubers will fill holes in round openings found in equipment and lawn furniture. These wasps range in size from one-half inch in length to slightly more than one inch. They often have bright, metallic coloration and narrow thread-like waists. Like other wasps and bees, metamorphosis is complete, and the immature wasps look like worms. Mud daubers are not social insects, although many females may be found using the same general areas for nesting.\n\nYellow and black mud dauber constructing a nest cell.\n Photo: Howard Ensign Evans, Bugwood.org\nThese nests are brood chambers for raising their young and are constructed and stocked by one female. Some species will repair old nests from previous seasons and reuse them. The nests are constructed as or divided into cells about one inch in length and usually are stocked with spiders, which have been immobilized by the females' stings.\n\nOrgan pipe mud dauber nest cells.\n Photo: Powell Smith, Clemson University\nThe venom acts as a preservative keeping the prey in proper condition to allow the larvae to develop. An egg is laid in each cell stocked with several prey individuals. When the egg hatches, the larvae feed on the prey. Upon completion of its development, the new wasp will chew a hole in the cell wall and emerge. Many of our most common species such as the yellow and black mud daubers and organ-pipe mud daubers use spiders for prey, but other species use a variety of insects ranging from caterpillars to cockroaches to stock the nests. Some related species that burrow into the ground catch large insects such as katydids and cicadas.\nMud daubers are not aggressive insects and rarely sting, unless they are threatened or inadvertently contacted. Although the venom is primarily for paralyzing and preserving prey, it is painful. The yellow and black mud dauber was rated a 1 on a pain scale ranging from 1 (mild) to 4 (severe), which was the same rating as the red imported fire ant (Encyclopedia of Insects - Eds. Resh and Card\u00e9).\nThese insects are not really pests, but some possibly would describe them as nuisances. Mud daubers that stock their nests with caterpillars are beneficial insects. Since many consider spiders to be pests or at least nuisances, spider-collecting mud daubers could be considered beneficial, also. However, since spiders also reduce insect populations, this viewpoint is questionable. Habitat modification to reduce the attractiveness of an area to spiders, which are the major prey of mud daubers, is one means of reducing mud dauber activity. This would include caulking or plastering cracks where spiders could live or hide and regularly removing webs in corners and crevices. Household insecticides can be used to discourage spiders, also. Manual removal of nests may discourage mud daubers as well as reduce later generations. Also, screening or caulking of any openings that may allow access into buildings will prevent nesting in these areas.\nChemical control may be necessary in cases of known allergies to wasp or bee stings or due to large numbers of mud daubers around areas of high pedestrian traffic or entrances. Insecticides registered for use in a specific area should be used according to label instructions. Insecticides containing pyrethrins or synthetic pyrethroids are very effective in general for wasps and wasp-like insects and will quickly 'knock down' flying insects. They are not to be used to attempt to contact insects in flight, but the package information refers to the very quick effect of these chemicals on the insect nervous system. This type of insecticide often comes in containers that will spray a straight stream up to 20 feet. This way one can treat the nests without exposing themselves to stings. Normally, late evening or early mornings when the insects are less active are the times to use this type of treatment.\nPage maintained by: Home & Garden Information Center\nThis information is supplied with the understanding that no discrimination is intended and no endorsement of brand names or registered trademarks by the Clemson University Cooperative Extension Service is implied, nor is any discrimination intended by the exclusion of products or manufacturers not named.

The female hunts for spiders to bring back to the nest as future food for larvae. The male guards the nest to protect the larval cells from intruders, such as parasites. Though dirt daubers have stingers, they are primarily used to sting and paralyze spiders. Even when their nests are disturbed, mud daubers do not react with defensive stinging as other wasps do. While dirt dauber wasps do not require control, putting management methods into effect when dirt daubers create a nuisance or when they are present near those with wasp allergies is a wise decision.\nObserve the bodies of the dirt daubers and the shape and consistency of their nests to ensure you are dealing with nonaggressive wasps instead of stinging wasps. Look for black-and-yellow bodies or black-and-metallic-blue bodies with threadlike waists and a total length of approximately 1 inch.\nSearch carefully for nests in areas preferred by dirt daubers, including garages, attic spaces or areas beneath roofs or eaves.\nExamine nests which are made out of mud, typically constructed of several parallel tubes. Search for the presence of only one female and one male mud dauber tending to each nest, rather than several wasps.\nClean spiderwebs off of all surfaces surrounding the home with a broom. Fill cracks in home walls or nearby structures with plaster to decrease potential nesting spots for dirt daubers and hiding spots for spiders. Decreasing the dirt daubers' shelter and food sources forces the wasps to seek a more beneficial place to nest.\nSwat dirt daubers forcefully with a fly swatter for natural control if they enter the vicinity of an allergic person.\nScrape away and destroy dirt dauber nests with a flat-edged metal tool, such as a putty knife, to displace current dirt daubers, to avoid attracting new dirt daubers and to kill any developing larvae within the nest which may otherwise emerge as adults.\nSpray nests when dirt dauber activity is low during late evening or early in the morning, suggests the Clemson Cooperative Extension. Spray with a pesticide that contains pyrethrins as a chemical control option. Search for this spray formulated as a hornet or wasp killer in a can that is capable of creating a straight spray shot from several feet away. Purchase the pesticide from a local home improvement or garden supply store.\nTarah Damask's writing career began in 2003 and includes experience as a fashion writer/editor for Neiman Marcus, short fiction publications in \"North Texas Review,\" a self-published novel, band biographies, charter school curriculum and articles for various websites.

Being true social insects, these critters have a\nwell-developed caste system.\u00a0 In a\ntypical mature wasp nest there are many workers and one or more kings and\nqueens.\u00a0 Unlike some of the other social\ninsects discussed in this CD, there are fewer differences in the appearance of\neach caste.\nHornets, yellow jackets\nand paper wasps all exhibit the same general life cycle. Their nesting cycle is\nannual, with only mated queens surviving the winter in a variety of protected\nlocations--including under bark and in attics.\u00a0\nIn early spring the queen emerges and may reoccupy an old nest, or\nconstruct a new one.\u00a0 Regardless of which\ncondition prevails, the queen initially deposits a few single eggs-one to each\ncell. Upon hatching, the larvae are fed a variety of insect larvae (mainly\ncaterpillars) that are captured and brought back to the nest by the adult queen\nwasp.\nThe adult wasps feed primarily on nectar, ripe fruit and other\nsubstances that are high in sugar.\u00a0 They\ndo require a certain amount of protein in their diet which is typically acquired\nfrom the larvae.\u00a0 As adults wasps are\nfeeding their larvae, the larvae exude a proteinaceous material from their\nmouth that is quickly consumed by the adult. The majority of these larvae will\ndevelop into adult workers, which take over the duties of expanding the nest,\ncollecting food and feeding the young (Figure 18A). The queen continues to lay\nmore eggs; this results in several generations with the colony continuing to\nincrease in size into the fall.\u00a0 In the\nlate fall, new kings and queens are produced, mating occurs, and the newly\nmated queens overwinter, completing the annual cycle.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nLeft.

Besides\nthe initial pain I itched for several days.

Instead, it\nis called a hornet in the American sense of a wasp that builds paper nests,\nespecially one of the subfamily\u00a0Vespinae. It is not a \"true hornet\" in the British\nsense, that is, a member of the genus\u00a0Vespa\u00a0in the same\nsubfamily, such as the\u00a0Asian giant hornet\u00a0or the\u00a0European hornet.\nThe bald-faced hornet lives throughout\u00a0North America, including southern\u00a0Canada, the Rocky\nMountains, the western coast of the United States, and most of the eastern US.\nThey are most common in the southeastern\u00a0United States. They are best known for their large football-shaped\u00a0paper\u00a0nest, which they build in the spring for raising their\nyoung. These nests can sometimes reach 3 feet tall. Like the\u00a0median wasp\u00a0(Dolichovespula\nmedia) in\u00a0Europe, bald-faced\nhornets are extremely protective of their nests and will sting repeatedly if\ndisturbed.\nEvery year,\u00a0queens\u00a0that were\nborn and\u00a0fertilized\u00a0at the end\nof the previous season begin a new colony. The queen selects a location for its\nnest, begins building it, lays a first batch of eggs and feeds this first group\nof larvae. These become workers and will assume the chore of expanding the nest\n\u2014 done by chewing up\u00a0wood\u00a0which is mixed with a\u00a0starch\u00a0in their\u00a0saliva. This\nmixture is then spread with their mandibles\u00a0and legs,\ndrying into the paper-like substance that makes up the nest.

These hibernate underground, on hollow trees until\nspring or other protected locations. The nest itself is generally abandoned by\nwinter, and will most likely not be reused. When spring arrives, the young\nqueens emerge and the cycle begins again.\nBald-faced hornets visit flowers for nectar,\nespecially in late summer, and can be minor\u00a0pollinators.\nLike other social wasps, bald-faced hornets have a\u00a0caste\u00a0system made up, in one nest, of the\nfollowing: Queen \u2014 the fertile female which starts the colony and lays eggs;\nWorkers \u2014 infertile females which do all work except laying eggs; Drones \u2014 males,\nwhich have no stingers, and are born from unfertilized eggs; New queens \u2014\nfertile females, each of which, once fertilized, may start its own nest in the\nspring.\nBald-face hornets will sting repeatedly if disturbed.\n\u00a0Like other\nstinging wasps, they can sting repeatedly because the stinger does not become\nstuck in the skin. \u00a0Some suggest putting\u00a0baking soda\u00a0or\u00a0meat tenderizer\u00a0on the area\nof the sting,\u00a0but others\nsay such treatments do not work.\n\nEuropean Hornet-Vespa crabro.\u00a0\nThis species is commonly known simply as the \"hornet\", is the largest European\u00a0 true social\u00a0wasp.

Some people\nbelieve that \"three stings from the European hornet can kill an adult\nhuman, and that seven can kill a horse\". These are common myths - a sting\nfrom a European hornet isn't any more dangerous than any other wasp sting, and\nEuropean hornets are less aggressive than other wasps. In contrast, multiple\u00a0Asian giant hornets\u00a0stings are, in fact, more dangerous.\nWhile impressive due to their size and loud sound,\nEuropean hornets are in fact much less aggressive than some of their smaller\nrelatives, such as the\u00a0German wasp\u00a0and the\ncommon wasp. When approached, European hornets can actually be seen to slowly\ncrawl backwards and eventually flee, rather than attack. This can make it hard\nto remove hornets from indoors, if they happen to come in through an open\nwindow or door. While not aggressive when encountered far from the nest,\nmultiple workers will vigorously defend the nest if provoked. Nests can be\napproached without provocation (by moving slowly and not breathing towards the\nnest) to about 20\u00a0inches. Nests are usually not a problem outside buildings,\nbut because they drip feces, a bad smelling black liquid, nests inside sheds or\nwalls can be a problem.\nUnwarranted fear has often led to the destruction of\nnests, leading to the decline of the species, which is often locally threatened\nor even endangered. European hornets benefit from legal protection in some\ncountries, notably\u00a0Germany, where it has been illegal to kill a European hornet\nor nest since 1 January 1987, with a fine up to 50,000 Euros. \nEuropean hornets are attracted to lights at night, but\nare not attracted to human foods and food wastes. However, they can totally\ndestroy fruits, such as apples, while the fruit is still on the tree. This is\nquite unlike the\u00a0bald-faced hornet\u00a0or other\nsocial wasps.\nThe Japanese Hornet.

A searching hornet may actually follow\na foraging bee back to its hive.\u00a0 Once\nfinding the hive it attacks giving off the alarm pheromone attracting other\nhornet in the vicinity. Ultimately they typically attack in force with a\nrelatively small but very effective army of 30 or more.\u00a0 You wouldn\u2019t think such a small army would be\nthat successful since a beehive can have upwards of 80,000 bees.\u00a0 However, one hornet can kill 40 bees a\nminute.\u00a0 Unfortunately honeybees possess relatively\nsmall stingers that are of minimal use in penetrating the thick exocutile of\nthe invading hornets nor do they defend in mass. The hornets descend on the\nhive and systematically one by one cut the bees in half. In the interest of\nefficiency they typically cut off the defending bees heads.\u00a0 After a few hours the hive contains few if\nany adult bees but there are piles of heads, limbs and various other body\nparts.\u00a0 At that point the hornets gorge\non the honey and rip the bee larvae (young) and pupae from their cells and\ncarry them back to their nest to feed to their young.\nHowever all is not totally lost.\u00a0 There is different species of honeybee which\nnaturally occurs in Japan that has a defensive tactic it uses against these\ninvaders.\u00a0 When a single hornet in search\na beehive is detected, hundreds of the worker bees gather at the hive entrance\nbut readily allow the hornet to enter.\u00a0\nOnce in the hive the bees immediately surround and totally cover the\nhornet with a ball-like mass of up to 500 individuals.\u00a0 They prevent the hornet from moving and begin\nto vibrate their wings muscles.\u00a0 This\naction produces heat raising the temperature in the center of the mass (where\nthe hornet occurs) to around 117 F.\u00a0 This\ntemperature is not lethal to the bees but the hornet cannot tolerate\ntemperatures above 113 F and subsequently dies.\u00a0\nOf course action prevents the \u201cscout\u201d hornet from releasing its\npheromones which would normally attract other hornets in the vicinity to mass\nattack the hive.\nIn the mountains of Japan where these hornets are\ncommonly encountered villagers eat them deep fried.\u00a0 Also a number of companies in Europe and\nJapan have begun to manufacture diet supplements and energy drinks which\ncontain synthetic versions of secretions which the larval hornets feed to adults.\u00a0 The product sold as \u201chornet juice\u201d is said to\ngreatly enhance human endurance.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Parasitic (Parasitoids) Hymenoptera\nThere are many families of Hymenoptera\nthat are parasitic. In strict entomological terms they are referred to as\nparasitoids.\u00a0 In the world of bugs\nparasite refers to an insect or one of its relatives (e.g. mites) that feeds on\na host from a different groups animals (e.g. humans) but does not generally\nkill it in doing so.\u00a0 Example of this\nwould include fleas, mites, lice and many others.\u00a0 A parasitoid is an insect or relative that\ntypically lays its egg or eggs on or in its host which typically belong to the\nsame group or animals (e.g. insect laying its eggs on another insect).\u00a0 Once the eggs hatch the larvae feed and\ndevelop internally or externally on that host and in doing so kill it.\nThread\nWaisted Wasps. As a\ngroup most thread waisted wasps are characterized by an elongated waist or\npetiole that joins the thorax to the abdomen. These are commonly found around\nthe home.\u00a0 However some species have a\nnarrow waist.\u00a0 In this case they can be separated\nfrom Vespidae by the front wing not bring folded longitudinally. These wasps\ncan easily be distinguished from other similarly appearing wasps by the\nelongated stalk or petiole that connects the thorax to the abdomen; hence\nanother common name is the thread-waisted wasps.\u00a0 The black and yellow mud dauber, Even though\nthese are solitary insects a single nest may be composed of several elongated\ncylindrical cells made of mud and placed side by side until the make a mass\nabout the size of a fist.\u00a0 The entire\nstructure is then plastered over to make a smooth and even outer surface.\u00a0 Each inner cell is provided with several\ninsect larvae or paralyzed spiders that the adult female has collected.\u00a0 A single egg is then deposited in each cell\nand the hatching wasp larvae complete their development on the provided\nprey.\u00a0 These wasps are much less\naggressive than solitary forms, as they do not protect their nest.\u00a0 About the only way someone could be stung by\none of these wasps is by accidentally stepping on or carelessly handling one,\nwhich seem very unlikely. \nBlack\nand Yellow Mud Dauber-\u00a0Sceliphron caementarium. \u00a0This is solitary\u00a0insects\u00a0that\nbuild nests out of mud in sheltered locations, frequently on man-made\nstructures such as bridges, barns, open porches or under the eaves of houses.\nThese nests are not aggressively defended, and stings are rare.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Black\nand Yellow Mud Dauber.\nThe black and yellow mud dauber's nest\ncomprises a series of cylindrical cells that are plastered over to form a\nsmooth nest that may attain nearly the size of a human fist.

A common species of\u00a0cuckoo wasp,\u00a0Chrysis angolensis, is\nfrequently a cleptoparasite\u00a0(steals they prey by laying its eggs\non it)in\u00a0Sceliphron\u00a0nests,\nand is only one of many different insects that parasitize these\u00a0mud daubers.\nThere are some 30 other species of\u00a0Sceliphron\u00a0that occur throughout the world,\nthough in appearance and habits they are quite similar to\u00a0S. caementarium.\u00a0S. caementarium\u00a0is widespread in\u00a0Canada,\nthe\u00a0United States,\u00a0Central\nAmerica, South Africa and the\u00a0West\nIndies, and has been introduced to many\u00a0Pacific\nIslands\u00a0(including\u00a0Australia,\u00a0Hawaii\u00a0andJapan),\u00a0Peru\u00a0and\u00a0Europe\u00a0[2],\nwhere it has become established in the western\u00a0Mediterranean Basin.\nIt was speculated that a black and yellow\nmud dauber built a nest in one of the two\u00a0 tubes\u00a0of\na\u00a0Birgenair\u00a0Boeing\n757-200, resulting in the\u00a0crash\u00a0of\nthe airplane.\nOrgan Pipe\u00a0Mud Dauber-Trypoxylon politum.\nThese are fairly large wasps, shiny black with pale hind\u00a0tarsi.\nMale organ pipe mud daubers are among the few male wasps of any species to stay\nat the nest. A male \"stands guard\" (to prevent theft of prey or nest\nmaterials, as well as to ward off\u00a0parasites while a female is away\ncollecting\u00a0spiders.\nMating typically occurs on her visits to the nest. They typically build their\nnests in sheltered locations, and large aggregations may form with dozens to\nhundreds of nests in a small area.\u00a0 The\nshape of their nest is the derivation of their common name.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nOrgan Pipe Mud Dauber, Nests and\nParasitized Spiders M0ved from Nest.

Stings to humans are\nvery rare, bordering on non-existent, although if squeezed, they will sting in\nself-defense. There are a great many other species in the genus\u00a0Trypoxylon\u00a0(over 700 of them worldwide), mostly\nsmaller in size and less abundant.\nSphecius\nspeciosus-Cicada Killer.\nCicada killer wasps are large, solitary\u00a0wasps.\nThe name may be applied to any species which uses\u00a0cicadas\u00a0as\nprey, though in\u00a0North America\u00a0it\nis typically applied to a single\u00a0species,\u00a0Sphecius speciosus, often simply referred to as \"The\ncicada killer\". However, since there are multiple species of related\nwasps, it is more appropriate to call it the\u00a0Eastern pr Western cicada killers.\nThese species occurs in the eastern, western and Midwest U.S. and southwards\ninto\u00a0Mexico\u00a0and\u00a0Central\nAmerica. They are so named because they hunt\u00a0cicadas\nand provision their nests with them.

The wings are brownish. Coloration may superficially\nresemble that of\u00a0yellow jackets\u00a0or\u00a0hornets.\nThe females are somewhat larger than the males, and both are among the largest\nwasps seen in the Eastern United States, their unusual size giving them a\nuniquely fearsome appearance.\u00a0European hornets\u00a0(Vespa crabro)\nare often mistaken for Eastern cicada killers.\nSolitary wasps (such as the Eastern cicada\nkiller) are very different in their behavior from the social wasps such as\u00a0hornets,\u00a0yellow\njackets, and paper\nwasps. Cicada killer females use their sting to\nparalyze their prey (cicadas)\nrather than to defend their nests. Adults feed on flower\u00a0nectar\nand other plant\u00a0sap\u00a0exudates.\nAdults emerge in summer, typically beginning around late June or early July and\ncontinuing throughout the summer months. They are present in a given area for\n60 to 75 days, until mid-September. The large females are commonly seen in\nmid-to-late summer skimming around lawns seeking good sites to dig burrows and\nsearching shrubs and trees for\u00a0cicadas.\nThe males are more often seen in groups,\nvigorously challenging one another for position on the breeding aggregation\nfrom which they emerged, and generally pursuing anything that moves or flies\nwithin close proximity. It is not unusual to see two or three male wasps locked\ntogether in midair combat, the aggregate adopting an erratic and uncontrolled\nflight path until one of the wasps breaks away. The male wasp's aggressive\nbehavior is extremely similar to that of another robust insect of the area, the\nmale\u00a0carpenter bee.\nIn both cases, while the males' vigorous territorial defense can be extremely\nfrightening and intimidating to human passersby, the males pose no danger\nwhatsoever. They will only grapple with other insects, and cannot sting.\nThis ground-burrowing wasp may be found in\nwell-drained, sandy soils to loose clay in bare or grass-covered banks, berms\nand hills as well as next to raised sidewalks, driveways and patio slabs.\nFemales may share a burrow, digging their own nest cells off the main tunnel. A\nburrow is 15 to 25\u00a0cm (6 - 10\u00a0in.) deep and about 3\u00a0cm\n(1.5\u00a0in.) wide. The female dislodges the soil with her jaws and pushes\nloose soil behind her as she backs out of the burrow using her hind legs, which\nare equipped with special spines that help her push the dirt behind her. The\nexcess soil pushed out of the burrow forms a mound with a trench through it at\nthe burrow entrance. Cicada killers may nest in planters, window boxes, and\nflower beds or under shrubs, ground cover, etc. Nests often are made in the\nfull sun where vegetation is sparse.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nest\nof Cicada Killer. Image Courtesy of Chuck Holliday.\nAfter digging a nest chamber in the\nburrow, female cicada killers capture cicadas, paralyzing them with a sting;\nthe cicadas then serve as food to rear their young. After paralyzing a cicada,\nthe female wasp straddles it and takes off toward her burrow; this return\nflight to the burrow is difficult for the wasp because the cicada is often more\nthan twice her weight. After putting the cicada in the nest cell, the female\ndeposits an egg on the cicada and closes the cell with dirt. Male eggs are laid\non a single cicada but female eggs are given two or sometimes three cicadas;\nthis is because the female wasp is twice as large as the male and must have\nmore food. New nest cells are dug as necessary off the main burrow tunnel and a\nsingle burrow may eventually have 10 to 20 cells. The egg hatches in one or two\ndays, and the cicadas serve as food for the grub. The\u00a0larvae\u00a0complete\ntheir development in about 2 weeks. Overwintering occurs as a mature\u00a0larva\u00a0within\nan earth-coated\u00a0cocoon. Pupation occurs in the\nnest cell in the spring and lasts 25 to 30 days. There is only one generation\nper year and no adults overwinter.\nAlthough cicada killers are large, female\ncicada killer wasps are not aggressive and rarely sting unless they are grasped\nroughly, stepped upon with bare feet, or caught in clothing, etc. One author\nwho has been stung indicates that, for him, the stings are not much more than a\n\"pinprick\". Males aggressively defend their perching areas on nesting\nsites against rival males but they have no sting. Although they appear to\nattack anything which moves near their territories, male cicada killers are\nactually investigating anything which might be a female cicada killer ready to\nmate. Such close inspection appears to many people to be an attack, but male\nand female cicada killers don't land on people and attempt to sting. If handled\nroughly females will sting, and males will jab with a sharp spine on the tip of\ntheir abdomen. Both sexes are well equipped to bite, as they have large jaws;\nhowever, they don't appear to grasp human skin and bite. They are\nnon-aggressive towards humans and usually fly away when swatted at, instead of\nattacking. Cicada killers exert a natural control on cicada populations and\nthus may directly benefit the deciduous trees upon which their cicada prey\nfeeds.\nChrysisid Wasps.\nThese tiny wasps are characterized by their shining\u00a0coloration\u00a0made\nof iridescent blue, green, purple which are true pigments (red, brown and\nwhite) and are very rare in insects. The typical brilliance is emphasized by\nthe exoskeleton sculpture, which is carved by a complex punctuation and by\nprojections, crests and holes. In addition there is a reduction of the number\nof the external abdominal segments, the presence of 11 antennal segments and\nfor the wing veins with 5 closed cells. Some tropical species have apterous\nfemales and a body without metallic reflections.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nCuckoo Wasps.\u00a0 Images Courtsey of (left) Pollinator and\n(right) Alvesgaspar.\nCurrently about 3,000\nspecies have been described worldwide. Chrysidids are\u00a0parasitoids\nwith some species being\u00a0cleptoparasites\nmeaning they lay their eggs on host that are already parasitized by other\nwasps. In addition it is not uncommon for the newly hatched cleptoparasitic\nlarvae to attack and kill the other parasitic larvae thus leaving more food for\nthemselves\nVelvet\nAnts. Their\u00a0common\nname\u00a0velvet ants\u00a0refers\nto their dense hair which may be red, black, white, silver, or gold. They are\nknown for their extremely painful sting, facetiously said to be strong enough\nto kill a\u00a0cow,\nhence the common name cow killer\u00a0or\u00a0cow ant.\nThey invade the nests of wasps and\u00a0bees\u00a0as\ntheir exoskeleton\u00a0is very tough\nand roughly textured to protect against stings. Like related families in the\u00a0Vespoidea,\nmales have wings but females are wingless. They exhibit extreme\u00a0sexual\ndimorphism; the males and females are so different\nthat it is almost impossible to associate the two sexes of a species unless\nthey are captured while mating. In a few species the male is so much larger\nthan the female that he carries her aloft while mating, a characteristic that\nis also seen in the closely related family Tiphiidae. In all\u00a0Hymenoptera\u00a0only\nthe females sting because the stinger is a modified\u00a0ovipositor.\nLike all wasps they can sting multiple times.

A\ncomplex set of adult behavior can then occur, such as spreading dirt or\ninspecting the area, leaving the nest site inconspicuous. When the wasp larva\nhatches it begins to feed on the still-living spider. After consuming the\nedible parts of the spider, the larva spins a silk\u00a0cocoon\u00a0and\u00a0pupates\u00a0\u2013\nusually emerging as an adult the next summer. Some species lay the egg on a\nstill-active spider, where it feeds externally on\u00a0hemolymph\n(spider blood). In time, that spider will die, and the mature wasp larva will\nthen pupate.\nThey usually hunt on ground\nwith the characteristic wing flicking movement. The tarantula hawk is\nonly one of a number of related species of wasps that mainly parasitize spiders\nand in entomological terms are referred to as parasitoids.\u00a0 They typically hunt out their prey, sting and\nparalyzed them and carry them back to their nest.\u00a0 The nest is typically a hole in the ground\ninto which they insert one or more spiders upon which they subsequently lay a\nsingle egg.\u00a0 After hatching the wasp\nlarva feed on the paralyzed prey until completing development.\nTarantula Hawk-Pepsis spp. This\u00a0is\na species of\u00a0spider wasp\u00a0which\nhunts\u00a0tarantulas\u00a0as\nfood for it larvae.\nUp to two inches long with a blue-black body and bright rust-colored wings,\ntarantula hawks are among the largest of wasps. The coloring on their wings\nwarns potential predators that they are dangerous (Aposematism). Their long legs have\nhooked claws for grappling with their victims. The stinger of a female\ntarantula hawk can be up to 1/3 inch long, and delivers a sting which is rated\namong the most painful in the insect world.\nDuring the spiders\u2019 reproductive season\nmale tarantulas are usually emaciated from ignoring food\u00a0while\nsearching for females. The tarantula hawks thus prefer female\u00a0tarantulas\u00a0and\nseek them in their burrows. The females\u00a0\ncapture, sting, and paralyze the\u00a0spider,\nThen they either drag the spider\u00a0back\ninto her own burrow or transport their prey to a specially prepared\u00a0nest\u00a0where\na single egg\u00a0is\ndeposited on the\u00a0spider\u2019s\nbody, and the entrance is covered. The wasp larva, upon hatching, begins to\nsuck the juices from the still-living\u00a0spider.\nAfter the\u00a0larva\u00a0grows\na bit, it plunges into the spider's\nbody and feeds voraciously, avoiding vital\u00a0organs\u00a0for\nas long as possible to keep it fresh. After completing pupation the adult wasp\nemerges from the nest. Tarantula wasps feed primarily on nectar and other\nnatural sugary materials. The consumption of fermented\u00a0fruit\u00a0sometimes\nintoxicates them to the point that flight becomes difficult. While the wasps\ntend to be most active in daytime summer months, they avoid the very highest\u00a0temperatures.\nThe male tarantula hawk does not hunt; instead, it feeds off the flowers of\u00a0milkweeds,\nwestern\u00a0soapberry\u00a0trees,\nor\u00a0mesquite\u00a0trees.\nThe male tarantula hawk has a behavior called \"hill-topping\",\nwhere he sits atop tall plants and watches for females that are ready to\nreproduce.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tarantula\nHawk Dragging Prey to Nest and Feeding on Milkweed Nectar.\u00a0 Image Courtesy of Astrobradley (left) and Davehood\n(right).\nThe tarantula hawk is relatively docile\nand rarely stings without provocation. The sting, particularly of\u00a0Pepsis formosa,\nis among the most painful of any insect, but the intense pain only lasts for\nabout 3 minutes.[ Commenting on his own experience, one researcher\ndescribed the pain as \"\u2026immediate, excruciating pain that simply shuts\ndown one's ability to do anything, except, perhaps, scream. Mental discipline\nsimply does not work in these situations\u201d.\u00a0In\nterms of scale, the wasp's sting is rated near the top of the\u00a0Schmidt Sting Pain Index,\nsecond only to that of the\u00a0bullet ant\u00a0and\nis described by Schmidt as \"blinding, fierce [and] shockingly\nelectric\".\u00a0Because of their\nextremely large\u00a0stingers, very few animals are able\nto eat them; one of the few animals that can is the\u00a0roadrunner.\nThe\u00a0U.S. State\u00a0of\u00a0New\nMexico\u00a0chose\nthe insect in 1989 to become its official state insect. The selection of the\ninsect was prompted by a group of\u00a0Edgewood, New Mexico,\nelementary school children doing research on states which had adopted state\ninsects. They selected three insects as candidates, and mailed ballots to all\nschools for a state wide election.

These tiny\nwasps are also called\u00a0gallflies with about 1300 species\nworldwide. As indicated they are generally very small creature (1-8\nmillimeters). \nThe reproduction of the gall wasp is partly pure\ntwo-sex propagation and partly pure\u00a0parthenogenesis, in which a male is completely unnecessary. With most\nspecies, however, there is an\u00a0alternation of generations\u00a0with one two-sex generation and one\nparthenogenic generation annually. \nThe plant galls mostly develop directly after the\nfemale insect lays the eggs. The reason for gall formation is largely unknown\nbut is a result of the present of the developing gall insect; it is speculated\nthat chemical, mechanical and viruses triggers the process. The hatching larvae\nfeed within the tissue of the galls and are also well-protected from external\nenvironmental effects. The host plants and the size and shape of the galls are\nspecific to the majority of gall wasps with about 70% of the known species\nliving in various types of\u00a0oak trees. Galls\noccur on nearly all parts of trees including leaves, buds, branches, and\u00a0roots. Other\nspecies of plant where galls are commonly found include eucalyptus, rose\u00a0or\u00a0maple trees, as well as\nmany herbs.

Worldwide, there are an estimated 20,000\nspecies of bees (Michener, 2000), with approximately 4,000 species native to\nthe United State. The non-native European honey bee\u00a0(Apis mellifera)\u00a0is the most important crop pollinator\nin the United States. However, because of disease and other factors the number\nof managed honey bee hives in the United States has declined by 50 percent\nsince. During this same period, the amount of crop acreage requiring bee\npollination has continued to grow. This makes native pollinators even more\nimportant to the future of agriculture. \nNative bees provide free pollination services (as\nopposed to honey bee which are typically rented) and are often specialized for\nforaging on particular flowers, such as squash, berries or orchard crops. This\nspecialization results in more efficient pollination and the production of\nlarger and more abundant fruit from certain crops. The pollination done by\nnative bees contributes an estimated $3 billion worth of crop production\nannually to the U.S. economy.\nNative bees come in a wide range of colors and sizes,\nfrom tiny sweat bees less than a quarter of an inch long to bumble bees over an\ninch in length. Most are solitary, with each female creating and provisioning\nher nest without the support of a caste system of workers. \nAbout 70 percent of native bees excavate underground\nnests while 30 percent of bees nest in wood tunnels, usually pre-existing holes\nsuch as those made by wood-boring beetles, but some will chew out the center of\npithy twigs. In the case of both ground-nesting and wood-nesting bees, once the\nnest is complete, the mother bee generally dies. Her offspring will remain in\nthe nest, passing through the egg, larva and pupa stages before emerging as an\nadult to renew the cycle. For some species this life cycle may progress over a\nmatter of weeks, resulting in a second generation of bees in a single season. A\nfew species may remain dormant for over a year. Most solitary bees however\ncomplete this life cycle over the course of a full year.\nNative bees often only live for a few weeks as\nactively flying adults. They mate immediately upon emergence and the females\nbegin nesting. They lay relatively few eggs compared to other insects, with a\nsingle female often laying less than 50 eggs before she dies. Male bees do not\nlive long beyond mating, they do not collect pollen and have little value as pollinators.\nWhile most of these wood-nesting and ground-nesting\nbees are solitary, some are gregarious, preferring to nest near others, a\nbehavior that allows large aggregations to develop in favorable locations. Only\na few tunnel and ground-nesting bee species ever develop truly social colonies,\nand often such behavior is environmentally dependent with some bees being\nsocial in one situation and being solitary in another. The one group of\nstrictly social bees native to the United States is the group of approximately\n45 bumble bee species. \nThe two habitat components need to be close enough\ntogether so that the bees can fly between them. The flight distance of a bee\nvaries with the size of the bee. Small sweat bees and mining bees may not fly\nmore than 200 or 300 yards from nest to forage area. Large bees (bumble bees,\nfor example) can cross a mile or more of inhospitable, flower-less landscape to\nforage. But however large the bee, if it has to fly too far the effort begins\nto outweigh the benefits and the bee may either find somewhere else to nest or\nnot survive in the landscape.\nA third factor that influences habitat is insecticide\nexposure. To thrive, bees need minimal exposure to pesticides.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Apidae\n\u00a0\nThe\nApidae are a large family of bees, comprising the\ncommon honey bees, stingless bees (which are also cultured\nfor honey), carpenter bees,\norchid bees, cuckoo bees, bumblebees, and various other less\nwell-known groups. The family Apidae presently includes all the genera that\nwere previously classified in the families Anthophoridae and Ctenoplectridae, and most of these are\nsolitary species, though a few are also cleptoparasites. The four groups that were\nsubfamilies in the old family Apidae are presently ranked as tribes within the\nsubfamily Apinae. This trend has been taken to its\nextreme in a few recent classifications that place all the existing bee\nfamilies together under the name \"Apidae\" (or, alternatively, the\nnon-Linnaean clade \"Anthophila\"),\nbut this is not a widely-accepted practice.\nStingless Bees.\u00a0\nThese can be found in most tropical or subtropical regions of the world,\nsuch as Australia,\u00a0Africa,\u00a0Southeast\nAsia, Central America and parts of\u00a0Mexico\u00a0and\u00a0Brazil. The\nmajority of\u00a0native social\u00a0bees of Central and\u00a0South America\u00a0are stingless bees, although only a\nfew of them produce honey on a scale such that they are farmed by\u00a0humans. They\nare also quite diverse in\u00a0Africa\u00a0and are farmed there also; meliponine\nhoney is prized as a medicine in many African communities.\nBeing\u00a0tropical,\nstingless bees are active all year round, although they are less active in\ncooler weather. Unlike other eusocial bees, they do not sting but will defend\nby biting if their nest is disturbed. In addition, a few have mandibular\nsecretions that cause painful blisters. Despite their lack of a\u00a0sting,\nstingless bees, being social, may have very large colonies made formidable by\nway of numerous defenders.\nStingless bees usually nest in hollow trunks, tree\nbranches, underground cavities, or rock crevices but they have also been\nencountered in wall cavities, old rubbish bins, water meters, and storage\ndrums. Many\u00a0beekeepers\u00a0keep the bees in their original log\u00a0hive\u00a0or transfer them to a wooden box, as\nthis makes it easier to control the hive.\nThe bees store pollen and honey in large egg-shaped\npots made of\u00a0beeswax,\ntypically mixed with various types of plant resin (sometimes called \"propolis\").\nThese pots are often arranged around a central set of horizontal\u00a0brood combs,\nwhere the\u00a0larval\u00a0bees are raised. When the young worker\nbees emerge from their cells, they tend to remain inside the hive (much like\nhoney bees, performing different jobs. As workers age, they become guards or\nforagers. Unlike the larvae of\u00a0honey bees,\nstingless bee larvae are not fed directly by worker adults. The pollen and\nnectar are placed in a cell, an egg is laid, and the cell is sealed until the\nadult bee emerges after pupation (\"mass provisioning\"). At any one\ntime, hives can contain anywhere from 300-80,000 workers, depending on species.\nIn a simplified sense, the\u00a0sex\u00a0of each bee depends on the number of\u00a0chromosomes\u00a0it receives. Female bees have two sets\nof chromosomes (diploid)\n- one set from the\u00a0queen\u00a0and another from one of the male bees\nor\u00a0drones.\nDrones have only one set of chromosomes (haploid),\nand are the result of unfertilized eggs, though inbreeding can result in\ndiploid drones.\nUnlike true\u00a0honey bees,\nwhose female bees may become workers or queens strictly depending on what kind\nof food they receive as larvae (queens are fed\u00a0royal jelly\u00a0and workers are fed pollen), the caste\nsystem in meliponines is variable, and commonly based simply on the amount of\npollen consumed; larger amounts of pollen yield queens in the genus\u00a0Melipona.\nThere is also a genetic component however, and as much as 25% (typically 5-14%) of the female brood may be\nqueens. Queen cells in the former case can be distinguished from others by\ntheir larger size, as they are stocked with more pollen, but in the latter case\nthe cells are identical to worker cells, and scattered among the worker brood.\nWhen the new queens emerge, they typically leave to mate, and most die. \u00a0New nests are not established via\nswarms, but by a procession of workers who gradually construct a new nest at a\nsecondary location. The nest is then joined by a newly-mated queen, at which\npoint many workers take up permanent residence and help the new queen raise her\nown workers. If a ruling queen is herself weak or dying, then a new queen can\nreplace her. For\u00a0Plebeia quadripunctata, although less\nthan 1% of female worker cells produce dwarf queens, they comprise six out of\nseven queen bees, and one out of five proceed to head colonies of their own.\nThey are reproductively active but less fecund than large queens. \nMyan Stingless Bees-Melipona beecheii\u00a0and\u00a0Meliopons. yucatanica,\nThese\u00a0are the only native bees cultured to any degree in the Americas. They were\nextensively cultured by the\u00a0Maya\u00a0for honey, and regarded as sacred.\nThese bees are endangered due to massive deforestation, altered\u00a0agricultural\u00a0practices (especially\u00a0insecticides),\nand changing beekeeping practices with the arrival of the\u00a0Africanized honey bee, which produces much\ngreater honey crops.\nThese bees have been\nkept by the lowland\u00a0Maya\u00a0for thousands of years. The\ntraditional Mayan name for this bee is Xunan kab, literally meaning \"royal\nlady\". The bees were once the subject of religious ceremonies and were a\nsymbol of the bee-god\u00a0Ah-Muzen-Cab,\nwho is known from the Madrid Codex.\nThe bees were, and still are, treated as pets.\nFamilies would have one or many log-hives hanging in and around their house.\nAlthough they are stingless, the bees do bite and can leave welts similar to a\nmosquito bite. The traditional way to gather bees, still favored amongst the\nlocals, is to find a wild hive; then the branch is cut around the hive to\ncreate a portable log, enclosing the colony (Figure 37). This log is then\ncapped on both ends with another piece of wood or pottery and sealed with mud.\nThis clever method keeps the melipine bees from mixing their brood, pollen, and\nhoney in the same comb as the European bees. The brood is kept in the middle of\nthe hive, and the honey is stored in vertical \"pots\" on the outer\nedges of the hive. A temporary, replaceable cap at the end of the log allows\nfor easy access to the honey while doing minimal damage to the hive. However,\ninexperienced handlers can still do irreversible damage to a hive, causing the\nhive to swarm and abscond from the log. On the other hand, with proper\nmaintenance, hives have been recorded as lasting over 80 years, being passed\ndown through generations. In the archaeological record of Mesoamerica, stone\ndiscs have been found which are generally considered to be the caps of long-disintegrated\nlogs which once housed the beehives.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nTraditional Stingless Bee Hive.\u00a0\nImage Courtesy of en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Belize37.jpg\nBalch\u00e9, an alcohol beverage similar to\u00a0mead, was made from\nfermented honey and the bark of the leguminous Balch\u00e9 tree (Lonchocarpus violaceus),\nhence its name. It was traditionally brewed in a canoe. The drink was known to\nhave\u00a0entheogenic\u00a0properties, that is, to produce\nmystical experiences, and was consumed in medicinal and ritual practices. The\u00a0hallucinogenic\u00a0properties come from tan alkaloid in\nthe bark of the Balch\u00e9 tree, although whether the hallucinogens came from the\nbark or the honey, which beekeepers would harvest after placing the nests near\nthe trees, remains uncertain. Toxic and hallucinogenic substances can be found\nin all honey, if bees collect nectar and pollen from certain types of\nvegetation. Most likely, it is a combination of the two, since balch\u00e9 is made\nfrom both the\u00a0Melipona\u00a0honey gathered from the Balch\u00e9\nflowers, and from the bark of the tree, brewed and fermented together.\nLost-wax casting, a common metalworking method\nwhich is typically found where the inhabitants keep bees, was also utilized by\nthe Maya. The wax from\u00a0Melipona\u00a0is soft and easy to work, especially\nin the humid Mayan lowland. This allowed the Maya to create smaller works of\nart and jewelry that would be difficult to forge. It also makes use of the\nleftovers from honey extraction. If the hive was damaged beyond repair, the\nwhole of the comb could be used, thus using the entire hive. With experienced\nkeepers, though, only the honey pot could be removed, the honey extracted, and\nthe wax used for casting or other purposes.\nThe outlook for meliponines in Mesoamerica is grim.\nThe number of active\u00a0Melipona\u00a0beekeepers is rapidly declining in\nfavor of the more economical, non-indigenous Africanized\u00a0Apis\nmellifera. The high honey yield, 100 kilograms or more annually,\nalong with the ease of hive care and ability to create new hives from existing\nstock, commonly outweighs the negative consequences of \"killer bee\"\nhive maintenance. Furthermore, there are flora that the\u00a0Africanized honey bees\u00a0do not visit, such as those in the\u00a0tomato family,\nand several forest trees and shrubs, which rely on the native stingless bees\nfor pollination. There has already been a decline in populations of native\nflora in areas where stingless bees have been displaced by Africanized honey\nbees. An additional blow to the art of meliponine beekeeping is that many of\nthe meliponine beekeepers are now elderly men and women, whose hives may not be\ncared for once they die. The hives are considered similar to an old family\ncollection, to be parted out once the collector dies or to be buried in whole\nor part along with the beekeeper upon death. In fact, a survey of a\nonce-popular area of the Mayan lowlands shows the rapid decline of beekeepers,\ndown to around 70 in 2004 from thousands in the late 1980s. It is traditional\nin the Mayan lowlands that the hive itself or parts of the hive be buried along\nwith the beekeeper to\u00a0volar al\ncielo, \"to fly to heaven\". There are conservation efforts\nunderway in several parts of Mesoamerica. \nSouth American Stingless Bee-Trigona spinipes. This\u00a0is a species\nof\u00a0stingless bee\noccurring in South America where it is called\u00a0arapu\u00e1, irapu\u00e1\u00a0or\u00a0abelha-cachorro\u00a0(\"dog-bee\")\n(Figure 38.). The species name means \"spiny feet\" in\u00a0Latin. Trigona spinipes\u00a0builds its nest on trees (or on\nbuildings and other human structures), out of mud, resin, wax, and assorted\ndebris, including dung. Therefore, its honey is not especially fit for\nconsumption, even though it is reputed to be of good quality by itself, and is\nused in folk medicine. Colonies may have from 5000 to over 100 000 workers. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Adult and Nest of South American Stingless Bees.\u00a0 Images Courtesy of Reynaldo\u00a0 and (Left) Jorge Stolfi\nThis species will attack in swarms when they feel the\nnest is threatened. They cannot sting, and their bite is not very effective but\nquite annoying. Their main weapon against predatory animals (including people)\nis to get themselves entangled in the victim's hair and buzz loudly. These bees\nuses odor trails, sometimes extending to several hundred yards in order lead nest mates from the\nhive to a food source. Moreover they will frequently follow trail similar\nchemicals used by other bee (such as\u00a0carpenter\nbees,\u00a0Africanized honeybees\u00a0and other stingless bees) for the same\npurpose, frequently killing or driving them away and taking over their food\nsource.\nThis bee has been considered an agricultural pest for\nsome cultures, such as\u00a0passion fruit,\nbecause it damages leaves and flowers while collecting nest materials, and\ntunnels through the unopened flowers to collect the nectar (thus frustrating\ntheir normal pollinators).[ On the other hand, they are significant\npollinators on their own, e.g. for\u00a0onions.\nAttack by stingless bee although not considered\ndangerous to humans can be very annoying if not scary, especially if the victim\nis not expecting it.\u00a0 On one occasion Pat\n(my wife) and I were collecting insects in Monte Verde Costa Rica.\u00a0 Without any warning there were hundreds of\nbees on us. As indicated above they got into our clothing and hair.\u00a0 As indicated their bite was not especially\npainful but when hundreds of bees are biting you especially around the face\nneck and other areas of the face it can be disconcerting to say the least. She\nstill talks about it today (30 years ago).\nCarpenter Bees.\u00a0 Carpenter bees are large, hairy bees with over 500\nspecies distributed worldwide.\u00a0Their\nname comes from the fact that nearly all species build their nests in burrows\nin dead wood, bamboo, or structural timbers.\nIn the\u00a0United States,\nthere are two eastern species, Xylocopa virginica, and\u00a0Xylocopa micans, and\nthree other species that are primarily western in distribution,\u00a0Xylocopa varipuncta,\u00a0Xylocopa\ntabaniformis orpifex\u00a0and\u00a0Xylocopa californica.\u00a0X. virginica\u00a0is by far the more widely distributed\nspecies. \u00a0Some are\noften mistaken for a bumblebee\u00a0species,\nas they can be similar in size and coloration, though most carpenter bees have\na shiny abdomen, while in bumblebees the abdomen is completely clothed with\ndense hair. Males of some species have a white or yellow face, where the\nfemales do not; males also often have much larger eyes than the females, which\nrelates to their mating behavior. Male bees are often seen hovering near nests,\nand will approach nearby animals. However, males are harmless since they do not\nhave a stinger.[3]\u00a0Female carpenter bees are capable of\nstinging, but they are docile and rarely sting unless caught in the hand or\notherwise directly provoked. \n\u00a0Many\u00a0Old World\u00a0carpenter bees have a special\npouch-like structure on the inside of their thorax called the\u00a0acarinarium\nwhere certain species of\u00a0mites\u00a0(Dinogamasus\u00a0spp.) reside. The exact nature of the\nrelationship is not fully understood, though in other bees that carry mites\nwhere the mites are beneficial, feeding either on\u00a0fungi\u00a0in the nest, or on other, harmful\nmites.\nCarpenter bees are traditionally considered solitary\nbees, though some species have simple social nests in which mothers and\ndaughters may cohabit. However, even solitary species tend to be\ngregarious.\u00a0 There are two very different\u00a0mating\nsystems\u00a0that appear to be common in carpenter bees, and often\nthis can be determined simply by examining specimens of the males of any given\nspecies. Species in which the males have large eyes are characterized by a\nmating system where the males either search for females by patrolling, or by\nhovering and waiting for passing females, whom they then pursue. In the other\ntype of mating system, the males often have very small heads, but there is a\nlarge, hypertrophied\u00a0glandular\u00a0reservoir\nin the\u00a0mesosoma, which releases\u00a0pheromones\u00a0into the\nairstream behind the male while it flies or hovers. The pheromone advertises\nthe presence of the male to females.[\n\u00a0These bees come in a variety of sizes although\nmost are slightly larger than a honey bee.\u00a0\nOne of the most common species is the valley carpenter bee that is\ncharacterized by solid black females and golden males. They are as large as or\nlarger than bumblebees. \n\nFemale and Male Valley Carpenter\u00a0 Bees.\n\u00a0\nAs previous indicated these bees nest in wood.\u00a0 Their colonies consist of a series of\ntunnel-shaped burrows.\u00a0 As do other bees,\ncarpenter bees collect pollen to feed to their young.\u00a0 Once collected, the pollen is formed into a\nball about the size of a small marble. A single egg is then deposited on each\nball, which subsequently is compartmentalized within the burrows (Figure\n40).\u00a0 Their life cycle is completed in a\nfew months as the larvae develop on the pollen balls.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A\nTunnel of a Carpenter Bee with Developing Larva and Pupa.\u00a0 Image Courtesy Univar Corporation.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Carpenter bees\nare not true social insects as there is no division of labor, but many bees may\noccupy the same nesting burrow.\u00a0 The\nburrows typically are used year after year and can become rather\nextensive.\u00a0 Even though these are wood\ninfesting insects, rarely do they do any significant damage to homes.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Occasionally\nthey can be bothersome to the homeowner because the males are especially\naggressive and will fly up to and buzz in a person\u2019s face; however, they are\ntotally harmless, as male Hymenoptera do not have stingers.\u00a0 The sting of the female is quite painful, but\nshe is much less aggressive.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 In the\ntelephone industry these bees are referred to as pole bees because they\nfrequently nests in telephone poles.\u00a0\nEven though they typically do not sting, they buzz linemen and in some\ncases this has resulted in injuries as a result of the workers\u2019 attempts to\navoid their harassment.\u00a0 I am aware of\nmore than one case where linemen have fallen from poles due to \u201cbee attack\u201d.\n\u00a0\nBumble Bees. A\u00a0bumblebee\u00a0(or\u00a0bumble bee) is any member of the\u00a0bee\u00a0genus\u00a0Bombus, in the family\u00a0Apidae.\nThere are over 250 known species, existing primarily in the\u00a0Northern Hemisphere\u00a0although they are common in\u00a0New Zealand\u00a0and\u00a0Tasmania.\nBumblebees are\u00a0social\u00a0insects that are characterized by\nblack and yellow body hairs, often in bands. However, some species have orange\nor red on their bodies, or may be entirely black (Figure 41).\u00a0Another obvious (but not unique)\ncharacteristic is the soft nature of the hair (long, branched\u00a0setae), called pile, that\ncovers their entire body, making them appear and feel fuzzy. They are best\ndistinguished from similarly large, fuzzy bees by the form of the female hind\nleg, which is modified to form\u00a0 a shiny\nconcave surface that is bare, but surrounded by a fringe of hairs used to\ntransport\u00a0pollen\u00a0(in similar bees, the hind leg is\ncompletely hairy, and pollen grains are wedged into the hairs for transport).\nLike their relatives the\u00a0honey bees,\nbumblebees feed on\u00a0nectar\u00a0and gather pollen to feed their young.\nOne characteristic of bees in general is that the body hairs are profusely\nbranched making them more efficient in trapping pollen.\u00a0 Their mouthparts consist of a tube-like proboscis\nfor siphoning the nectar from pants.\u00a0 It\nis coiled up when not in use.\n\n\u00a0A Bumbles Bee with Uncoiled Proboscis in Preparation for\nRemoval of Nectar.\u00a0 Image Courtesy FFubs.\nRight. Bumblebee with Pollen Trapped on Hairs.\u00a0\nImage Courtesy of Jesse Hickman\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe brightly-colored\u00a0pile\u00a0of the bumble bee is a form of\u00a0aposematic\u00a0signal, meaning the bright coloration\nis a sign that I am bad-don\u2019t mess with me\u00a0\n(Figure 42). Depending on the species these colors can range from\nentirely black, to bright yellow, red, orange, white, and pink. Thick pile can\nalso act as insulation to keep the bee warm in cold weather. Further, when\nflying a bee builds up an electrostatic charge, and as flowers are usually well\ngrounded, pollen is attracted to the bee's pile when it lands. When a pollen\ncovered bee enters a flower, the charged pollen is preferentially attracted to\nthe\u00a0stigma\u00a0(female part of plant-thus fertilization\noccurs) because it is better grounded than the other parts of the\nflower. \n\n\u00a0Brightly Colored Bumble Bee.\u00a0 Image Courtesy Christian Sand.\nBumblebees are typically found in higher\u00a0latitudes\u00a0and or high\u00a0altitudes;\nthough exceptions exist (there are a few lowland\u00a0tropical\u00a0species).\u00a0A few species range into very cold\nclimates where other bees might not be found;\u00a0Bombus.\npolaris\u00a0can be found in\nnorthern\u00a0Ellesmere\nIsland (west of Greenland)\u2014the northern most occurrence of any\u00a0true social\u00a0insect. \u00a0One reason for this is that bumblebees\ncan regulate their\u00a0body\ntemperature, via\u00a0solar\nradiation, internal mechanisms of \"shivering\" and cooling\nfrom the abdomen (called\u00a0heterothermy).\n\nBumblebee colonies are usually much less extensive\nthan those of honey bees. This is due to a number of factors including: the\nsmall physical size of the nest cavity, a single female is responsible for the\ninitial construction and reproduction that happens within the nest, and the\nrestriction of the colony to a single season (in most species). Often, mature\nbumblebee nests will hold fewer than 50 individuals and are typically found\nbelow ground (Figure 43).\u00a0 They sometimes\nconstruct a wax canopy over the top of their nest for protection from moisture\nand insulation. Bumblebees do not often preserve their nests through the\nwinter, though some tropical species live in their nests for several years (and\ntheir colonies can grow quite large, depending on the size of the nest cavity).\nIn temperate species, the last generation of summer includes a number of\u00a0queens\u00a0who\u00a0overwinter\u00a0separately in protected spots. \n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Bumblebees Nest in a Shed. Image Courtesy Pete Griggs.\nBumblebee nests are first constructed by over-wintered\nqueens in the spring. Upon emerging from\u00a0hibernation,\nthe queen collects pollen and nectar from flowers and searches for a suitable\nnest site. The characteristics of the nest site vary among species, with some\npreferring to nest in underground holes and others in tussock grass or directly\non the ground. Once the queen has found a site, she prepares wax pots to store\nfood and wax cells into which eggs are laid. These eggs then hatch into\u00a0larvae, which cause the\nwax cells to expand into a clump of brood cells.\nThese larvae need to be fed both nectar for\u00a0carbohydrates\u00a0and protein\u00a0in order to develop. Bumblebees feed\nnectar to the larvae by chewing a small hole in the brood cell into which\nnectar is regurgitated. Larvae are fed pollen in one of two ways, depending on\nthe species. So called \"pocket-maker\" bumblebees create pockets of\npollen at the base of the brood cell clump from which the larvae can feed themselves.\nConversely, \"pollen-storers\" store pollen in separate wax pots and\nfeed it to the larvae in the same fashion as nectar.\u00a0Bumble bees are incapable of\u00a0trophallaxis\u00a0(direct transfer of food from one bee\nto another) which is common in other hymenoptera such as ants.\nAfter the emergence of the first or second group of\nworkers, workers take over the task of foraging and the queen spends most of\nher time laying eggs and caring for larvae. The colony grows progressively\nlarger and at some point will begin to produce males and new queens. The point\nat which this occurs varies among species and is heavily dependent on resource\navailability and environmental factors. Unlike the workers of more advanced\u00a0social\ninsects, bumblebee workers are not physically reproductively sterile\nand are able to lay\u00a0haploid\u00a0eggs that develop into viable male\nbumble bees. Only fertilized queens can lay\u00a0diploid\u00a0eggs that mature into workers and new\nqueens.\nEarly in the colony cycle, the queen bumblebee\ncompensates for potential reproductive competition from workers by suppressing\ntheir egg-laying by way of physical aggression and pheromonal signals. Thus,\nthe queen will usually be the mother of all of the first males laid. Workers\neventually begin to lay males later in the season when the queen's ability to\nsuppress their reproduction diminishes. The reproductive\u00a0competition\u00a0between workers and the queen is one\nreason that bumble bees are considered \"primitively\u00a0social\ninsects\".\nNew queens and males leave the colony after\nmaturation. Males in particular are forcibly driven out by the workers. Away\nfrom the colony, the new queens and males live off nectar and pollen and spend\nthe night on flowers or in holes. The queens are eventually mated (often more\nthan once) and search for a suitable location for\u00a0diapause\n(dormancy). The following season they will form new colonies.\nBumblebees generally visit flowers exhibiting the bee\u00a0pollination syndrome. They can visit\npatches of flowers up to 1-2 kilometers from their colony. \u00a0Bumblebees will also tend to visit the\nsame patches of flowers every day, as long as nectar and pollen continue to be\navailable.\u00a0While foraging,\nbumblebees can reach ground speeds of up to 15 m/s (54 km/h). \nWhen bumblebees arrive at a flower, they extract\nnectar using their long tongue.\u00a0 Many\nspecies of bumblebee also exhibit what is known as \"nectar robbing\":\ninstead of inserting the mouthparts into the flower normally, these bees bite\ndirectly through the base of the\u00a0flower\nto extract nectar, avoiding pollen transfer.\u00a0These\nbees obtain pollen from other species of flowers that they \u201clegitimately\u201d\nvisit.\nPollen is removed from flowers deliberately or\nincidentally by bumblebees. Incidental removal occurs when bumblebees come in\ncontact with the\u00a0anthers\u00a0of a flower while collecting nectar.\nThe bumblebee's body hairs receive a dusting of pollen from the anthers which\nis then groomed into the\u00a0pollen\nbaskets. \nBumblebees are also capable of\u00a0pollination. With certain species of\nplants it I difficult to remove the pollen from the anthers. In order to release the pollen,\u00a0bumblebees\u00a0and some\nspecies of solitary bees are able to grab onto the flower and move their flight\nmuscles rapidly, causing the flower and anthers to vibrate, dislodging pollen.\nThis\u00a0resonant\nvibration\u00a0is called\u00a0buzz pollination. The\u00a0honeybee\u00a0rarely\nperforms buzz pollination. About 8% of the flowers of the world are primarily\npollinated using buzz pollination. This behavior is very important for\nsome plants such as blueberries, cranberries, tomatoes and peppers, all of\nwhich release pollen from pores within the anthers (similar to salt being\nshaken from a salt shaker).\nIn at least a few species, once a bumblebee has\nvisited a flower, it leaves a scent mark on the flower. This scent mark deters\nvisitation of the flower by other bumblebees until the scent degrades wears\noff.\u00a0It has been shown that this\nscent mark is a general chemical bouquet that bumblebees leave behind in\ndifferent locations (e.g. nest, neutral, and food sites)\u00a0and they learn to use this bouquet to\nidentify both rewarding and unrewarding flowers.\u00a0In addition, bumblebees rely on this\nchemical bouquet more when the flower has a high handling time (i.e. it takes a\nlonger time for the bee to find the nectar).\nOnce they have collected nectar and pollen, bumblebees\nreturn to the nest and deposit the harvested nectar and pollen into brood\ncells, or into\u00a0wax\u00a0cells for storage. Unlike honey bees,\nbumblebees only store a few days' worth of food and so are much more vulnerable\nto food shortages.\nProviding Nest Locations for Bumble Bees. Unlike\nsolitary bees, which can be very particular about tunnel diameters, bumble bees\nare flexible in their nesting needs. All they want is a warm, dry cavity,\nroughly the size of a shoebox (Figure 44). Artificial nests can be constructed\nto attract bumble bees, but occupancy is typically extremely low \u2013 often far less\nthan 25 percent.\nA simple wooden bumble bee box can be made from\npreservative-free lumber. An appropriate size will have internal dimensions of\nabout 7 inches high by 7 inches wide and 7 inches long. Drill a few ventilation\nholes on the upper sides of the box (near the roof) and cover with window\nscreen to deter ants. Also drill some drainage holes in the bottom. Make an\nentrance tunnel from 3/4-inch diameter plastic pipe and fill the box with soft\nbedding material, such as short lengths of soft unraveled string, dry straw or\nupholsterer's cotton (do not use cotton balls, as the fibers become tangled in\nthe bees' legs).

Nesting boxes\nthat are at ground level or slightly buried (either with soil or straw) are the\nmost attractive to queens of many species. Boxes placed on the surface should\nbe level and stable. If you are burying your box, extend the entrance pipe so\nit gently slopes up to the surface and clear the vegetation from an area a few inches\naround where the pipe surfaces.\nThe best time to install a bumble bee nest box is in\nearly spring, when the first queens have emerged from hibernation and are\nsearching for a nest site; in many areas, this is when the willows first start\nblooming.\nBumble bee nests require little maintenance. Watch\nyour boxes through the spring and early summer. Any above-ground boxes that are\nunoccupied by late July can be removed, cleaned and put into storage until the\nfollowing spring. This is not vital, and if you have a lot of boxes on a large\nsite it may not be practical. In late fall or early winter inspect all the\nboxes that have been occupied. Remove the old nests, clean them and make any\nrepairs. Cleaning the boxes with a bleach-water solution (1:2 ratios) will help\nreduce parasites and diseases in the nests. The following spring, add fresh\nnesting material to all the boxes.\nThe package bumble bee industry, which provides\nfarmers with live bumble bee colonies for crop pollination, currently only\nproduces a single eastern bumble bee species, Bombs impatiens. This\nspecies is then shipped nationwide, in a situation similar to the blue orchard\nbee, often far beyond its native range. Many bumble bee scientists now believe\nthat these commercially produced bumble bees are responsible for the\nintroduction of one or more diseases which have decimated several bumble bee\nspecies, even causing the potential extinction of one species,\u00a0Bombus franklini\u00a0(Franklin's bumble bee).\nThere is an enormous need for managed agricultural\npollinators in this country, but it critical not to import non-local bees,\nespecially near wild areas, even if the bees are represented as being the same\nspecies as local bees. The alternatives are to either develop local commercial\nsources of bees that are native to your region or to rear already widely\nestablished non-native species, such as honey bees or the alfalfa leafcutter\nbee, as managed pollinators.\nCuckoo bumblebees are a few species of bees which live\u00a0parasitically\u00a0in the colonies of other bumblebees\nand have lost the ability to collect pollen (Figure 45).. Before finding and\ninvading a host colony, a\u00a0Psithyrus\u00a0female (there is no caste system in\nthese species) will feed directly from flowers. Once she has infiltrated a host\ncolony, the\u00a0Psithyrus\u00a0female will kill or subdue the queen\nof that colony and forcibly (using\u00a0pheromones\u00a0and/or physical attacks)\n\"enslave\" the workers of that colony to feed her and her young. This\nfemale\u00a0also has a number of\nadaptations, such as larger mandibles and a larger venom sac that increase her\nchances of taking over a nest.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nCuckoo Bumblebee.\u00a0 Image Courtesy of Alvesgaspar.\nQueen and worker bumblebees can\u00a0sting,\nbut unlike a\u00a0honey bees,\na bumblebee's stinger lacks barbs, so they can sting more than once.\u00a0Bumblebee species are normally\nnon-aggressive, but will sting in defense of their nest, or if harmed. Female\ncuckoo bumblebees will aggressively attack host colony members, and sting the\nhost queen, but will ignore other animals (including humans) unless\ndisturbed.\u00a0 Based on my numerous\nencounters the sting of the bumble bees is considerably more painful than that\nof a honey bee.\nBumblebees are important\u00a0pollinators\u00a0of both\u00a0crops\u00a0and\u00a0wildflowers.\nBumblebees are increasingly cultured for agricultural use as pollinators\nbecause they can pollinate plant species that other pollinators cannot by using\na technique known as buzz pollination. For example, bumblebee colonies are\noften emplaced in\u00a0greenhouse\u00a0tomato\u00a0production, because the frequency of\nbuzzing that a bumblebee exhibits effectively releases tomato pollen which is\nnormally wind pollinated and therefore difficult to release from the anther.\u00a0 \nBumblebees are in danger in many developed countries\ndue to\u00a0habitat destruction\u00a0and collateral\u00a0pesticide\u00a0damage. In\u00a0Britain,\nuntil relatively recently, 19 species of native true bumblebee were recognized\nalong with six species of cuckoo bumblebees. Of these, three have become\u00a0extinct,\u00a0eight are in\u00a0serious decline, and only six remain\nwidespread. Similar declines in bumblebees have been reported in Ireland, with\n4 species being designated\u00a0Endangered, another two species considered\u00a0Vulnerable\u00a0to\nextinction.\u00a0A decline in\nbumblebee numbers could cause large-scale sweeping changes to the countryside,\nleading to inadequate pollination of certain plants. The world's first\nbumblebee sanctuary was established at Vane Farm in the Loch Leven National\nNature Reserve in Scotland in 2008. \nOne common, yet incorrect, assumption is that the\u00a0buzzing\u00a0sound of bees is caused by the beating\nof their wings. The sound is actually the result of the bee vibrating its\nflight\u00a0muscles, and\nthis can be achieved while the muscles are decoupled from the wings\u2014a feature\nknown in bees but not other insects. This is especially pronounced in\nbumblebees, as they must warm up their bodies considerably to get airborne at\nlow ambient temperatures. \u00a0Bumblebees\nhave been known to reach an internal thoracic temperature of 30\u00a0\u00b0C\n(86\u00a0\u00b0F) using this method.\nThe orchestral interlude \"Flight of the Bumblebee\" was composed\nby\u00a0Rimsky\nKorsakov\u00a0to represent\nthe turning of Prince Guidon to visit his father, Tsar Saltan, in the opera\u00a0The Tale of Tsar Saltan,\u00a0however the music is considered to\nmore accurately reflect the flight of a\u00a0bluebottle\nfly\u00a0rather than a\nbumblebee.\u00a0 \nThe music went on to inspire\u00a0Walt Disney\u00a0to have a bumblebee featured in his\nmusical\u00a0Fantasia\u00a0and also sound as if it was flying in\nall parts of the theatre - the unsuccessful experimentation led to the music\nbeing excluded from the film and the eventual invention of\u00a0surround\nsound. \nSalvador Dali\u00a0was\ninspired by the sound of a bumblebee to create one of his paintings\u00a0Dream Caused by the Flight of a\nBumble bee around a Pomegranate a Second before Awakening.\nOrchid\nBees.\u00a0 Euglossine bees, also\ncalled\u00a0orchid bees, are the only group of\u00a0corbiculate\u00a0bees whose non-parasitic members do\nnot all possess\u00a0eusocial\nbehavior. Most of the species are solitary, though a few are\ncommunal, or exhibit simple forms of eusociality.\u00a0There are about 200 described species,\ndistributed in five genera:\u00a0Euglossa,\u00a0Eulaema,\u00a0Eufriesea,\u00a0Exaerete\u00a0and the monotypic\u00a0Aglae,\nall exclusively occurring in South or Central America (though one species, Euglossa viridissima,\nhas become established in the\u00a0United States).\nThe latter two genera are cleptoparasites\u00a0in the nests of other orchid bees.

The behavior of volatile collection is essentially\nunique in the animal kingdom. Single synthetic compounds are commonly used as\nbait to attract and collect males for study, and include many familiar flavorings\nand odors considered appealing to humans (e.g.,\u00a0methyl\nsalicylate,\u00a0eugenol,\u00a0cineole,\u00a0benzyl\nacetate, methyl benzoate,\u00a0methyl\ncinnamate), and others which are not (e.g.,\u00a0skatole).\u00a0 \nNeotropical orchids themselves often exhibit elaborate\nadaptations involving highly specific placement of pollen packets (pollinia)\non the bodies of the male orchid bees; the specificity of their placement\nensures that\u00a0cross-pollination\u00a0only occurs between orchids of the\nsame species. Different orchid bee males are attracted to different chemicals,\nso there is also some specificity regarding which orchid bees visit which types\nof orchid. The early description of this pollination system was by\u00a0Charles\nDarwin, though at the time, he believed the bees were females.\u00a0Not all orchids utilize euglossines as\npollen vectors, of course; among the other types of insects exploited are other\ntypes of bees, wasps, flies, ants, and moths.\nThe male\u00a0Eufriesea\u00a0purpurata\u00a0is highly unusual in actively\ncollecting the\u00a0insecticide\u00a0DDT\u00a0in huge amounts from houses in\u00a0Brazil, without\nsuffering any harm from it.\nDigger Bees.

Nearly all\nspecies make nests in the soil, either in banks or in flat ground; the larvae\ndevelop in cells with waterproof linings and do not spin\u00a0cocoons.\nSpecies in this tribe are often referred to as \"digger bees\", though this common name is sometimes applied to\nmembers of the tribe\u00a0Centridini,\nas well (Figure 48).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nDigger Bee,\u00a0 Image Courtesy of\nentomart.\nThe characters used to define this group are subtle,\nbut they are nonetheless fairly recognizable; they are generally large (up to\n3\u00a0cm), very robust, hairy bees, with visibly protruding faces, and the\napical portion of the wings are studded with microscopic\u00a0papillae.\nThe abdomen is often banded, and in many\u00a0Old World\u00a0species of\u00a0Amegilla\u00a0these bands are metallic blue. The\nwings often appear disproportionately short compared to other bees, and their\n\"buzz\" is often a high-pitched whine, as they hover and feed on\nflowers. Males commonly have pale white or yellow facial markings, and/or\npeculiarly modified leg armature and hairs.\nAttracting Digger Bees. Some digger bees nest in\ncracks or cavities in soft sandstone and dry exposed soil embankments. Some of\nthese species will excavate tunnels in cliff sides by wetting the hard soil\nsurface with water or nectar to soften it.\nTo attract these species, adobe bricks can serve as\nthe equivalent of a wooden nest block. Such bricks can sometimes be purchased,\nin which case you can increase their attractiveness to bees by drilling nesting\nholes following the size recommendations listed above for wood blocks.\nAdobe blocks can also be easily made where clay soils\nare common. To create one, half-fill a large bucket with clay soil, and then\nfill the bucket with water. Stir the mixture together to create muddy slurry\nand allow it to settle. Remove any sticks or debris floating on the surface and\nslowly pour off most of the water. Finally, pour the remaining sediment into a\nmold (such as a wooden box or small Styrofoam cooler), and allow it to dry for\nseveral days or weeks. Before it completely dries, you can make several 1-inch indentations,\nusing the diameter guidelines above, to make it more attractive to bees.\nMount the brick, either singularly or in a stack.\nAdobe will not hold up well in wet climates and many need sheltering from rain.\nYou might want to supply a shallow water source near your bricks to help bees\nexcavate their nests.\n\u00a0 Halictidae-Halictid\nBees.

They mass-provision their young by providing a mass of pollen and nectar\nformed inside a waterproof cell.\u00a0 Once an\negg is deposited on this mass the cell is sealed off.\u00a0 Thus the larva is with all the food at one\ntime that it needs for full development, as opposed to \"progressive\nprovisioning\", where a larva is fed repeatedly as it grows, as in\u00a0honey bees.\nAll adult species are\u00a0pollen\u00a0feeders and may be important\u00a0pollinators.\nSeveral genera and species of halictids are\u00a0cleptoparasites\u00a0of other bees (mostly other\nhalictids). The most well-known and common are species in the genus\u00a0Sphecodes, where the\nfemale\u00a0enters the cell with the\nprovision mass, eats the host egg, and lays an egg of her own in its place.\nHalictidae are one of the four bee families that\ncontain some species that are\u00a0crepuscular.\nThese bees are active only at dusk or in the early evening or sometimes truly\nnocturnal.

All species feed on\nnectar and pollen, but a few are\u00a0cleptoparasites\u00a0(informally called \"cuckoo bees\"),\nfeeding on pollen collected by other megachilid bees. These parasitic species\ndo not possess\u00a0 scopa and are incapable\nof collecting their own pollen. The brightly colored scopa leads to a\ncolloquial name used occasionally in North America - \"Jelly-belly bees.\"\nMegachilid bees are among the world's most efficient\u00a0pollinators\u00a0because of their energetic\nswimming-like motion in the reproductive structures of flowers, which moves\u00a0pollen, as\nneeded for\u00a0pollination.\nOne of the reasons they are efficient pollinators is their frequency of\nvisiting to plants. In actuality they are extremely inefficient at gathering pollen\nwhen compared to all other bee families. However, megachilids require on\naverage nearly ten times as many trips to flowers to gather sufficient\nresources to provision a single brood cell. Of course with more, more\npollination is accomplished.\nNorth America has many native megachilid species, but\u00a0Alfalfa leafcutter bees\u00a0(Megachile rotundata) are an\nimported\u00a0species used for pollination. The most\nsignificant native species is\u00a0Osmia\nlignaria\u00a0(the\n\"Orchard Mason Bee\" or \"Blue Orchard\nBee\"), which is sold commercially for use in orchard crop\npollination, and which can be attracted to nest in wooden blocks with holes\ndrilled in them (which are also sold commercially for this purpose).\nLeafcutter\nbees nest in soft, rotted wood; thick-stemmed, pithy plants (e.g., rose); and\nin similar materials that the bees can easily cut through and excavate. Nest\ntunnels may extend several inches deep and coarse sawdust may be deposited at\nthe entrance. This sometimes causes confusion with other wood nesting insects\nsuch as carpenter ants. However, leafcutter bees restrict their tunneling to\nsoft, rotted wood and do not cause damage to homes or other wooden structures.\nThere\nalso are concerns about leafcutter bee nesting in rose canes, excavating the\npith of pruned canes. Leafcutter bees sometimes nest in the largest diameter\nrose canes but cause little damage because they restrict tunneling to the pith\nand rarely girdle cambium. Furthermore, other insects, including various\nhunting wasps (Pemphredon species) and small carpenter bees more\ncommonly tunnel and nest in rose canes.\nAfter\nthe nest is made, the bees collect fragments of leaves to construct individual\nnest cells. The bees cut leaves in a distinctive manner, making a smooth\nsemicircular cut about 3/4 inch in diameter from the edge of leaves. Although\nthey cut many types of leaves, leafcutter bees prefer certain types, notably\nrose, green ash, lilac and Virginia creeper. This injury often is only a minor\ncuriosity. However, where leafcutter bees are abundant and concentrate on\ncultivated plantings, the removal of leaf tissues can be damaging. Serious\ndamage most often occurs in isolated rural plantings.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rose Leaf with\nDiscs Cut from Edge by Leaf Cutting Bee.\nLeafcutter\nbees do not eat the cut pieces of leaves that they remove. Instead, they carry\nthem back to the nest and use them to fashion nest cells within the previously\nconstructed tunnels. Then they provision each leaf-lined cell with a mixture of\nnectar and pollen. The female lays an egg and seals the cell, producing a\nfinished nest cell that somewhat resembles a cigar butt. A series of closely\npacked cells are produced in sequence. A finished nest tunnel may contain a\ndozen or more cells forming a tube 4 to 8 inches long. The young bees develop\nand remain within the cells, emerging the next season.\nThere are a great many parasites that act as important\nnatural enemies of leafcutter bees. As a result, leaf cutting activity may vary\nwidely from year to year. Parasitic bees and wasps, velvet ants and certain\nblister beetles are among the most important enemies of leafcutter bees and\nother solitary bees.\nAlfalfa\nLeafcutter Bee-Megachile rotundata.\u00a0 This is a\nEuropean\u00a0bee\u00a0that has been introduced to other\nregions . As a solitary bee species, it does not build colonies or store\u00a0honey, but is a very\nefficient\u00a0pollinator\u00a0of\u00a0alfalfa,\u00a0carrots\u00a0and some other vegetables.\nThe importation of the species to\u00a0North America\u00a0was to assist in the\u00a0pollination\u00a0of food crops, and it has now\nwidespread. \u00a0The\nspecies is also found in\u00a0Queensland, Australia, but not recorded in\nother states. The vernacular in Australia is\u00a0Lucerne leafcutter bee. \nFemale alfalfa leafcutter bees have stingers, but both\nsexes will use their mandibles as a defensive mechanism, usually only defending\nthemselves when squeezed or antagonized. Therefore bee suits, such as those\nrequired with honey bees, are not really necessary when dealing with these\nbees. The ratio of males to females is generally one to one.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alfalfa Leaf Cutting Bee.\u00a0 Image Courtesy of USDA.\nThis species of leafcutter bee is cultivated to\npollinate alfalfa grown for seed, a function that it does far more efficiently\nthan honeybees.

Consequently, all of the nest tunnels are a uniform size\nand depth, which may be either too large or too small for many other species.\nNest blocks with a greater diversity of hole sizes and depths are necessary to\nattract a variety of bees that are active throughout the year.\nUnder the best circumstances these nests can attract\nlarge numbers of cavity-nesting bees and boost their local populations.\nHowever, because these nests concentrate bee populations in unnaturally large\nnumbers in a small space, they can become infested with parasites and disease\nspores after several seasons.\nWithout regular sanitation or the phasing out of nest\nmaterials, these parasites and diseases threaten long-term pollinator health\nwherever they are used. Because contaminated nest blocks left unattended in the\nlandscape continue to attract wild bees from the surrounding area, they have\nthe potential to do harm. Only with proper management can these nests maintain\nhealthy bee populations indefinitely.\nAlfalfa flowers provide an example of native bee\nefficiency. The stamen (the structure holding the anthers) of alfalfa flowers\nis held under tension by two flower petals, and springs forward with force when\nreleased by a visiting bee. This triggering discourages many bees, including\nhoney bees, which learn to avoid being hit by the stamen by approaching the\nflower from behind, where they can gather nectar but not pollen. The alkali bee\u00a0(Nomia melanderi), a native\nground-nesting megachilid bee, is not discouraged by this unusual flower\nstructure and is a major pollinator of alfalfa seed in some western states. It\nhas been used as an effective pollinator of alfalfa when grown for seed in the\nwestern United States.\u00a0 In this case large\nareas of barren soil are provided for the nesting of this bee, \nMason Bees.\u00a0 These are a gentle beneficial insects that\nhas potential as a pollinator of apples, cherries, and other tree fruits. It is\nfound throughout most of North America, particularly in wooded areas but often\naround homes in towns and cities.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nMason Bees.\u00a0\nImage Courtesy of Exzellente\nBilder.\nHomeowners sometimes become concerned when they see\nthe bee entering cavities under shake siding or investigating nail holes or\nother cavities in wood during March through early June. These are not\ndestructive insects, since they do not excavate holes in the wood, though they\nwill clean out loose debris. No controls are recommended, since no damage is\ndone. To prevent the bee from nesting, holes may be filled with caulking.\nThe\nfemales use existing holes in wood for a nest. They choose holes slightly\nlarger than their body, usually 1/4 to 3/8 inches in diameter. The bees first\nplace a mud plug at the bottom of the hole, then brings in 15 to 20 loads of\nnectar and pollen which they collects from spring flowers, including apples and\nother fruits. If you watch the bees closely as they enter the nest, you can see\nthe pollen on the underside of the abdomen.\nWhen\nthe female has provided a sufficient supply of food for the larva, she lays an\negg and then seals the cell with a thin mud plug. She then provisions another\ncell, and continues in this fashion until the hole is nearly full. Finally the\nbee plasters a thick mud plug at the entrance. Some wasps and leaf-cutter bees\nalso build nests in such holes but their nests can be distinguished from the\norchard mason bee nests by characteristics of the plug. The plug of the mason\nbee is always rough while the wasp prepares a smooth plug. Leaf-cutters seal\nthe holes with chewed-up leaves.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nMason Bee Egg in Pollen Mass.\u00a0\nImage Courtesy of Red58bill\nThe\nfemale mason bee lives for about a month and can produce one or two eggs each\nday. The larva hatches from the egg after a few days and begins to eat its\nprovisions. When the pollen-nectar mass is completely eaten in about 10 days,\nthe larva spins a cocoon and pupates within the cell.\nNear\nthe end of the summer the bee transforms to the adult stage but remains in the\ncocoon throughout the winter. In the spring, when the weather has warmed up\nsufficiently, the males begin to emerge by chewing their way out of the cocoons\nand through the mud plugs. The females, which are almost always in the inner\ncells of the tunnel, emerge several days later. One or two weeks may be\nrequired for all the bees to emerge during cool weather.\nFemales\nmate soon after emerging and begin nesting in 3 to 4 days. The bees forage on a\nnumber of different flowers. In wooded areas, they seem to prefer ballhead\nwaterleaf. In urban areas, dandelion and Oregon grape are commonly visited, in\naddition to cherries and apples.\nThe\nmason bee is non-aggressive and will sting only if handled roughly or if it\nshould get trapped under clothing. It is less objectionable than the honey bee\nas a pollinator in urban areas and should be encouraged. Efforts are being made\nexperimentally to develop large populations of these bees to use as a\nsupplement to honey bees for fruit pollination, much as the alfalfa leaf\ncutting bee was developed for alfalfa seed pollination.\nPopulations\nfor pollinating around a home or commercial orchard can be developed by\nestablishing trap nests to collect the bees. Trap nests can be made by drilling\nholes 1/4 to 3/8 inches in diameter and 3 to 6 inches deep in pine or fir\n4x4's. A \"brad-point bit\" leaves a nice, smooth hole. (Figure 57)\nAlfalfa leaf cutting bee boards with hole diameters of at least 1/4 inch can\nalso be used.\u00a0 These boards are then\nattached to a house or other structure where bees have been seen. Some\nprotection from rain is desirable. Boards can also be placed on dead trees or posts\nin wooded areas near streams where there is a good supply of mud for nest\nconstruction and wild flowers on which to forage.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nPredrilled Drilled Block Infested with\u00a0 Mason Bees.\u00a0\nImage Courtesy of Red 58bill.\nBoards\nshould be positioned where they will receive morning sunlight and started in\nMarch before the bees begin nesting and remove them in early to mid-summer when\nnesting is completed. If the boards are stored outdoors over winter (under\ncover to protect them from rain and snow) the bees will usually emerge in March\nand April. They should forage for pollen during the period of cherry and apple\nbloom and afterwards, if sufficient other flowers are available to them.\nFor\nlarge populations for orchard pollination, the nests should be under humid\nrefrigeration at 35 to 40\u00b0 F. This will permit control of emergence time and\nreduce predation and parasitism by the insect enemies of the bees. Do not place\nthe nests in storage until September or October to assure complete development\nof the adults. The following spring, place the boards in the orchards in\nplywood shelters facing east to catch the morning sun. To hasten emergence,\nincubate the boards at room temperature for 24 hours before placing the bees in\nthe orchard. The boards and some new nesting material should be in place a few\ndays before apples begin to bloom, or earlier if other fruit bloom such as\ncherries, is available. Provide 500-1000 filled holes per acre. These should\ncontain 750-1000 females, assuming an average of 1 1/2 females per hole. Males\nalso visit flowers, but they do not live long and are not as effective as\npollinators. Competing flowers such as dandelions should be mowed as soon as\nthe fruit begins to bloom.\nDeveloping\nlarge populations of the bees may be a slow process under orchard conditions;\nthe short duration of bloom does not allow the bees to accomplish maximum\nreproduction. The orchard mason bee also has a tendency to fly away rather than\nusing or reusing nests in the near vicinity. However, relatively large\npopulations have been developed in 2 or 3 years in urban situations. Once\nestablished, orchard bees will nest in containers filled with large-diameter\ndrinking straws or paper tubes folded in half.\nOrchard\nMason Bee,\u00a0Osmia\nlignaria.

They remain\nnear the nesting site and wait for the females to begin their emergence, which\ncan be several days to weeks depending on the number of days of warm weather.\nThe first thing the females do is mate. A female will typically mate once,\nmaybe twice. She will be absent from the nesting site for several days while\nshe feeds and waits for her ovaries to fully mature.\nWhen a female is ready, she seeks out a suitable nest.\u00a0O. lignaria\u00a0females like to nest in narrow holes\nor tubes, though they have been found to nest inside cedar shakes and even\nkeyholes. Beekeepers put out pre-made nesting materials to entice the females\nto stay close to the orchard. Rain, wind, and free-release (the practice of\nputting loose cocoons out rather than letting them emerge in their natal nests)\ndiscourage females from selecting a nesting site near their natal nest. A\nfemale might inspect several potential nests before settling in. Once she has\nfound the right nest, she flies outside of the hole and does an in-flight\ndance. She is orienting on major visual features in order to find her nest when\nshe returns from foraging.\nO. lignaria\u00a0arrange their nest as a series of\npartitions, with one egg per partition. She begins the process by collecting\nmud and building the back wall of the first partition. Then she makes trips to\nnearby flowers. Unlike\u00a0honey bees\u00a0which visit flowers that are miles\naway, she prefers flowers that are nearest the nest. She can visit 75 flowers\nper trip, and it takes 25 trips to create a complete pollen/nectar provision.\nShe works tirelessly during the day, only stopping once the sun has gone down.\nWhen the sun rises the next morning, she will bask in its rays until she is\nwarm enough to fly. Then she continues where ever she left off the day before.\nOnce the provision is complete, she backs into the\nhole and lays an egg on top of it. She collects more mud to seal off the\npartition. The new wall also doubles as the back wall of the next cell. She\ncontinues until she has filled the nest hole.\u00a0O.\nlignara, like many insects, can select the gender of the egg they lay by fertilizing\nthe egg, or not. Unfertilized eggs are males, while fertilized eggs are\nfemales. The adult bee lays female eggs in the back of the burrow, and the male\neggs towards the front. She lays about three males to every nest hole depending\non depth.\nWhen the egg hatches, the larva consumes the food\nprovision as it goes through many changes on its way to becoming an adult. It\nwill spend most of its life alone in this dark cell made by its mother.\nOnce the female has finished the nest, she plugs the\nentrance with one thick mud wall. Then she seeks out another location for a new\nnest. She works tirelessly until she dies. An\u00a0O.\nlignaria female lives for about four to eight weeks and she can complete an\naverage of four 6-inch tubes in her lifetime, with about eight eggs per tube.\nThat's nearly 60,000 blossom visits per female. Because of this farmers have\ncultivated the insect for pollination purposes in fruit orchards.\nBy the early summer, a larva has consumed all of its\nprovisions and begins spinning a cocoon around itself and enters the\u00a0pupal\u00a0stage; the adult females die off as\nthe season progresses.\nThe young bee is now a fully developed insect and\u00a0diapauses\u00a0inside its cocoon for the duration of\nthe winter. They burn through their fat reserves to stay warm. If it stays cold\nfor too long, the bees can die of starvation. Alternatively, if the temperature\nrises too fast, they may emerge before the blossom. Farmers are known to\nexploit their emergence cycle and time their release to coincide with the first\norchard blossoms.\nCommercial Availability. Recently, many people have\nbecome interested in the blue orchard bee\u00a0(Osmia\nlignaria), also called the orchard mason bee, as a garden and orchard\npollinator. Many thousands of mason bee nesting blocks are sold each year in\nthe United States, along with hundreds of thousands of blue orchard bees. This\ninterest has greatly raised public awareness about the importance of\npollinators; however, it is important to remember that raising large numbers of\na single species (bee-ranching) is a different objective than the conservation\nof diverse species of wild pollinators.\nAs mason beekeeping has increased in popularity,\nimportant questions are being asked about the risks associated with the\nnationwide shipment of blue orchard bees by commercial producers. In fact, there\nare two distinct subspecies of the blue orchard bee:\u00a0Osmia lignaria propinqua\u00a0in western North America and\u00a0Osmia lignaria lignaria\u00a0in the east. The species is rare in\nthe Great Plains region, although some intermediate specimens have been\ncollected.\nMost commercial producers of the blue orchard bee are\nlocated in the Pacific Northwest, where they rear the locally native western\nsubspecies . Unfortunately, the bees these producers raise are then marketed\nnationwide, resulting in the frequent shipment of locally non-native bees to\nthe eastern United States. The potential ecological consequences of the western\nblue orchard bee hybridizing with its eastern subspecies are unknown.\nSimilarly, these shipments have the potential to introduce locally non-native parasites\nand diseases. For the consumer, there is another significant drawback. The\nwestern bees may not develop in sync with local conditions, resulting in poor\nestablishment and poor performance as pollinators. The net result is that\npeople purchasing blue orchard bees over the Internet or through garden\ncatalogs may be doing more to harm their local pollinator populations than to\nhelp them \u2013 and not be getting the pollination they paid for.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Colletidae-Colletid\nBees\nThis\u00a0is a\u00a0family\u00a0of\u00a0bees that are often\nreferred to collectively as\u00a0plasterer bees, due to the method of\nsmoothing the walls of their nest cells with secretions applied with their\nmouthparts; these secretions dry into a cellophane-like lining. This allows the\nbees to nest in periodically flooded areas such as stream banks. There are over\n2000species,\nall of them evidently solitary, though many nest in aggregations. Bees in this\nare highly varied in appearance and have few common features. One feature\nconsistent to all colletid bees is that their tongue has a branched tip (Figure\n59) . The two genera most frequently seen are\u00a0Colletes\u00a0and\u00a0Hylaeus.\nTwo of the subfamilies, Euryglossinae\u00a0and\u00a0Hylaeinae, lack the\nexternal pollen-carrying apparatus (the\u00a0scopa)\nthat otherwise characterizes most bees, and instead carry the pollen in their\ncrop (enlarged portion of the foregut).

The\nvariety of lifestyles displayed by ants is amazing--perhaps because so many of\ntheir social behaviors seemingly parallel our own.\nAll living ant species have a caste system. The main\ncastes consist of kings, queens and workers. The kings are winged reproductive\nmales that contribute absolutely nothing to the labor of the colony. The winged\nfemales swarm with the males, similarly to the behavior previously discussed\nwith termites. Eventually they will become the queens of new colonies. During\nthe establishment of a new colony, the new queen initially performs all the\nwork tasks; but once her first brood of worker larvae is reared to adulthood,\nher sole duty is to lay eggs. Unlike termites, ant colonies may have many\nqueens, in some cases, hundreds.\nWorkers are sterile females and can be both the\nlaborers and defenders of the colony. In most ant species there can be\nsub-castes of the workers, namely majors, media and minors. Relative head and\noverall body size distinguish subcastes. The majors are the largest of the\nthree and possess a disproportionately large head and mandibles. The function\nof the soldiers is to protect the ant colonies. The media and minor workers are\nthe most common individuals in an ant colony and perform the majority of the\nwork duties. Minor worker ants also perform a variety of functions depending on\nthe species of ant. \nAnt Wars, Competition and Survival.\u00a0 Ants are amongst the most aggressive and\nwar-like of all animals.\u00a0 If ants had a\npolicy of life it could be summarized as restless aggression, territorial\nconquest, and total annihilation of neighboring colonies.\u00a0 These insects use any of a number of strategies\nand weapons to reach these ultimate goals.\u00a0\nChemical warfare is prevalent amongst many species including spraying a\nvariety of toxic chemicals in order to repel, confuse, immobilize or even kill\ntheir rivals.\u00a0 The soldiers of many\nspecies readily assume a kamikaze role in order to \u201cwin skirmishes\u201d between\nrival colonies.\u00a0 One of the most dramatic\nof these sacrifices is exhibited by a carpenter ant from SE Asia.\u00a0 These ants act as walking bombs.\u00a0 There is a huge internal gland that occupies\nmuch of their body that is filled with toxic chemicals.\u00a0 If one of these ants is hard pressed by a\nrival ant or predator it contract some large abdominal muscles that bursts open\nthe abdomen violently (like a bomb) releasing the chemicals.\nThe availability or more significantly the limited\navailability of food frequently is important in colony survival.\u00a0 As a consequence rival colonies frequently\ndevelop strategies to maximize their collection of available food. \u00a0There is a tiny fast moving ant in the deserts\nof Arizona that utilizes toxic secretions to intimidate and confuse much large\nhoney ants (10 time their size) as they steal food from the larger ant colonies.\u00a0 In addition these tiny ants will frequently\nprevent honey ants from leaving their nests by releasing toxic chemical down\nthe hole or nest entrance thus driving the former below ground.\u00a0 This of course allows the smaller species to\nforage without competition from the honey ants.\u00a0\nAnother form of nest entrance blocking is exhibited by a small ant species\nin the southwestern deserts.\u00a0 In this\ncase they gather in mass around the nest entrance of their rivals and similarly\nrelease toxic chemicals down the entrance.\u00a0\nHowever in addition they pick up pebbles, twigs and other small objects\nand drop them down the vertical shaft entrance.\u00a0\n\nPossibly the most elaborate of all documented\naggressive strategies in social insects occurs in battles between the tiny woodland\nant and the imported fire ant.\u00a0 The fire\nants are deadly enemies of the woodland ants with colonies 100 times larger\nthan their tiny rivals.\u00a0 Even though fire\nants are much more powerful than the woodland ants both successfully survive in\nthe same area.\u00a0 The secret of woodland ant\nsurvival evolves around a specialized soldier (major) and a three-stage\nstrategy to defend against fire ant attack.\u00a0\nThese soldiers are equipped with huge heads that are equipped with large\nsharp jaws provided with massive muscles.\u00a0\nThese do not attempt to sting or spray their enemy with poisons (common\nin many ants) but quite precisely use their mandible to snip off legs, heads\nand other body parts.\u00a0 Unless attacked\nthe majors remain in the colony.\u00a0\nHowever, the minors regularly forage for food but are always on the\nalert for scout fire ants that are looking for colonies to raid.\u00a0 If a woodland ant minor encounters a fire ant\nsoldier close to its colony a violent response is triggered.\u00a0 Once detected the minor rushes to the fire\nant in a mock attack but merely touches the potential invader in order to\nacquire some of its odor.\u00a0 She then\nquickly retreats toward her nest.\u00a0 As she\nretreats she lays a pheromone trail by periodically touching her abdomen to the\nground. \u00a0On her way back she briefly rushes\nup to any other minor alerting them to the presence of the fire ant scout.\u00a0 Once in the nest soldiers plus many of the\nminors are alerted to the presence of the invader scout (by its smell on the\nminor worker) they subsequently rush in mass along the already establish\npheromone trail leading to the enemy.\u00a0\nOnce found the soldier surrounds the fire ant and attack relentlessly\nand are fully capable of destroying it due to their great superiority in\nnumbers.\u00a0 Of course the whole purpose is\nto kill the fire ant scout before it can alert other fire ants in the area as\nto the presence of a woodland ant colony.\u00a0\nOnce accomplished the soldiers search the general area for any other\nfire ant scouts.\nIf fire ants mount a full scale attack of a woodland\nant colony, the defenders have an alternate strategy. As fire ants arrive in\nfull force the entire force of woodland soldier ants are sent into the\nbattle.\u00a0 Soon the battle ground is\nlittered with the bodies of the smaller species plus a multitude of legs and\nother body parts of the fire ants.\u00a0 As the\nbattle continues any woodland ant minors still present retreat to the nest. As\nmore and more fire ants arrive and the woodland ant soldiers are greatly\nout-numbered they retreat, close ranks to form a dense protective perimeter\naround their colony entrance.\u00a0 With the\nimpending doom that the fire ants will soon break through the protective\nbarrier and ravage, steal and consume the woodland ant\u2019s eggs, larvae and pupae\nthe activity of the minors in the colonies is frantic but well programs.\u00a0 They gather the young in their mandibles and\nsprint out though the colony entrance, through the battle field and beyond to\nsafety.\u00a0 The woodland ant soldiers remain\ntrue to their programmed behavior and fight to the death. Once the fire ants\nleave the now ravaged colony the minors return with their cargo of eggs, larvae\nand pupae and reestablish colony life.\u00a0\nOver time new soldiers develop in the colony preparing for the\npossibility of another raid.\u00a0 Such is the\nlife of ants!\nSome ants survive by controlling the environment in\nwhich they live.\u00a0 In the Amazon rain\nforests there is a tremendous diversity of vegetation.\u00a0 If you walk through the forest no plant\ntypically dominates and you may not see any two plants of the same species\nwithin hundreds of yards. One notable exception is the Cordia tree.\u00a0 On occasion you\nwill find a large stands of these trees with no other plants in the\nvicinity.\u00a0 In addition these stands are\ntypically encircled by large barren strips of land.\u00a0 The reason for this phenomenon is the\npresence of a small ant species that lives within the stems of these\ntrees.\u00a0 They are very protective killing\nany plant feeding insects.\u00a0 They will\nalso swarm on and attack any larger animal venturing into the stand.\u00a0 In addition any other species of plants that\ngerminates with in the stand quickly shrivels and dies due to the ants stinging\nand injecting venom into the terminal buds.\u00a0\nAs might be expected the barren areas surrounding the stand of trees is\nsimilarly cleared by the stinging of these ants.\u00a0 Of course the ants benefit from this\nsymbiotic relationship since they are provided by a safe bountiful location for\ntheir nests.\u00a0 And of course the trees\nbenefit as they are provided with an endless competitively free environment in\nwhich to expand their growth.\u00a0 People\nliving in the rain forest refer to the barren areas as the \u201cdevil\u2019s garden\u201d and\nrefrain from planting crops there.\nHoney Ants. Ants vary\ntremendously as to their food preferences, size and colony locations. The honey\nants are among some of the more interesting species. Normally they live in arid\ndesert regions of the world; their primary diet is honeydew, which they collect\nfrom aphids and other homopterans. In such dry areas, honeydew-producing\ninsects are common during the rainy season only when host plants prevail.\nBecause in most areas this season only lasts a few months, honey ants have\ndeveloped a means of \u2018storing\u2019 honeydew from season to season. A special form\nof worker called the replete, or reservoir ant, accomplishes this. These\nrepletes are fed huge amounts of honeydew; consequently, their abdomens stretch\nto many times the normal size. Once fed, reservoir ants remain inactive and\nstore honeydew for many months. In many areas of the world, reservoir honey\nants are human\u2019s food\u2014they are collected and their abdomens are bitten off. The\nstored honeydew gives them a candy-like taste.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Honey Ants-Myrmecocystus Spp..\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Worker media and\nreplete castes of honey ants.\u00a0 Image\ncourtesy Greg Hume at Wikepedia.\n\u00a0\nColonies of these amazing insects\ndevelop specialized workers, called repletes or honeypots, with tremendously\nswollen abdomens for nectar storage. Some repletes also hoard water, fats and\nbody fluid from insect prey. The repletes ingorge on food that is collected\noutside the nest and brought to them by normally-proportioned worker ants. Deep\nin underground chambers, the repletes hang quietly in clusters, literally\nimprisoned by their abdomens ballooned to the size of small grapes (Figure\u00a0 )! \n\u00a0\nWorldwide there are several very\ndifferent kinds of ants that exhibit extreme repletism; all are properly called\nhoney ants. One outstanding group; the genus Myrmecocystus, occurs\nexclusively in western North America. Myrmecocystus contains a diverse\nensemblage of at least 28 closely related species, many of which are broadly\ndistributed. It follows that these honey ants are very common insects. Most\nhuman residents or visitors to the American Southwest have probably strolled\natop a honey ant nest completely unaware of the treasure trove hidden below.\nBut those lucky enough to view repletes first hand can't help but want to find\nout more about these astonishing creatures.\nHoney ants are highly social insects. They live in\nefficiently organized colonies or groups of cooperating individuals. Their\nsocieties are matriarchal or female-dominated families. A typical honey ant\ncolony contains a single fertile queen and thousands of sterile female workers.\nThe queen is the mother of the colony and is specialized for egg production,\nwhile the workers, the queen's daughters and hence all sisters, are responsible\nfor colony labor.\nWorker honey\nants are polymorphic, meaning that they come in different sizes, ranging\nten-fold or more in body weight. This variation, in turn, permits more\neffective task specialization. For example, the smallest workers, called\nminims, tend to remain in the nest as nursemaids caring for the queen, the\ndeveloping brood (eggs, larvae and pupae) and the repletes. Medium and larger\nsize workers are more apt to be involved with nest excavation, food acquisition\nand colony defense. The largest workers, called majors, are the individuals\nmost likely to develop into repletes. Honey ant colonies are coordinated\nlargely by pheromones, glandular secretions produced by the ants that function\nas chemical signals. Pheromones regulate complex social behavior and broadly\nserve to identify colony members, recruit nestmates to food sources, and elicit\nalarm and defensive behaviors. For example, honey ant workers instantly\ndistinguish nestmates from intruders based on their smell (colony odor); the\nformer might be groomed and offered food while the latter would be attacked and\nkilled or driven from the nest. \nHoney ant societies may also contain\nnumerous non-working reproductive forms, or winged males and virgin queens.\nWinged forms, called alates, are produced when colony populations reach an\noptimal size and become reproductively mature. Then, a portion of the brood\nraised each year is converted into individuals designed to mate, disperse and\nstart new colonies. Mating flights typically are nocturnal or crepuscular, and\ngenerally occur only once a year following the first heavy precipitation of the\nsummer rainy season.\nThe reproductive forms pour out of the\nnest and swarm into the air, mating on the fly. Young queens take only one\nmating flight; they store viable sperm long-term in a special organ, called a\nspermatheca, which is then used for fertilizing eggs throughout the remainder\nof their lives.\nThe males, their primary function\ncompleted, die shortly after mating. The inseminated queens drop to the ground,\ntwist off their now useless wings, and scamper across the surface of the warm\nwet ground, looking for a place to burrow. The vast majority of the queens fall\nvictim to a barrage of predators including birds, lizards, spiders and\nespecially, other ants. Surviving queens must be well below ground before the\nrising sun relentlessly dries and bakes the surface. The queens seal themselves\ninside humid, subterranean cavities and do not forage; rather, they rear their\nfirst brood of tiny workers, called nanitics, relying solely on their stored\nfat reserves and metabolized flight muscles. Colony growth is slow at first,\nbut soon rapidly accelerates as additional ants are added to the worker force. \n\u00a0\nHoney ant nests almost always have only\na single surface opening surrounded by a small accumulation of excavated\nsubstrate. Each species has a characteristic nest entrance. For example, M.\nmimicus builds a low sandy mound while M. mexicanus constructs a turret\nof coarse gravel. Nest openings of the latter species are very distinctive and\nnot easily confused with those built by other kinds of ants in the area. The\namount of soil surrounding a honey ant nest entrance is deceptively small, for\nthe nest tunnels and chambers frequently extend deep into the ground, often\nreaching several yards or more below the surface. Nests of M. mexicanus\nhave been studied in detail and have a surprisingly distinct and seemingly\nadaptive architecture. The nests typically are built in hard rocky soil, and\nconsist of a subsurface labyrinth of tunnels and a vertical array of small\ndomed chambers interconnected by one narrow vertical passageway. The maze of\ntunnels just below the surface probably serves as a staging area for foraging\nparties and mating flights and as a site for brood incubation. The lower\nchambers, deep enough to be within the level of permanent soil moisture, house\nthe queen, much of the worker population and the majority of repletes. The lone\ninterconnecting passage probably makes individual nest chambers easier to\ndefend or seal off from enemy invaders.\nHoney ants are generalized scavengers and predators.\nSugary carbohydrates are needed for energy. The ants visit flowers and\nextrafloral nectaries for the sweet rewards, and \"milk\" homopterans\nlike aphids and scale insects for their sugary exudations called honeydew. Once\nengorged with liquid sugar, workers return to their nest to share with other\ncolony members.\nProtein sources also are necessary, particularly for the\ngrowing larvae. Foraging honey ants search for live or recently dead\ninvertebrates, predominantly arthropods; small soft-bodied insects like\ntermites and caterpillars are especially fair game. Individual workers head\nhomeward with pieces of food clasped within their mandibles, while groups of\nworkers may cooperate when retrieving large or struggling prey items.\nLike all formicine ants, honey ants lack stingers:\nrather, they spray fine droplets of formic acid from their abdominal tip. The\ncaustic acid is used, along with pinching mandibles, to help subdue\nuncooperative prey or to deter colony enemies. Grappling with prey or facing\noff against their foes, attacking honey ants spread and brace their legs,\nrapidly curl their abdomens underneath pointing forward, aim and fire. Their\nchemical weaponry is most effective against small targets; it is useful against\nmammals or other large animals only if sprayed into highly sensitive tissues\nlike eyes or nostrils.\nGiven an abundance of sweet repletes, it\nis not surprising that badgers and other desert creatures sometimes burrow into\nand plunder honey ant nests. Even some honey ant colonies will raid one\nanother, stealing not only repletes but also brood, that when mature, is\n\"enslaved\" as part of the pirating colony's worker force.\nAs recently as early this century,\nvarious Native American tribes and Mexicans regularly excavated honey ant\ncolonies to obtain the savory morsels stockpiled therein. Sweet-toothed human\npredators typically hold a replete's head and thorax with the fingers, bite off\nor rupture the fragile abdomen, then suck its contents into the mouth. The\nso-called \"honey\" tastes somewhat like molasses, while the ants'\nbodies, being bitter, are discarded. Perhaps fortunately for honey ants, this\npractice seems to have fallen by the wayside due to the advent of commercially\navailable candies. These not only taste better but are much less work to\nprocure. \u00a0\nMany social insects, notably honey bees and some\nwasps, collect and store liquid sweets for later use. However, these insects\nstow their food within the confines of their nest combs. Honey ants are unique\nin using their own bodies as living storage vessels.\nBut why develop repletes? In arid regions, food and\nwater usually are obtainable only for very limited periods. But when available,\nas during the brief summer rainy or growing season, these resources are present\nin overwhelming abundance. Under favorable conditions, surplus food gathered by\nthe colony is fed to the repletes for long-term storage. Then, in times of\nneed, the food is regurgitated back to colony members.\nWhile the formation of food-storing repletes seems\nremarkable, it is merely an exaggerated form of typical ant behavior. Most ants\npossess expandable abdominal crops (stomachs) for temporarily carrying liquid\nfood back to the nest. When solicited by a hungry nestmate, they regurgitate\nthis liquid and offer a small droplet held between their mandibles. Close\nobservation will reveal that the donor ant's abdomen shrinks as the recipient's\nabdomen expands. Thus, the crop serves as a \"communal stomach\" and\nrepletism simply as extreme development of this expandable organ.\nIn the presence of excess food, repletes can develop\nfrom any newly emerged worker, apparently before its exoskeleton and intersegmental\nmembranes harden and become less flexible. In young colonies, it is not\nuncommon to find small workers serving as somewhat ineffective repletes, with\ntheir tiny abdomens distended to the bursting point. However, on an individual\nbasis, major workers make the most efficient honeypots. Hundreds to a thousand\nor more large repletes can be found in mature honey ant colonies, each\npatiently hanging and waiting to serve up dinner when called upon by its\nnestmates.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Argentine Ant.

Image courtesy Penarc. \nIdentification. The Argentine ant is a one node, small, shiny, brown\nant with only one size of worker.\u00a0 Workers are usually about 1/12 to 1/8\ninch long.\u00a0 The queen ants are much larger, sometimes reaching 1/4 inch in\nlength.\u00a0 They nest outdoors under logs, concrete slabs, debris and\nmulch.\u00a0 Argentine ants build very large colonies and can move\nrapidly.\u00a0 During winter months, this ant will move indoors.\nBiology. This ant is successful and hard to control because: \n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nDifferent\nArgentine ant colonies in a same general locale are not enemies.\u00a0 Even the\nmany queens in a single colony or separate colonies are friendly to each other.\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArgentine\nants are not too \"picky\" when choosing a suitable site to infest or\ncolonize.\u00a0 They readily (as you will read about in move their nests during the changing seasons and other\nconditions.\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThese pests\nare omnivorous; they seem to never be in short supply of food.\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nEach colony of\nArgentine ants contains a multitude of workers.\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nEach worker is\nmore courageous and harder worker than most ants. \u00a0 Creatures that attempt\nto prey on Argentine ants are confronted with an army of stubborn bugs that\nnever runs from a fight!\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe queens of\nmost ant species are usually egg-laying machines. \u00a0 The queen ant of\nArgentines actually helps in the care, grooming and feeding of her young.\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nMost\nspecies of ants mate and reproduce by swarming; the Argentine mates in the\ncolony, unexposed to the perils of birds, frogs, lizards, predator insects and\nextreme weather conditions.\u00a0 A swarmer reproductive (as seen with fireants and carpenter ants) has about\n1 chance in 1,000 of surviving and successfully reproducing.\u00a0 The\nArgentine ant queen always succeeds!\nDistribution. Originating\nfrom Northern Argentina near the Paran\u00e1 River and surrounding regions, the\nArgentine ant now occurs in most regions with Mediterranean climates or with\nmild winters and moderate to high humidity. Argentine ants are established in\nat least 15 countries on six continents and many oceanic islands, including New\nZealand, Japan, and Hawaii. The global distribution of Argentine ants continues\nto expand. Humans have been the primary factor in their spread, however, this\nant can also disperse into new areas without human influence. The Argentine ant\nis widely distributed in California, with highest abundance in coastal areas,\nalong rivers, and in urban settings. \nIt was discovered by scientists two years ago that native Argentine ant\n(in Argentina)colonies living in close proximity were territorial and\naggressive toward one another, literally tearing one another apart whenever\nthey came into contact. The puzzling question to the researchers was, Why\nweren\u2019t the introduced ants in California the same way? Why would an Argentine\nant from San Diego dropped into a colony in San Francisco be welcomed, while an\nArgentine ant dropped into a colony two hundred meters away in its native\ncountry be torn apart?\nIn search to the answer to that question the genetic\ndifferences among the ants in Argentina were compared with those in various\nparts of California, from San Diego to Ukiah. Using some of the same DNA\nfingerprinting techniques employed by criminologists, it was discovered that\nthe native Argentine ants were twice as diverse as the native California ants,\nexplaining why the California ants regard individuals up and down the coast as\nclose kin, while those different nearby colonies in Argentina do not. They have\nan innate ability to recognize other members of their colony based on how\ngenetically similar they are to themselves.\u00a0\nBasically the genes are similar among California ants because they are\ndescended from a relatively small founding population In essence, the super\ncolony that we see in California is in fact one big colony.\nDamage. Because it\ndoes not sting or bite the Argentine ant is not a direct threat to humans,\nunlike harvester ants or fire ants. However since there is little competition\nbetween opposing colonies of this species (one giant colony) this ant is the\ndominant species in areas where it becomes establish.\u00a0 It is very aggressive toward other species of\nants and tends to out competes and replace other ants that are found in their\nsame general area. As a result the Argentine ant is by a long way the major\nnuisance pest in urban areas, especially because of the availability of water.\nThis ant exists in back yards at high densities associated with landscape\nfeatures that provide favorable microclimates, such as potted plants and\nwalkway bricks or stones. They enter homes through cracks and other spaces, in\nsearch of food or water.\nArgentine\nants are also an economic threat because of their potential to tend plant pest\ninsects, such as mealybugs, scales, and aphids. In return for sweet honeydew\nsecretions from these plant feeding insects, ants provide protection from\nnatural enemies. Argentine ants may even move pests to better food sources or\nmore favorable microclimates to maximize honeydew production. This mutualism\ncan compromise management of pest insects by otherwise effective natural enemies,\nthrough removal or intimidation of predators and parasitoid wasps, leading to\nhigher pest densities and greater plant damage than would occur in the absence\nof Argentine ants. For example, parasitism rates of an important citrus pest,\nthe California red scale (Aonidiella\nauranti), were reduced two- to five-fold in the presence of Argentine ants.\nControl. There are\nno known specific enemies of the Argentine ant. Therefore control is primarily\nvia chemical and cultural means. Broadcast spraying of insecticides is of\nlimited value because a substantial portion of Argentine ant colonies exist\nbelow ground where insecticides are unable to penetrate. Poison bait stations\nhave proven effective at controlling Argentine ants in vineyards, though\nprolonged deployment may be required for natural enemy-mediated reductions on\nhoneydew producing pests to become apparent.

The minima are the smallest\nform of the adults and function to care for the brood (larvae and pupae) and\nfungal gardens. Media workers forage for and carry the leaf discs deep into\ntheir nests, where they are licked, cut into smaller pieces, dampened with an\nanal secretion and finally formed into a bed of moist pulp. The newly formed\nbeds are then planted with fungi from established beds. As the fungus grows, it\nis harvested and fed to the larvae. Most leaf cutting ants are quite particular\nand typically cultivate and harvest only one species of fungus. Media workers\ncontinuously \u2018weed out\u2019 any alien species of fungi that infest their gardens. It\nis believed that a few species actually produce fungicidal substances from\ntheir salivary glands, which chemically aid in the weeding process. In some\nspecies, when the swarming queens leave the colony, they carry the strands of\nfungi with them in pouches below their heads. Once new colonies are begun, the\nstrands are \u2018planted\u2019 to assure a new garden of the correct species of fungi.\u00a0 The maxima are the largest of the forms with\nenlarged heads and protruding mandible.\u00a0\nThese of course are the soldiers of the colony and function to protect\nthe colony against intruders.\nIn a few species of leaf-cutting ants, the minor caste\nperforms a rather specialized function. These smaller workers frequently\naccompany the larger foraging leaf-gatherers; they do not assist in leaf\ncutting; but ride back to the nest either on the leaf portion or on the thorax\nof the media. Their sole function is to protect the media by snapping their\nmandibles at a species of parasitic fly that attempts to lay eggs on the\nmedia\u2019s head.\nCarpenter Ants. On\noccasion, carpenter ants are confused with termites by the homeowner. These two\nare easily distinguished by any of a number of characteristics. As in all ants,\nthe abdomen is connected to the thorax by a narrow waist, or petiole, while the\nabdomen of a termite is broadly joined to the thorax. Also, in the winged\nforms, a termite\u2019s wings extend far beyond the tip of the abdomen and their\nfront and hind wings are of equal size and shape. In winged ants, the hind\nwings are much smaller than the front wings and both rarely extend beyond the\ntip of the abdomen. Many carpenter ants are large and typically black in color.\nUnlike termites, carpenter ants do not eat wood and rarely cause damage to\nstructures. In California, their nests may occur inside the wooden parts of\nhomes, but in such cases they usually have occupied abandoned drywood termite\nnests. Carpenter ants eat a variety of things, including other insects. \n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nA common carpenter ant. \nArmy Ants. The most spectacular and well-known\nants are the legionary, or army, ants of the humid tropical forests. These ants\ndo not construct nests, but form temporary clusters called bivouacs in the\nshelter of fallen trees or in other partially exposed situations. The workers\nform a solid mass up to a yard wide, which consists of layer after layer of\nindividuals hooked together by their tarsal claws. The queen, larvae, pupae,\nand eggs are located in the center of this mass.\n\n\u00a0\nAn army ant, not considered as dangerous\nto humans as commonly believed.\nThe night is passed in a tight cluster, but at the\nfirst sign of light the cluster dissipates and hoards of workers fan out from\nthe bivouac in all directions. Soon, one or more columns form and begin to\nsearch for food. The workers lay down a pheromone trail for others to follow\nwhile the soldiers guard the perimeter of the trail. Workers form numerous\ncolumns; changing positions behind the advancing hoards of ants\u2014flushing out\nlarge numbers of prey (arthropods, small reptiles and rodents). The prey is\nstung, killed and transported to the rear as food for the larvae. At the end of\nthe day the cluster is reformed. When the food supply is depleted around the\narea of the bivouac, the colony relocates.\nSome colonies of army ants may number as high as one\nmillion individuals. Because of the spectacular size of their colonies and\n\u2018raiding\u2019 nature of these insects, they have been used repeatedly by the motion\npicture industry. Actually army ants pose no threat to humans or other large\nanimals.\nThe authors recently had the opportunity to observe\narmy ant behavior in Costa Rica. One morning we were walking down a dirt road\nwith several students collecting insects. Collecting was not that good but\nsuddenly hoards of insects, spiders and even a few scorpions and lizards\nstarted pouring out from the underbrush across the road we were on. After a few\nmoments of excellent collecting, we decided to investigate the reason for this\nwindfall. And, as you might suspect, there was a column of army ants moving\nthrough a gully to the side of the road. Of course all the animals in its path\nwere attempting to flee. On the following evening a column of army ants raided the\nstudents' cabin. The students were not awakened, but the following morning they\nwere very disappointed to see that the army ants had stolen most of the several\nthousand insects they had collected and mounted on pins over the past week.\nShortly thereafter, I decided to test the reports that army ants pose no threat\nto humans. There was a column moving through our pension grounds--so I placed\nmy foot directly in their path. They merely ignored this obstacle and marched\nover and around it.\nWhile the army ants are primarily found in the New\nWorld tropics the driver ants are found in the tropics of Africa.\u00a0 Both types are very similar as far as their\nbehavior and biology is concerned.\u00a0 One\ndistinct difference is that while large colonies of army ants may number one\nmillion colonies of driver ants can reach 200 million.\u00a0 With such huge numbers they present more of a\nthreat to humans and other animals.\u00a0\nThere have been human deaths recorded from the raids of these critters\n(mostly infants).\u00a0 In these cases death\nhas typically occurred from suffocation as a result of the ants entering and\nfilling the lungs.\u00a0 \nThe mating behavior of these ants is especially\nstrange.\u00a0 The males are to drawn to the\nforaging columns supposedly looking for a mate.\u00a0\nInstead of finding a queen the sterile workers quickly swarm the males\nand immediately tear their wings off.\u00a0\nThen they carry them off and basically imprison them until a potential\nnew queen is available. \nBullet Ants. This ant is\nprimarily found in rainforests ranging from Nicaragua to Paraguay and Australia.\u00a0 This huge (1 inch) beast is called the bullet\nant because its sting feels like being shot by a bullet.\u00a0 On the Schmidt Sting Index bullet ants rate\nas the number one most painful sting found in the arthropods.\u00a0 When defending their nest they swarm out,\nrelease a strong odor and stridulate an audible sound (said to sound like a\nshriek) and then grab and impale their intruder.\u00a0 In Central-South America they are referred to\nas the 24-hour ant, referring to the pain described as \u201cof burning, throbbing,\nall consuming pain\u201d that may last a day or more.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A one-inch Costa\nRican bullet ant. \nAs with many other arthropods bullet ants play a ceremonial\nrole in some tribes of the rainforests. The Satere-Mawe people of Brazil use\nthis ant in the right of passage of boys into manhood. In this case live bullet\nants are woven into a sleeve made of leaves with the stingers pointing inward.\u00a0 Once the sleeve is place on the arm the goal\nis to leave it on for 10 minutes without crying due to the stings.\u00a0 When finished the boys arms are temporarily paralyzed\nand they may shake uncontrollably for days.\u00a0\nTo fully complete the initiation, however, the boys must go through this\nordeal a total of 20 times over a several month period or years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHarvester Ants.\u00a0 These (Pogonomyrmex spp.) are commonly thought\nas the large red or black ants that form rather large nests in open fields,\nschoolyards, along railroad tracks, alleys or other similar situations.\u00a0 Of the 23 species that occur in the United States\n22 occur west of the Mississippi River. Beside their large size and color these\nants can be distinguished by fringes of long curved hairs on the back,\nunderside margin of the head.\u00a0 These\nhairs are used to clean the ant\u2019s antennae and legs, carry water and remove\nsand during excavation of their nests. The nests are typically quite large\nconsisting of one or more holes surrounded by a low flat crater (up to 8 inches\nacross).\u00a0 This crater in turn is\nsurrounded by a rather large vegetation free area\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A\nblack harvester ant.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nHarvester ants feed primarily on seed.\u00a0 In agricultural areas they are considered\nbeneficial as they remove weed seeds from crops. The main reason they are found\nalong railroad tracks is due the grain that is lost during transportation.\nHarvester ants readily sting but\ntypically are not aggressive unless defending the nest. \u00a0If disturbed they will swarm from the nest and\nreadily sting. Their venom is extremely powerful resulting in considerable pain\nthat may last for several days.\u00a0\nHarvester ant venom is the most toxic venom found in arthropods although\nthere is considerably less than in black widows and consequently the sting of\nthe ant is much less dangerous than the bite of the spider.\n\u00a0\nFire Ants. There are\nmany species of fire ants in the United States, but the most serious pests are\n4 in the genus Solenopsis: the red imported fire ant, the black imported\nfire ant, the southern fire ant, and the fire ant. Distinguishing between\nimported and native species of fire ants is difficult, even for experts.\nIdentification usually requires 40 or more randomly collected worker ants for\nstudy.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nBlack Imported Fire Ant.\u00a0 The black imported fire ant, Solenopsis\nrichteri, is very similar to the red imported fire ant. Its current\ndistribution is limited to a small area of northern Mississippi and Alabama. It\nmay be displaced from established habitats by the red fire ant.\u00a0 Scientists have long thought that the black\nand red fire ants were 2 distinct species. Recently it has been discovered that\nhybrids of these ants produce viable offspring, and some scientists now wonder\nwhether they are simply 2 races of the same species, varying in color and\nperhaps behavior.\nSouthern Fire Ant. The\nsouthern fire ant, Solenopsis xyloni, is a native species that occurs\nfrom North Carolina south to northern Florida, along the Gulf Coast and west to\nCalifornia. In California it occurs in the lower altitudes from Southern\nCalifornia up through Sacramento but is seldom found along the coast in central\nto northern California.\u00a0 This is probably\nour most common native species of ant but its distribution is greatly retarded\nwhen the Argentine ant is present.\u00a0\nHowever in areas where the Argentine ant is controlled, populations of\nthis species rapidly return.\nColonies may be observed as mounds or\nmore commonly may be constructed under the cover of stones, boards, and other\nobjects or at the base of plants. These ants also nest in wood or the masonry\nof houses, especially around heat sources such as fireplaces. Nests often\nconsist of loose soil with many craters scattered over 2 to 4 square feet. In\ndry areas nests may be along streams, arroyos, and other shaded locations where\nsoil moisture is high. Southern fire ants usually swarm in late spring or\nsummer.\nThe workers are very sensitive to\nvibrations or jarring.\u00a0 If their nest is\nstepped on they will rush out and sting the feet and legs of the intruder.\u00a0 Individual reaction to their venom is quite\nvariable depending on allergic reaction.\u00a0\nThere is a least one case of a human infant death due to mass stinging\nof this species.\nThis species is practically omnivorous\nfeeding on a variety of materials including honeydew, meat, seeds, fruit, nuts,\ncereal and cereal products, grease and butter and dead and living insects. It\ncan be quite detrimental to agriculture foraging for seeds from seed beds,\ngirdling nursery stock, and consuming fruits and vegetables.\u00a0 In addition these ants will remove insulation\nfrom wiring and occasionally gnaws on a variety of fabrics.\nFire Ant.\u00a0 The fire ant, Solenopsis geminata, is\na native species sometimes called the tropical fire ant. It ranges from South\nCarolina to Florida and west to Texas. It is very similar to the southern fire\nant except its head is much larger and the petiole node is higher and\nnarrower.\u00a0\u00a0 This species usually nests in\nmounds constructed around clumps of vegetation, but may also nest under objects\nor in rotting wood. \nRed Imported Fire\nAnt.\u00a0 The red and black imported\nfire ants were first reported in the United States in 1929.\u00a0 It is thought that they came to the port in\nsome soil used as ballast in the bottom of a cargo ship.\u00a0 Since this introduction the black fire ant\nhas not spread as rapidly as the red imported species.\u00a0 By 1953 (first official USDA survey) the red\nimported fire ant had spread to over 100 counties in 10 states.\u00a0 Today it is prevalent throughout the\nsoutheastern US and has moved into Texas, New Mexico. Arizona and California.\nNatural movement of fire\nants is limited to mating flight or by rafting during period of flooding.\u00a0 However, the rapid movement of these species\nacross the South and westward is mainly associated with human activity.\u00a0\u00a0 In this case the initial spread of these\nants in the southeastern US was thought to be due to movement of sod and potted\nornamental plants. \u00a0This\ninadvertent movement of S. invicta and S. richteri was noted by\nthe U.S. Department of Agriculture in 1953 when a direct link was established\nbetween commercial plant nurseries and the spread of imported fire ants. In\nresponse to mounting public pressure, the U.S. Congress appropriated $2.4\nmillion in 1957 for control and eradication efforts. As part of an overall plan\nquarantine was imposed to retard or prevent the artificial dissemination of\nthese now notorious pests. On May 6th 1958, regulations governing the movement\nof nursery stock, grass sod and some other items were instituted through the\nFederal Quarantine 301.81. By that time, however, imported fire ants had moved\ninto 8 southern states. This spread, although slowed considerably by federal\nregulations and climatic conditions, continues even today. In recent years,\nisolated infestations of imported fire ants have been found as far west as New\nMexico, Arizona California and as far north as Kansas and Maryland.\u00a0 In the case of California it is thought that\nthe spread of these ants into this state was due to movement of bee hives as\nmost initial infestations were found in around orchards and other situations\nwhere bees were moved into these areas for crop pollination.\u00a0 Based on USDA prediction these ants have a\npotential of even expanding the spread throughout much of the United States. \n\u00a0.\n\u00a0Current and potential distribution of imported\nred fire ant.\u00a0 Image courtesy of USDA.\nBiology\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Adult\nfire ants (Genus Solenopisis) are\ncharacterized by the presence of a ten-segmented antennae, two-segmented\nantennal club and two-segmented waste that joins the thorax to the abdomen\nwhich is typically darker than the rest of the body.\u00a0 Species identification is somewhat more\ndifficult due to hybridization between the 2 \"native\" species as well\nas between the 2 imported species.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nDiagram\nof diagnostic characteristics of red imported fire ant.\nA mature colony of fire ants typically consists of 4\nmain stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adults.\u00a0\nSince these are true social insect there is a caste system with\ndifferent shaped and sized adults that carry out different function within the\ncolony.\u00a0 These adult forms include the\npolymorphic workers, winged males, winged females and one or more reproductive\nqueens. The egg, larval, and pupal stages (Figure 3) occur within the\nunderground nest and are only seen when nests are disturbed or when they are\nbeing carried to a different location by workers (Figure 4). The eggs are small\nbut can be seen with the unaided eye. They hatch into the grub-like legless larvae\nthat are fed by the workers. Ant larvae in general are legless, carrot shaped\nwith a well-developed unpigmented head capsule and are typically hooked at the\nhead end. The larvae will grow and molt (shed their exoskeleton) 3 times prior\nto molting into the pupae, which are similar in appearance to the adults except\nthat their legs and antennae are held tightly against the body. As with the\nlarvae the pupae lack pigmentation, especially in the early instars.\u00a0 As they mature they begin to turn\ndarker.\u00a0 As discussed in honeybees, the\nfunction of the polymorphic workers is determined primarily by age (and to a\nmuch lesser degree by size). Younger workers typically care for and feed the\nbrood while middle-aged workers maintain and protect the colony. The oldest\nworkers forage for food. \n\nFigure 3.\u00a0 Egg, larval and pupal stage of fire ants.\nImage courtesy of USDA Archives.\n\nFigure 4. \u00a0Worker fire ants carrying larva for\nrelocation.\u00a0 Image courtesy of USDA,\nCalif. Dept Agriculture.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The alates, or winged reproductives\n(Figure 5), are most abundant in the late spring and early summer, but can be\nfound at any time of the year. The males are decidedly smaller than the\nfemales, glossy black and have a smaller head. Although both winged males and\nfemales can be found in the same colony, as a general rule one form will be\ndominant. It is possible that this functions to increase the chances of one sex\nmating with another from a different colony. Most colonies in a given area\ntypically swarm on nuptial flights at the same time. This benefits the species\nand insures mixing of the gene pool.\u00a0 It\nis well-documented that inbreeding is generally detrimental to a given species.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nFigure 5.\u00a0 A winged reproductive of the red imported\nfire ant.\u00a0 Image courtesy of USDA\nArchives.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mating\nflights most often occur at mid-morning 1 or 2 days following a rainfall if the\ntemperature is above 22\u00b0C and the wind is light.\u00a0 At this time a virgin female flies into a\ncloud of congregating males and mates in the air.\u00a0 The male subsequently dies while the female\nseeks a location to start a new colony. Once located, she breaks off her wings\nand excavates a brood chamber approximately 1 to 2 inches below ground.\u00a0 The new queen subsequently deposits a few\ndozen eggs which hatch in a little over a week. The queen does not forage but\nfeeds the first generation of larvae from nutrients obtained from her fat\nreserves and by dissolving her no longer needed wing muscles. The larvae obtain\nthe nutrients by trophollaxisis (exchange of alimentary fluids) or from sterile\neggs she has produced for that purpose.\u00a0\nThe entire life cycle is completed in 3 to 4 weeks.\nThe initial generation of adult worker (minims) are\nrelatively small due to a limited amount of nutrients available from the\nqueen.\u00a0 Once developed these worker open\nup the brood chamber and begin to forage for available food. Soon another\ngeneration of larger adult workers has developed and the colony begins to grow.\nWorkers start to emerge daily and within 6 months the colony population\napproaches several thousand and an above ground mound is visible. The\npolymorphic (poly in Latin means many and morph means form) nature of the\nworker becomes more apparent. The largest workers in the colony (majors) can be\nas much as 10 times the size of the smallest workers (media). The queen lives\nup to 7 years and produces an average of 1600 eggs per day. At maturity, a\nmonogynous (one queen) fire ant colony can consist of over 250,000 ants.\u00a0 As discussed above some fire ant colonies\nhave only one queen per nest while others can have many queens and are called\npolygynous colonies. The polygynous colony may be more difficult to control\nbecause all the queens must be killed to prevent the colony from surviving.\nPolygynous colonies frequently expand by \"budding\"; i.e., some of the\nqueens and workers break off from the parent colony and start a new mound nearby.\u00a0 This process in polygynous colonies can\naccounts for much higher mound density which sometimes approaching 1,000 mounds\nper acre.\n\nDifferent sized worker adults.\u00a0 Image courtesy of USDA Archives.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One of\nthe identifying characteristics of an imported red fire ant colony is the earthen\nnest or mound. This mound is a cone-shaped dome with a hard crust. They\naverages 1 \u00bd feet in diameter and 8-inches in height. In heavy clay soils they\ncan exceed 3-feet in height and 4 1/2 feet diameter. There are usually no\nexternal openings in the mound; but tunnels a few inches below the surface\ntunnels radiate several feet from the mound allowing foraging workers access to\nthe colony. These mounds serves several functions:\u00a0 They act as a flight platform for nuptial\nflights and to raise the colony above ground in excessively wet soil while\nprotecting it above ground from intruders and rain. They also serve as a\npassive solar collector to supply warmth to the colony during the cold winter\nmonths. \n\u00a0\nMound of red imported fire\nant.\u00a0 Image courtesy of USDA Archives.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\nareas with hot, dry summers these mounds may not be maintained or may not be\nformed at all.\u00a0 In a dark, protected site\nwith sufficient moisture and an adequate supply of food, fire ants will nest in\na wide variety of locations (e.g. rotten logs, walls of buildings, under\nsidewalks and roads, in automobiles, in dried cow manure).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Economic Impact\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Fire\nants are omnivorous, feeding on almost any plant or animal material; although\ndead and living insects seem to be their preferred food. In rural habitats,\nthey have a major impact on ground nesting animals (birds, reptiles, mammals).\nStudies have shown that once established in a new area there is typically a\nminimum of a two-fold reduction in the populations of field mice, snakes,\nturtles and other vertebrates and a maximum of a total elimination of some\nspecies.\u00a0 Fire ants also feed on plants\nattacking young saplings and seedlings, destroying buds and developing fruits\nand have been shown to feed on the seeds of over a hundred species of native\nwildflowers and grasses. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nDamage to plants is increased during periods of drought as fire ants\nseek alternate water sources. In fields where drip irrigation is used, these\ninsects build their mounds over the emitters reducing or blocking the flow of\nwater to crops. In some cases, actual physical destruction of microsprinkler\nassemblies has occurred. Finally, the mere presence of fire ants on plants and\nwithin the field will deter hand-harvesting of crops.\n\nAs an urban pest, imported fire ants cause many of the same problems\nexperienced in rural areas.\u00a0 In addition\nthey nest within the walls of homes and offices.\u00a0 Colonies are established under sidewalks and\nroadways frequently resulting in complete collapse of sections of these\nstructures if the nests are eventually abandoned. The presence of fire ants can\ndeter outdoor activities in yards, parks and school grounds. Home invasions can\nthreaten small children and the elderly. House invasions are especially\nprevalent during periods of heavy precipitation and flooding. Fire ant colonies\nhave been found inside automobiles, trucks and recreation vehicles resulting in\ntraffic accidents caused by fire ants stinging the drivers. Imported fire ants\nare attracted by electrical currents and have caused considerable damage to\nheat pumps, air conditioners, telephone junction boxes, transformers, traffic\nlights, and gasoline pumps.\n\nBecause of their reputation people fear fire ants. In some areas playgrounds,\nparks, and picnic areas are rarely used because of the presence of fire ants.\nIn campsites of state and national parks in fire ant infested areas, it is\noften difficult to put up or take down a tent without being stung by angry\nants.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Stings.\u00a0 Fire ants are best known for their\nbehavior of stinging, frequently in mass.\u00a0\nIf a nest is disturbed hundreds if not thousands of ants will quickly\nemerge and attack the intruder. This occurs so quickly and in mass that is not\nuncommon to have hundreds on the victim before the first sting is felt. To make\nmatters even worse a single fire ant can sting repeatedly and will continue to\ndo so even after their venom sac has been depleted. Once reaching the victim\nthe ant will typically attach with its mandibles to the skin and then insert\nits stinger.\u00a0 Subsequently it will rotate\nit abdomen and repeatedly sting using the attached head as a pivot.\u00a0\u00a0 The result is a circle of several stings\nfrom the same ant.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Initially, the sting(s) result in a\nlocalized intense burning sensation (hence the name \"fire\" ant).\nWithin a day or two a white pustule forms at the sting site (Figure 8). Pustule\nformation occurs only with the red and black imported fire ant and not the\nsouthern fire ant or fire ant. There is a possibility of secondary infection\nand scarring if the wounds are not kept clean or if they are continually picked\nat or scratched (Figure 9). As with any other hymenopterous stings, there are a\nfew individuals who are hypersensitive to the venom and can react quite\nstrongly and be severely affected.\u00a0\nSymptoms in these cases can include chest pains, nausea, dizziness,\nshock or, in rare cases, lapsing into coma.\u00a0\nIn cases of an allergic reaction, even a single sting can lead to a\npotentially serious condition called anaphylactic shock. There are recorded\ncases of human death resulting from fire ant stings but these are rare.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nPustular formation for sting of red imported fire ant.\u00a0 Image courtesy of USDA Archives.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nFigure 9. \u00a0Secondary infection of\nsting from red imported fire ant.\u00a0 Image\ncourtesy of USDA Archives.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Individuals with disabilities,\nreduced feeling in their feet and legs or reduced mobility, are at greater risk\nfrom serious stinging incidents and the incidence of resulting medical problems\nmay be even greater. Large numbers of ants can sting and even overcome victims\nbefore they can safely escape. There was a recent case where fire ants entered\na room of an elderly gentleman in a retirement hospital and basically stung him\nto death.\u00a0 In his case he was unable to\nescape their attack.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Individuals who are known to be\nallergic to fire ant stings should seek professional advice from a physician or\nallergist, especially if they are in situations where they might be exposed to\nthese pests. There are emergency treatment kits that are available (by\nprescription) for individuals who are sensitive to their sting. Fortunately,\nrelatively few deaths from fire ant stings have been documented, especially\nwhen compared to deaths from bee and wasp stings. Victims stung to death by\nfire ants often were not able to escape, sustained large numbers of stings, and\nsuffered allergic reactions to the venom. \n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There are basically two methods of fire\nant control, namely individual mound treatment and broadcast treatment.\u00a0 Before attempting either, it is advisable to\ncheck with regulatory agencies as the availability and use of different\nchemicals for either method may vary from state to state.\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, in many cases free control by\nstate governmental agencies of these pests is available.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Individual Mound Treatments. Treating\nindividual fire ant mounds can be time consuming, but it is generally the most\neffective method of control. Once treated it will take anywhere from a few\nhours to a few weeks before total elimination of a colony depending on the\nproduct used, time of the year and size of the mound. Treatment is usually most\neffective in the spring with the key being to treat all the mounds in the\narea.\u00a0 If control is not complete,\nreinfestation of an area can take place in less than a year.\u00a0 There are several different methods that can\nbe used to treat individual mounds.\nInsecticides-One of the\nmore commonly used methods is drenching mounds with a high volume of diluted\ncontact pesticide.\u00a0 As with any treatment, it is extremely\nimportant to follow label directions not only to attain maximum effect, but to\nmaximize safety of the application and avoid potential illegal consequences.\u00a0 In most cases the mounds and surrounding\nareas are wetted thoroughly but gently with the drench. Subsequently the mound\nis broken open and the insecticide is poured directly into the tunnels.\u00a0 Mound drenches are most effective after rains\nwhen the ground is wet and the ants have moved up into the drier soil in the\nmound. During excessively dry weather, effectiveness of the treatment may be\nenhanced by soaking the soil around the mound with water before treatment. One\nproblem with this technique is that the queen may be too deep to be reached\nwith the drench. This may be especially true if the colony is disturbed prior\nto an application.\u00a0 In this case the\nworkers may move the queen deeper into the colony in order to avoid a potential\nthreat.\nGranular formulations are also available\nfor individual mound treatment.\u00a0 In this\ncase once the recommend dose is applied to the mound it should be watered\nthoroughly in order to reach the worker ants and queen that occur deeper in the\ncolony. The dissolved granules must come into direct contact with the ants to\nhave any effect. As in mound drenches, care must be taken not to disturb the\ncolony prior to application. \nA few insecticides are marketed as injectants.\u00a0 In\nthis case they may be injected using a \"termite rig\" with a\nsoil injector tip, a standard 1-3 gallon compressed air sprayer with a fire\nant injector tip, or a special aerosol soil injector system. The mound is injected\nin a circular pattern, usually at 3 to 10 points. A new product combines\ninsecticide treatment with high temperature vapors to increase\npenetration.\u00a0 \n\nFumigants are readily available in most states for fire ant control. These are\nusually more effective than surface applications or mound drenches but are also\nmore expensive and can be dangerous if not handled properly. \nDepending on\nthe state a number of fire ant baits are available. These can be used for\ntreating individual mounds or for broadcast treatment of larger areas. The bait\nshould be uniformly applied around the mound 0.3 to 1.0 meters away and not on\nthe mound itself. Baits are much slower acting than the control methods listed\nabove but are generally safer, cheaper and more effective in the long run.\nWater - The use of\nboiling water has been examined on several different occasions resulting in\nvarying degrees of success. In one experiment over a 50% of treated mound were\neliminated by pouring approximately 3 gallon of hot water directly into the\nmound.\u00a0 The use of steam produced by a\nsteam generator produced similar results.\u00a0\nRegardless both techniques are far less effective the use of drenches,\nfumigants, granular formulation or baits are\u00a0\ncumbersome in the field are not practical when dealing with large\npopulations of these pests. Area wide flooding with water has not proven to be\neffective, impractical in most situations and can led to spreading of the\npopulation due to the rafting ability of these insects.\n\nBroadcast Treatments - A number of fire ant\nbaits (Figure 10) are commercially available for broadcast treatments (again\ndepending on the state). Baits are composed of an inert carrier-attractant\n(corn carrier and soybean oil) and toxicant. The active ingredient (either a\nslow-acting insecticide or an insect growth regulator) is incorporated into the\noil. These baits can be applied either by a hand operated granular fertilizer\nspreader or larger equipment. Once foragers find bait they carry it back to the\nnest, ingest it and begin feeding other ants in the nest.\u00a0 Because the active ingredients are slow\nacting, they are spread around the nest before the desired effect.\u00a0 This formulation and means of application has\na number of advantages. Unlike individual mound treatments, colonies need not\nbe \"located\" in order for them to be treated and as a result this\nmethod is less time intensive and consequently less expensive than individual\nmound treatments.\u00a0 On the other hand\nbroad cast treatment has the potential of affecting non-target organisms. \u00a0It is also slow acting and the effectiveness\nof the bait is greatly reduced when they come in contact with water from rain,\nirrigation or other sources.\u00a0 Finally\nbaits are only effective during those times of the year or temperatures when\nthe ants are readily foraging.\u00a0 Generally\nspeaking it is advisable to only use this type of treatment in areas where\nthere is little or no human traffic.\u00a0 If\nbroadcast treatment is used in such an area, a good choice is growth regulator\nbait, which poses much less risks to non-target species. For example,\nfenoxycarb bait has been shown to be very effective for suppression of fire ant\npopulations when applied in one application over a wide area.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \nFigure\n10.\u00a0 A corn- based bait used for control\nof the red imported fire ant.\u00a0 Image\ncourtesy of USDA Archives.\n\nFigure\n11.\u00a0 A tractor driven granular\napplicator.\u00a0 Image courtesy of USDA\nArchives.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0"], ["Mud Dauber Wasp - PestRx", "https://www.pestrx.com/Mud_Dauber_Wasp.html", "\n\nCall Today! 888 788-8178 (toll free)\n Inspections\u00a0Available - Servicing Throughout Connecticut\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\nInsect stings can\u00a0create\u00a0a life-threatening, allergic reaction in some individuals.

Their heads are wide, and their waists are thread-thin.\nBiology and life cycle: Adult female wasps paralyze insects and other wasp prey by stinging. They then lay an egg on them and store them in a cell of the mud nest. The larvae feed on the living tissue of the stored insects.\nHabitat: Most flowering plants and food crops.\nFeeding habits: Female adults hunt and paralyze spiders, crickets, cicadas, flies, and leafhoppers. Before sealing each egg cell, she drops a spider in to feed the larva later. Adults like flowers and feed on nectar and pollen.\nEconomic importance: Control of spiders, especially black widows.\nNatural control: Birds and spiders.\nOrganic control: None needed.Insight: Extremely beneficial insects. Their favorite food is the black widow spider. When the mud dauber catches spiders, she doesn't kill them. The sting paralyzes the leg muscles so the spider can't move. She then carries them to a mud chamber, lays an egg with the spider, and seals the chamber. Her egg hatches into a wasp larva; the larva crawls among the spiders, eating their leg muscles first. The larva doesn't feed on the spider bodies until last, so the spider remains alive longer.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The cicada killer (another beneficial wasp) is a close relative of the mud dauber.

The long cylinders of mud, 6 inches or so in \r\nlength, are usually constructed in protected areas such as inside barns or under \r\nhouse eaves. Because several slender cylinders are constructed side by side, the \r\ncompleted nest looks like a bank of organ pipes. Although only used by the wasps \r\nfor one summer, the nests may persist for years.\nAs the wasp builds the nest, it \r\ncarries small balls of clayey mud in its legs to the nest, then molds each \r\ndollop of mud with its mouth and legs to the right shape. Often, it also \r\nvibrates its wings and buzzes, perhaps to dry the clay into pottery or even to \r\nhelp shape it. It has been suggested that the vibration of the wasp\u2019s wings is \r\nattuned to the resonant frequency of the mud, so that the mud picks up the \r\nvibration the same way a guitar string will hum with the sympathetic vibration \r\nfrom a correctly pitched voice. So much of nature is harmonic! \nIf you\u2019ve ever removed an active \r\ndirt-dauber nest and looked inside, you may have noticed that the cylinders are \r\nmade of several chambers, each of which is packed with spiders. Most people \r\nsqueal, drop the nest and take off at this point, but the story gets even more \r\nmacabre.\nThe spiders are alive, but are \r\nparalyzed. Some of them will weakly move their legs, but none can crawl. And now \r\nfor the worst of it\u2014entombed inside each section of the nest with several \r\nliving, helpless spiders, is one wasp egg. When it hatches, the wasp larva will \r\nbegin to eat the spiders, one by one. The spiders are kept alive so that they \r\nare fresh, ready for the larva to eat when the time comes. Similarly, sailors \r\nused to fill their ships with Galapagos tortoises, turned upside down to keep \r\nthem helpless, so that the crew would have fresh meat during their multi-year \r\njourneys.\nIf you are really observant, you \r\nmight even see the wasps hunting for their prey. Different species of wasp \r\nprefer different species of prey. Some hunting wasps select only spiders that \r\nlive on the forest floor, others prefer spiders that build webs in the open, and \r\none western species specializes on tarantulas! Other hunting wasps eat \r\ncaterpillars, crickets, cicadas, or aphids instead of spiders. Most of the \r\nhunting wasps look very similar\u2014they are blue-black and slim-waisted, and \r\nflutter their wings as they hunt. In addition to mud daubers, potter wasps also \r\nuse mud to build their nests, but construct tiny pots instead of pipes. Others, \r\nsuch as the more colorful cicada killers, dig nests in the ground, and still \r\nothers, such as the aphid wasps, bore into wood.\nThe battle between a wasp and a \r\nspider can be dramatic because they are of similar size. The wasp leaps on the \r\nspider, and often they tumble around together, rattling the dried leaves, as \r\neach tries to gain the advantage. Usually the wasp succeeds in stinging the \r\nspider, which then goes limp. Often the spider is so large that the wasp must \r\ndrag it across the ground or fly in short hops to its nest.\nAnother group of strange-looking \r\nwasps that are common this time of year have a similar natural history. These \r\nwasps, called ichneumonids and pelecinids, have very long, skinny abdomens. \r\nTheir prey is the larvae of beetles, and the long abdomen is used to penetrate \r\neither wood or soil, depending on where the beetle grub lives, and place the \r\nwasp egg onto the body of the beetle larva. When it hatches, the wasp larva eats \r\nthe beetle grub.\nSo next time you see a wasp, \r\nwatch it for a while and you might see something of its hunting behavior. \r\nHunting wasps rarely sting, so there is no need to destroy the nests of \r\ndirt-daubers. You can stand right by the nest and watch as the mother wasp \r\nbrings in spiders to fortify her children.\n\n\nNest of \r\nDirt-daubers\n\u00a0\nCopyright 2003 by \r\nJennifer E.

Usually you\u2019ll find this wasp building a nest on the side of a house or other structure. They prefer to use clay to build their homes, but will use other materials if clay is unavailable. Their ideal home-building spot if the attic, as it is a warm spot in the summer and it is generally a quiet, undisturbed spot.\nThe mud dauber wasp is a solitary insect. This species is not prone to building a colony, and it\u2019s also not common to see these in a swarm. Even if you find several nests along the side of your house, this is likely the work of a single female wasp.\nThese wasps are thin and about an inch long. There are various types of mud dauber wasps. The type with yellow stripes along its body builds a simple nest, usually in a crack or cranny. Each one of these nests usually has one single egg in it. The blue type tends to take over nests from other insects. The organ pipe dauber can be found in tube-like nests along walls and overhangs. Unless disturbed, all three of these tend to occupy the same area for years, building additional nests and expanding their construction. Expanded nests consist of tubes set up side by side.\nMud dauber wasps are predators and hunt for food. It is usually the male wasps that guard the larvae, while the females go out hunting.. They have a stinger in their abdomen and, contrary to bees, can sting many times without dying. They often go after smaller spiders, and are in turn hunted by larger spiders such as the black widow and the brown widow.\nIn a scene straight out of \u201cAlien,\u201d the wasp does not kill its victim, but carries it back to the nest and places its egg inside it. The prey provides food for the wasp larvae.\nWhile people are often anxious about wasps, mud daubers do not pose a serious threat. They are not a particularly aggressive species. They are unlikely to sting unless directly threatened. Since they hunt little spiders, they\u2019re helpful in removing many spiders that people do not like to find in their homes. Unlike yellow jackets, these wasps do not live in large colonies so there is little danger of a serious infestation.\nOne scenario where it becomes necessary to get rid of these insects is during house painting. The tube-like nests can be removed with a putty knife, but it if best to leave this to an Orange County mud wasp nest removal professional.\nThe Bee Detectives is your reliable choice for Orange County mud wasp nest removal.

The\r\n        aphecinae mud daubers overwinter as full-grown larvae, pupate in the spring, and emerge\r\n        shortly thereafter. Females construct nests of mud. Many short mud tubes/cells, usually\r\n        about 1\" (25 mm) long, are constructed side-by-side. Each cell is provisioned with\r\n        several spiders which she has paralyzed with her venom, with the first spider in having an\r\n        egg deposited on it. Eventually this mass of tubes is about 3-4\" (7.6- 10 cm) in\r\n        diameter and is entirely plastered over with mud. The female then selects another site and\r\n        starts over. A larva can complete its development in about 3 weeks, then spins a silken\r\n        cocoon but does not pupate until the following spring. Females typically provision their\r\n        cells with only one kind or group of spiders.\nMud daubers do not defend their nests, and only rarely sting.\nHABITS. \r\n        Mud daubers typically select a sheltered site to build their mud tubes. Favorite sites\r\n        include under eaves, porch ceilings, in garages and sheds left open, in barns, protected\r\n        building walls, in attics, etc.Nests typically exhibit round holes in them as the wasps\r\n        emerge. This means the nest is probably old and inactive after springtime."]]], "bull ant": ["https://www.google.com/search?num=20&q=bull+ant", [["Myrmecia - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myrmecia", "Halmamyrmecia Wheeler, 1922\nPristomyrmecia Emery, 1911\nPromyrmecia Emery, 1911\nMyrmecia, often called bulldog ants, bull ants, inch ants, sergeant ants, jumper ants or jack-jumpers (although jack jumper only applies to members of the M. pilosula species group), is a genus of ants. Bull ants can grow to over 40\u00a0mm (1.6\u00a0in) in length, with the smallest species 15\u00a0mm (0.59\u00a0in) long. Almost all of the approximately 90 species are endemic to Australia, with the single exception of Myrmecia apicalis from New Caledonia, where it is rare.[3]\n\n\nThese ants are well known in Australia for their aggressive behaviour and powerful stings.[3] The venom of these ants has the potential to induce anaphylactic shock in allergic sting victims. As with most severe allergic reactions, the reaction may be lethal if left untreated. These large, alert ants have characteristic large eyes and long, slender mandibles. They have superior vision, able to track and even follow intruders from a distance of 1 m.[3] Myrmecia is one of several ant genera which possess gamergates, female worker ants which are able to mate and reproduce, thus sustaining the colony after the loss of the queen. A colony of Myrmecia pyriformis without queen was collected in 1998 and kept in captivity, during which time the gamergates produced viable workers for three years.[4]\nBull ants eat small insects, honeydew (a sweet, sticky liquid found on leaves, deposited from various insects), seeds, fruit, fungi, gums, and nectar. Because they mostly live exclusively in bushland, they are rarely exposed to a human-influenced diet. The adult ants mainly eat nectar and honeydew, but the ant larvae are carnivores that eat small insects brought back to them by hunting worker ants. The workers can also regurgitate food back in the nest so other ants can consume it.[citation needed]\nFoes of bull ants are the black ants[clarification needed], which despite being much smaller, use their much greater numbers to overwhelm bull ant colonies.[citation needed]\nThe bull ant famously appears in the philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer's major work, The World as Will and Representation, as a paradigmatic example of strife and constant destruction endemic to the \"will to live\".\n\"But the bulldog-ant of Australia affords us the most extraordinary example of this kind; for if it is cut in two, a battle begins between the head and the tail. The head seizes the tail in its teeth, and the tail defends itself bravely by stinging the head: the battle may last for half an hour, until they die or are dragged away by other ants. This contest takes place every time the experiment is tried.\"[5]"], ["Bull ant - The RuneScape Wiki", "http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Bull_ant", "The Bull ant is a level 40 Summoning familiar, and can carry up to 9 items and lasts for 30 minutes.

They have superior vision, able to track and even follow intruders from a distance of 1 metre. Many species of bull ants have bright red or orange colours on the head or abdomen.\nThere are about 90 species of bull ants in Australia with diverse behaviours and life cycles. Nine bull ant species have been recorded in Sydney, but there may be more as yet undiscovered. Some of the smaller species are known as jumper ants after their habit of aggressively jumping toward intruders.\n\r\n\u00a0\n8 mm - 40 mm\nBull ants are found throughout Australia.\nBull ants live in urban areas, forests and woodland, and heath.\nBull ants collect nectar and other plant juices, as well as animal prey, which are carried back to the nest.\nBull ant nests are usually underground and often have hidden or small entrances. The nests can extend several metres below the ground. They attack intruders of any size that come too close to their nest. Bull ants also have well-developed vision and will follow or even chase an intruder a good distance from the nest. Usually the sight of large aggressive ants streaming out of the nest is enough to prompt a hasty retreat. If not, the ants deliver painful stings by gripping the intruder with their mandibles (jaws), curling their abdomen to reveal the sting and injecting the victim with venom. Often multiple stings are delivered.\nSeveral species have no colony workers. Instead, a raiding queen invades the nest of another species, kills the resident queen and takes over the colony.\nThese ants can deliver painful stings and are aggressive. An ice pack or commercially available spray may be used to relieve the pain of the sting. If there is evidence of an allergic reaction, medical attention should be sought.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\n\n\r\nLast Updated: 30 January 2014\n\n    \r\n        Tags\r\n        \r\n    \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            ants, \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            insects, \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            arthropods, \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            invertebrates, \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            identification, \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            wildlife of sydney, \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            dangerous, \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            bites, \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            stings, \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            myrmecia, \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            stinging, \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            anaphylactic shock, \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            allergic reaction, \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            bull ants, \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            bulldog ants, \r\n        \r\n    \n\r\n            Head of a Bull Ant Myrmecia sp View full size\n\r\n            Michael Elliot\u00a0\u00a9\u00a0Australian Museum\r\n            \r\n        \n\r\n            Bull Ant walking across leaf View full size\n\r\n            Andrew Donnelly\u00a0\u00a9\u00a0Australian Museum\r\n            \r\n        \nWiFi is available throughout the Museum\nAll our phone, email and other contact details.\nBecome a Member for free admission, Explore magazine subscription and more.\nSubscribe to our newsletters for the latest events, offers and information."], ["EENY272/IN455: Florida Carpenter Ant, Bull Ant, Tortugas ...", "http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/in455", "John Warner and Rudolf H. Scheffrahn2\nThe Florida carpenter ant complex is comprised of several species, two of which are common around structures: Camponotus floridanus (Buckley) and Camponotus tortuganus (Emery). These bicolored arboreal ants are among the largest ants found in Florida, making them apparent as they forage or fly indoors and out. \n\n\nFigure 1.\u00a0\nMajor workers of Camponatus sp.Credit: Rudolf H. Scheffrahn, University of Florida [Click thumbnail to enlarge.]\n\n\nMajor workers of Camponatus sp.\nIn a survey of common urban pest ant species covering four metropolitan areas of Florida (Daytona- Orlando, Tampa Bay area, Sarasota-Ft. Myers, and the greater Miami area), Klotz et al. 1995 found that infestations of Florida carpenter ants accounted for approximately 20% of all ant complaints by homeowners. Klotz et al. (1995) found only a few instances where other ants, including imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta Buren), crazy ant (Paratrechina longicornis (Latreille), ghost ant (Tapinoma melanocephalum (Fabr.), and pharaoh ant (Monomorium pharaonis (L.)) were more frequently encountered in buildings than carpenter ants. \nDuring the flight season, carpenter ants can often be found in alarming numbers. Sometimes homeowners are concerned about damage to the structural integrity of their homes, which they sometimes incorrectly learn, is caused by Florida carpenter ants. However, unlike the wood-damaging black carpenter ant, Camponotus pennsylvanicus (DeGreer), found in Florida's panhandle and a few other western U.S. species, Florida carpenter ants seek either existing voids in which to nest or excavate only soft materials such as rotten or pithy wood and Styrofoam. Other concerns are that these ants sting (they do not) and bite (they do). \nIn recent years, a small and exotic daytime-foraging carpenter ant, C. planatus Roger, has become common in many parts of central and southern Florida. \n\n\nFigure 2.\u00a0\nDistribution map.Credit: Rudolf H. Scheffrahn, University of Florida [Click thumbnail to enlarge.]\n\n\nDistribution map.\nCamponotus floridanus is found widely distributed throughout Florida and some neighboring states, while C. tortuganus is limited to central and southern portions of Florida. The ratio of C. floridanus to C. tortuganus is about 2:1 in south Florida. There are several other Camponotus species found in Florida, however, these are rare or usually not associated with buildings. These species include Camponotus caryae (Fitch), C. castaneus (Latreille), C. decipiens Emery, C. discolor (Buckley), C. impressus (Roger), C. nearcticus Emery, C. pylartes Wheeler, C. sexguttatus (Fabr.), C. snellingi Bolton, and C. socius Roger. \nThe antennae of Florida carpenter ants are 12-segmented, with the terminal segment being slightly elongated and bullet-shaped, and without a club. There is a circular ring of hair at the end of the abdomen. The waist consists of one petiolar segment. The antennal scape is flattened basally and broad throughout. Workers vary in size, ranging from 5.5 to 11 mm in length. Smaller workers are called minors while larger workers are called majors. Winged females (alates) are the largest caste reaching up to 20 mm in length. There is no sting, but workers can bite and spray formic acid for defense. The thorax is evenly convex; a key characteristic of carpenter ants. The thorax and head are ash brown to rusty-orange and the gaster is black. Body hairs are abundant, long, and golden. Male reproductives are much smaller than queens with proportionally smaller heads and larger wings. Specific characters for C. floridanus include legs and antennal scapes with numerous long, coarse brown to golden erect hairs, shorter than those on the body. For C. tortuganus, specific characters include a major worker with head longer than broad; tibia of all legs and antennal scapes without erect hairs; and thinner than C. floridanus and paler with less color contrast. \n\n\nFigure 3.\u00a0\nFemale alate (reproductive) of the Florida carpenter ant, Camponatus floridanus (Buckley).Credit: Rudolf H.

Notice that worker's head is longer than broad. \nAs with all members of the Order Hymenoptera, carpenter ants develop by complete metamorphosis, going through stages of the egg, larva, pupa, and adult worker or reproductive. Larvae are maggot- like, and pupae reside in silk cocoons and are often mistaken for eggs. Winged reproductives fly in the evening or night during the rainy season (May through November). Typically, a single queen, fertilized by a smaller short-lived male, will start a new colony, caring for her first brood of larvae until they develop into workers, which then begin to forage for food. Workers then care for the queen and ensuing brood. The colony will continue to grow and populations may reach several thousand workers. When the colony is two to five years old, depending on environmental conditions, new winged reproductives, or alates, will usually be sent out. Alates (winged reproductives) are observed from spring to fall, depending on the area and environmental conditions. Queenless satellite nests are often founded within 20 to 100 feet of a mature nest. Proximity of nests can lead to fighting among neighboring colonies. \n\n\nFigure 6.\u00a0\nFlorida carpenter ant, Camponotus floridanus (Buckley), dealate queen tending brood.

Alarmed homeowners often see these ants foraging (especially at night) and either attempt to control the ants with spray insecticides or call their local pest control operator (PCO). PCOs report going to innumerable homes to speak with frantic homeowners who have failed to control foraging or flying carpenter ants. Many PCOs and seasoned entomologists have resigned to failure after not being able to treat hidden nesting sites, sometimes after years of trying! An experienced pest control operator, or a determined homeowner, can usually follow a trail of ants back to the ants' nesting site and treat it (see Management below). \nComplaints are numerous during the spring swarm season, usually between April and June, when winged reproductives are often found in homes in such places as along window ledges and near sliding glass doors. It is common to mistake winged ants for winged termites. Differences between ants and termites are given below: \n\n\nFigure 9.\u00a0\nAnt Alate: Elbowed antennae,  Fore wings larger  than hind wings,  Waist constricted.Credit: Rudolf H.

Scheffrahn, University of Florida [Click thumbnail to enlarge.]\n\n\nTermite Alate: Beaded antennae, Fore and hind  wings of equal size, Waist broad.\nFlorida carpenter ants tend to forage at night. The peak foraging hours are just before sunset until two hours after sunset, then again around dawn. Foraging proceeds in very loosely defined trails or by individual ants that seem to wander aimlessly. These ants have a fondness for sweets and can be found in campgrounds near soda machines and other areas where sweets are readily accessible. Similarly, they are fond of sweet floral nectars and honeydews produced by sucking insects, especially aphids, scales, and mealybugs. Trees and shrubs which are infested with these honeydew-producing insects or produce nectars will have ants wandering in all directions over leaf surfaces, up and down the stems and trunk. Carpenter ants will also seek out other insects, both living and dead, for food. \nCarpenter ants foraging in homes can be in search of sweets or moisture, or even new nesting sites, especially in kitchens and bathrooms, or other rooms that have water leaks from plumbing or leaks around doors and windows. Otherwise, they might simply be trailing from an interior nest to an exterior food source. \nCarpenter ants, like many other ants, will trail along wires or cables that may be attached to homes and serve frequently as access routes for them to enter attics and other above ground areas. Tall trees touching structures cause \"bridges\" which provide foraging access into buildings. \nCarpenter ants seem to prefer voids for nesting which have these characteristics: \nClose to moisture and food sources \nSafe from predators such as birds and lizards \nSafe from flooding, heat, and other environmental stresses \nEasily accessible (for them, but inaccessible for the PCO!) \nThey will hollow out wood softened by moisture and/or fungi to create nests. This wood can be in tree stumps or dead tree limbs, or in any part of a structure having damaged wood. They will not excavate nesting galleries in sound wood. Bits of debris, called frass, are often ejected from nesting sites. Frass consists of bits of excavated materials and pieces of dead insects, including carpenter ants. \nCommon exterior nesting sites include: old drywood termite galleries and wooden objects that have had previous damage from other organisms including insects or fungi; rotting tree stumps and tree holes or crotches between limbs; under old leaf petioles in palms, especially in and around the inflorescence of coconut palms; under bark, in roots of trees, especially citrus trees; in old wooden fences, sheds, old wooden decks, bamboo poles (even thin or short pieces) or tree supports, debris of almost any kind, coconuts left on the ground, under mulch, inside logs or wooden borders in gardens, railroad ties, old shoes, in voids in ceramic or concrete decorations, walls or support pillars, in expansion joints either not filled in or filled with rubbery materials, under stones, in home exterior coverings, especially wood panels, and so on. \nCommon interior nesting sites include: wall voids (especially walls that have moisture seepage), under attic insulation and usually near the eaves where they are very difficult to reach, under bath tubs, very common under windows and door frames which have moisture intrusion from rain or sprinklers, around skylights, in boxes or paper bags, in closets which are not often used, under appliances, especially dish washers, in flat roofs (one of the most difficult problems due to lack of adequate access), behind wood panels, in wood furniture, cracks in floors, under bathroom fixtures, and many other places! Carpenter ants are sometimes found in electrical boxes, such as fuse, meter, or timer boxes or appliances. Unusual nest sites have included a computer printer, a radio, and a pay phone. Also check hollow supports of patio screens or voids in patio ceilings.\nDirect treatment of nesting sites is recommended because these sites harbor the brood, queen, and a bulk of the workers and winged reproductives, however, finding the nest sites can be difficult. A small amount of insecticidal dust or spray applied directly to the nest area is usually successful. Excessive treatment can become repellent, actually causing the nest to move to another location if the dust or spray is applied near-to but not directly on the nest. \nObservation of foragers entering voids is the best means of finding the nest. Watch for trailing ants at their peak nocturnal foraging hours and follow them. Look for areas of higher ant population density indicating closer proximity to the nest. Placing a few drops of sugar water, honey or dead insects along a trail can cause other nestmates to be recruited to the area. Try to follow the foragers back to the nest and then treat the nest. \n\n\nFigure 11.\u00a0\nWorker of the Florida carpenter ant, Camponatus floridanus (Buckley), entering a void.Credit: Rudolf H. Scheffrahn, University of Florida [Click thumbnail to enlarge.]\n\n\nWorker of the Florida carpenter ant, Camponatus floridanus (Buckley), entering a void.\nThere are many situations in which the nest is not accessible, or cannott be found. In those cases use one of the baits made for carpenter ants, and follow the label directions. Usually baits are simply placed along the trail and foragers bring the toxic baits back to the nest where food and toxicant are shared via trophallaxis (communal food sharing). Carpenter ants are finicky eaters and tend not to recruit in large numbers to any food source thus decreasing the efficacy of insecticidal baits. Residual sprays in foraging areas can also be helpful. Be sure to spray areas where ants are feeding, such as trees and shrubs. A systemic insecticide can help control aphids and other honeydew producers to reduce food for the carpenter ants. \nEliminate \"bridges\" caused by trees and shrubs touching house exteriors. If wires or power cables are being used as bridges, it may be possible to have a professional treat the wires or areas where the wires attach to the structure. There are a number of \"pest barrier\" substances available that are sticky and can be used on tree trunks and other places to stop ants from passing. Caulking exterior openings and weather striping may also aid in control. Read and follow label instructions and precautions before using any insecticide. \nDeyrup MA. 1991.

As far as ants go, bull ants are the giants. \nThey are the largest ants in Australia, with only a few species which rival them in other parts of the world. They are instantly recognisable by their huge mandibles on the front of their heads, and a long, slender body. There are almost 100 different species of bull ants, all but one are endemic to Australia. New Caledonia has a single rare species. \nBull ant colonies are relatively small, with numbers of individuals in the low hundreds rather than thousands like many other ant species. They have a fertile queen whose sole role is to lay eggs, and infertile female workers who carry out all the work required to keep the colony alive. Seasonally, fertile male and female (new queen) bull ants are produced. These have wings and leave the nest to start new colonies. \nOf course, bull ants are a very well known ant. Campers and bushwalkers are acquainted only too well with the insects by way of the painful stings bull ants can inflict while defending their nests. They can be extremely aggressive when defending their nests, and have excellent eyesight enabling them to locate intruders. Many people who are stung believe the large mandibles inflict the pain; however, it is a sting located in the abdomen that causes this severe discomfort. Bull ants can sting multiple times \u2013 just like wasps \u2013 and use this for capturing insect prey as well as for defence.\nThey are active by day and night, and the workers forage over long distances on their own rather than in trails like many other ants. Workers collect insects which they overpower and sting, taking them back to the nest to feed the young. Despite their large jaws, the adult bull ants feed mainly upon sugars such as nectar from flowering plants. \nBull ant \u2018babies\u2019 are called larvae. They are helpless, small white grubs which are kept deep in the nest and are tended to by the workers as they develop and grow. Dead and paralysed insects are brought to them to feed upon until they are ready to pupate. Pupation is the same process a caterpillar goes through to \u2018metamorphose\u2019 into a butterfly. Bull ants do this within a brown paper-like case or cocoon. When the adult bull ants emerge they are fully formed, but just a little lighter in colour than their older counterparts.\n\u00a0\n\n\nHome I About us l Kids Parties l Animal Wrangling l Photography l Education l Pets l Resources l Contact us l "], ["Insect Vista - Bull Ants - Insects", "http://www.insectvista.com/Bull_Ants.html", "\n\n \n\n\nGlobeVista\nContact\u00a0Us\nReferences\nDisclaimer\n\n\n\n\n\nOrder\nHymenoptera\nFamily\nFormicidae\nAlternative names\r\n: Bulldog Ant\nThe bulldog ant or as commonly known the \"bull ant\" is a\r\nlarge, aggressive ant which has long, straight, powerful jaw\r\nand a venom-loaded sting. The bull ant is one of the most\r\naggressive ants in Australia. There are over 90 species of bull\r\nants in Australia and they belong to the Order Hymenoptera and\r\nthe Family Formicidae and are classified differently according\r\nto their antenna length. Many species of bull ants have bright\r\nred or orange colours on their head or abdomen and are among\r\nthe largest of any ant species measuring up to 1.5 inches (3.8\r\ncm) in length. The bull ants feed on plant nectar and insect\r\nprey. They build their nests underground with only a small\r\nentrance.\nThe name of bulldog ant was given to them\r\n     because of their strong grip and savage bite. They will\r\n     guard their nests feircely and have no issues in attacking\r\n     an intruder of any size that comes too close, especially\r\n     children. Some bull ants known as \"jumper ants\" will jump\r\n     at an intruder. With well developed vision the bull ant\r\n     will follow or chase an intruder from its nest. They use\r\n     their strong claw-like mandibles to grab food, crush prey\r\n     and to ward off predators. The ant can deliver a very\r\n     painful sting by using its mandibles (jaws) to grip the\r\n     intruder and then curl its abdomen to sting and inject its\r\n     victim with venom. It is not uncommon for the victim to\r\n     receive multiple stings. There has been six sting related\r\n     deaths in Australia from a bull ant bite according to the\r\n     Australian Bureau of Statistics, five in Tasmania and one\r\n     in New South Wales. The deaths were all males aged between\r\n     40-80 years of age and were due to allergic reactions to\r\n     the venom. Now, if you are planning to go and poke a Bull\r\n     Ant's nest with a stick, hear is\u00a0a\u00a0little word\r\n     of warning, DON\"T, these guys are smart.

However, the bull ant species are a\r\nlittle less organised and many of the Bull Ant species do not\r\nwork together but prefer to work independently of each other.\r\nThe queen even has to find her own food. They do however tend\r\nto the larvae making sure they are well fed.\nClosely related species of the bull ant have been found in\r\nfossils dating back to the Triassic Period (245 million years\r\nago) in Australia and Asia.\nInsects Ants Bull\u00a0Ants Meat\u00a0Ants Ant\u00a0Trivia Bees Honeybee Killer\u00a0Bee Bee\u00a0Trivia Myths,\u00a0Legends\u00a0and\u00a0Folklore Butterflies Cabbage\u00a0White Wanderer Australian\u00a0Painted\u00a0Lady Butterfly\u00a0Trivia Cicadas Cicada\u00a0Trivia Myths,\u00a0Legends\u00a0and\u00a0Folklores Damselflies Damselfly\u00a0Trivia Dragonflies Myths,\u00a0Legends\u00a0and\u00a0Folklore Flies March\u00a0Flies Flesh\u00a0Fly Fly\u00a0Trivia Ladybirds Ladybird\u00a0Trivia Myths,\u00a0Legends\u00a0and\u00a0Folklores Wasps Wasp\u00a0Trivia Weevils Elephant\u00a0Weevils References Disclaimer \n\n\n\u00a9 GlobeVista 2007 - All Rights Reserved\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \n\n \n\n\nInsects\n\n\nAnts\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\u25e6\u00a0 Bull Ants\n\r\n\u25e6\u00a0 Meat Ants\n\r\n\u25e6\u00a0 Ant Trivia\n\n\n\nBees\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\u25e6\u00a0 Honeybee\n\r\n\u25e6\u00a0 Killer Bee\n\r\n\u25e6\u00a0 Bee Trivia\n\r\n\u25e6\u00a0 Myths, Legends and Folklore\n\r\n\u25e6\u00a0 Colony Collapse Disorder\n\n\n\nBeetles\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\u25e6\u00a0 Beetle Trivia\n\n\n\nBugs\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\u25e6\u00a0 Shield Bugs\n\r\n\u25e6\u00a0 Crusader Bugs\n\n\n\nButterflies\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\u25e6\u00a0 Cabbage White\n\r\n\u25e6\u00a0 Wanderer\n\r\n\u25e6\u00a0 Australian Painted Lady\n\r\n\u25e6\u00a0 Butterfly Trivia\n\n\n\nCicadas\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\u25e6\u00a0 Cicada Trivia\n\r\n\u25e6\u00a0 Myths, Legends and Folklores\n\n\n\nDamselflies\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\u25e6\u00a0 Damselfly Trivia\n\n\n\nDragonflies\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\u25e6\u00a0 Myths, Legends and Folklore\n\r\n\u25e6\u00a0 Dragonfly Trivia\n\n\n\nFlies\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\u25e6\u00a0 March Flies\n\r\n\u25e6\u00a0 Flesh Fly\n\r\n\u25e6\u00a0 Fly Trivia\n\n\n\nKatydids\n\n\nLadybirds\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\u25e6\u00a0 Ladybird Trivia\n\r\n\u25e6\u00a0 Myths, Legends and Folklores\n\n\n\nWasps\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\u25e6\u00a0 Wasp Trivia\n\n\n\nWeevils\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\u25e6\u00a0 Elephant Weevils\n\n\n\nInsect Vista\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0"], ["Bull Ants - Teaching Treasures", "http://teachingtreasures.com.au/student-projects/bull-ants.htm", "\n\nNOTE: To return to\r\n\tthis page from the links click the back button on your browser.\n\nBull ants\r\n\tare fierce little creatures. The sting of a bull ant is not barbed and does not\r\n\tremain in the victim, unlike the sting of a bee. The bull ant can sting again\r\n\tand again repeating its dose of nasties. The bull ant's stinger is located in\r\n\tthe abdomen. The jaws of the bull ant workers are quite gentle unlike many other\r\n\tants. They feed on other insects and things such as honeydew from scale insects.\r\n\tThe queen bull ant leaves the nest at night to forage and supplement the food\r\n\tsupply of her progeny. (the baby bull ants) These ants have a red head and\r\n\tthorax but the abdomen are black. They make their nests underground and have\r\n\tquite extensive tunnel systems. You can usually identify a \r\n\tbull\r\n\tant's nest by the mound of dirt with rather large opening, sometimes several\r\n\topenings at the top. The dirt is loosely scattered around the mound and two or\r\n\tthree bull ant guards (soldiers) can often be seen in the immediate area keeping\r\n\ta sharp eye out for any possible intruders.\n\n\n\nBull ants are also called soldier ants or bulldog\r\n\tants. They grow to an average of one inch long. Scientific name: Myrmecia gulosa\nThere are a few natural remedies should you get stung by one of these ants. If you have a \r\n\tpigface\r\n\tgroundcover growing nearby simply take a couple of leaves\r\n\tand squeeze the juice from the leaves on the stung area. Rub in gently and you will notice an almost immediate pain \r\n\trelief. Juvenile bracken fern when broken off at ground level will produce some  sap which you can also rub on to \r\n\tthe effected area. These natural remedies are  only good if you apply them almost immediately, \r\n\t(within the minute or two) otherwise you may be able to obtain a cream from the chemist to relief the pain \r\n\tand swelling.\nThe behaviour of ants has fascinated scientists\r\n\tfor a long time and no wonder when you consider they can carry food up to seven\r\n\ttimes their own body weight. Their social behaviour is among the most complex in\r\n\tthe insect world. They communicate by touch and smell and constantly touch each\r\n\tother to pass on their nest odour. All ants have two sets of jaws, the outer\r\n\tpair is used for carrying objects and for digging while the inner pair is used\r\n\tfor chewing. All ants play an important role in the environment. They will\r\n\tdispose of rotting plants and dead animals ranging from a little mouse to a big elephant.\nThere are about 8000 species of ants in the insect\r\n\tfamily Formicidae (order Hymenoptera). Ants live just about all over the world\r\n\tbut they generally prefer warmer climates. They range from as little as 2mm to\r\n\t25mm in size. Ants live eight to ten weeks passing through a four-stage life\r\n\tcycle, - egg - larva - pupa and adult. The workers are the females and do the\r\n\tlabour of the nest while the larger ones are the soldiers, defending the colony.\r\n\tAt certain times of the year many ant species produce winged males and queens.\r\n\tThese fly into the air where they mate (with the male dying soon afterwards).\r\n\tThe fertilized queen ant then establishes a new nest and spends the rest of her\r\n\tlife laying eggs for her colony. \nSome ants develop a terrific relationship with\r\n\tother insects or even fungi. The Cornfield Ant works well with the Strawberry\r\n\tAphids. The aphids produce a sticky substance known as honeydew which attracts\r\n\tthe ants because it is one of their favourite food source. The ants protect the\r\n\taphids from predators like the ladybird, and in return the aphids feed the ants.\r\n\tIn fruit orchards where aphids have become a pest and cause damage to fruit\r\n\ttrees it is essential to eradicate certain ants nests. By getting rid of the\r\n\tants, the aphid problem will soon be resolved and ladybirds will once again be\r\n\table to cope with just a few aphids rather than millions of them which are\r\n\tprotected by their enemy, the ant.\n\nTEST YOUR KNOWLEDGE\n\nback"], ["BullAnt | Grasshopper - Food4Rhino", "http://www.food4rhino.com/project/bullant", "BullAnt is a Rhino3d/Grasshopper plug-in primarily for Architects and Engineers (but also other Rhino/Grasshopper users)\u00a0featuring computational design tools to enhance and extend the parent program and other 3rd party plug-ins.

To get to it, we needed to go down this path\u2026\nThe reward for travelling down the path would be stunning views\u2026\n\n\u00a0\nBut our journey along this path was not without its dangers. About halfway down, there it was. I don\u2019t know if we actually saw it first or felt the vibrations as this monster walked across our paths.\nWe were lucky this fellow was on his own, they normally hang around in gangs which they scarily prefer to refer to as \u2018armies\u2019.\nI managed to take a photo of this big boy before he disappeared under some leaves. Once he\u2019d disappeared from sight though, I wasn\u2019t prepared to go rummaging amongst the foliage to try to find him again to take any more. This thing has large mandibles; think jaws, sort of, and I didn\u2019t want my fingers anywhere near them.\nHere\u2019s the picture, can you see him? He\u2019s in here somewhere\u2026\nLet\u2019s get a bit closer\u2026\nThis should do it\u2026\nThere are about 90 species of these bull ants here in Australia and they are as feared in the ant world as they are by humans. Get this; Queen bull ants have been known to walk straight into the nest of another species of ants, kill their Queen ant and take over the colony.\nCharming. Think \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter how big you are either, they will attack if they need to.\nGet too close to one of these ant colonies and they will be streaming out of their nest and literary chasing you. If this happens to you, don\u2019t be embarrassed, just\u2026.\nRun away!!\nThey are very aggressive and have extremely painful venomous stings.\nTheir sizes range from around 8 mm to 40 mm, the one I saw was at least 20 to 25 mm and bordering on the biggest ant I have ever seen.\nWhatever you choose to call them, bull ants, bulldog ants, jumper ants, sergeant ants, inch ants or even Mymecia if you want to get all scientific, it matters not; they are big ants and not to be messed with.\n\r\n\tThanks for visiting and I do hope you come back regularly.\n\r\n\tBob\nTagged as:\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBull Ant, \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGiant Bull Ant, \n\t\t\t\t\t\tMelbourne, \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPhillip Island\n\n{ 6 comments\u2026 read them below or add one }\nTry getting bitten on the testicle by one of these bad boys!

The construction\r\n                  of the dummy is identical to the power bogie except it does\r\n                  not contain any gearing, but it is fitted with pickups for\r\n                  improved power collection. The gear in the centre of the axle\r\n                  is kept to maintain the axle\r\n                  in the correct lateral position. As a practical measure, the\r\n                  pickups are connected to two 300mm long wires to connect to\r\n                  the power unit. \nUnfortunately,\r\n                  dummy BullAnts roll like bricks due to the resistance from\r\n                  the pickups and the bearings on each axle, this is something\r\n                  we cannot avoid, we recommend you avoid using them if possible. If you must use them, it is necessary to ensure that there is\r\n                  adequate weight over the dummy bogie. In fact, this applies\r\n                  equally to the power bogie. Depending upon the motor type and\r\n                  application, we recommend an overall weight in excess of 80\r\n                  grams but generally not exceeding 350 grams for any model fitted\r\n                  with BullAnts.\nOption: Motor \nThere is no \r\n                standard motor for a BullAnt, you need to choose a motor that has sufficient power for the job you expect it do perform. Three sizes of motor are available, the 1015, 1020 and 1024. The\r\n                motor code number relates to the size of the motor, a 1015\r\n                is 10mm across the flats and 15mm long in the body, excluding\r\n                shafts. Therefore, the 1020 and 1024 are the same diameter,\r\n                but 20 and 24mm long respectively. Both the larger motors actually\r\n                draw slightly less current than the 1015 motor. The maximum\r\n                RPM for each motor is also different, the 1015 is 16,000 RPM,\r\n                the 1020 is 15,000 RPM and the 1024 is 19,000 RPM.\nIn\r\n                general, the rule is to fit the largest size motor that will\r\n                fit in your model, in order to provide the greatest reserve\r\n                of power. The power rating of the 1015 motor is 0.35 Watt,\r\n                while the 1020 is 0.68 Watt and the 1024 is 1.00 Watt. You\r\n                can see that the 1020 is twice as powerful as the 1015, and\r\n                the 1024 is nearly 3 times as powerful. \nUnfortunately, many customers choose the 1015 motor because it is the first in the list, and this will often end up being a poor choice. The 1015 motor is a quite small motor and frankly is a bit weak for most applications. If choosing the 1015 motor, we urge you to consider a larger motor. We will not accept orders for BullAnts with 3 or more axles if the 1015 motor is selected, as the motor simply will not drive 3 or more axles. In our view, the 1015 motor is only viable with large ratio gear reductions of 30:1 or greater. Lesser ratios will produce poor low speed performance and the motor will need at least 5 to 6 volts across it to get started.\n There is a small extra cost for the\r\n                larger motors as we buy them in smaller lots.\nAll\r\n                BullAnts are fully DCC compatible such that the power pickups\r\n                and the motor connections can be separated. In choosing a\r\n                decoder for the BullAnt, any decoder with a 1 amp or greater\r\n                rating will be suitable. In fact, the stall current of a BullAnt\r\n                is well under the 1 amp limit.\nOption:\r\n                Wheel Size & Type\nAt\r\n                  the last update of this document, there were 31 different wheels\r\n                  to choose from in both disc and spoked wheels. Wheel\r\n                  sizes are quoted in both metric and imperial (inch) measurements,\r\n                the inch measurement is in brackets.\nThe\r\n                  wheel choice is quite descriptive, '9.6mm(.378\") Code 88 NS\r\n                  Disc' means an RP25 profile wheel of 9.6mm or .378 inch diameter\r\n                  with a tread\r\n                  width\r\n                  of .088\" or 2.24mm, as a nickel silver solid disc wheel. This\r\n                  wheel might also be described as a 'Code 88' or 'finescale'\r\n                  wheel. Normal tread width for most HO wheels is Code 110, meaning\r\n                  that the tread width is .11\" or 2.79mm. \nWe\r\n                  have the ability to produce solid disc wheels to your specifications,\r\n                  the minimum run is 500 wheels, call us for a quote.\nTo\r\n                  help with choosing wheels sizes, the table below equates the\r\n                  available BullAnt wheel sizes in millimetres to the actual\r\n                  wheel sizes in inches. Sizes are provided for 3 of the popular\r\n                  scales.\nOption: Rigid Centre Axle\r\n                or Lateral Action\nThe\r\n                  BullAnt and In-Line drive bogies are offered with two options\r\n                  for the fitting of the centre axles, where more than two axles\r\n                  are required. Depending upon the span of the 3 axles, or more,\r\n                  the bogie may have difficulty going around curves, as the rigid\r\n                  centre axle mounting will cause it to de-rail.\nThe\r\n                  Lateral Action feature replaces the rigid centre axle with\r\n                  a special nickel-silver gearbox that permits the axle to move\r\n                  sideways by approximately 2mm, while still engaging the gear\r\n                  drive. This means the centre axle will slide across to accomodate\r\n                  reasonably sharp curves while still retaining power to the\r\n                  centre axle. The radius of curve that it will fit is still\r\n                  determined by the overall wheelbase of the bogie. \nThis\r\n                  feature costs a little more to fit, so it comes with a higher\r\n                  price compared to the simple rigid axle option.\nThe\r\n                  rigid centre axle feature may be preferred where there are\r\n                  4 axles required or the modeller feels that the total wheelbase\r\n                  is short enough to not cause concern, or the curve radius'\r\n                  used is large enough to cope.\nOption: Tram or Trolley\r\n                Wiring\nIf\r\n                  you intend to use your BullAnt in a tram or trolley and\r\n                  would like the BullAnt to be wired accordingly, there is an\r\n                  optional wiring scheme that costs no extra. \nThe\r\n                  first option has all wheels connected together with a longer\r\n                  free red wire\r\n                    coming off the motor for connection to the overhead power\r\n                  collection system. This assumes that you will reverse the power\r\n                  collection to change the direction of the model.\nThe\r\n                  second option connects all wheels together and provides longer\r\n                  free black and red wires to be used for trolley pole reverse\r\n                  operation, where the trolley poles and hooks control the direction\r\n                  of travel. The wiring diagram for this scheme is shown below.\n\nOption:\r\n                Track Gauge\nAt\r\n                  present we offer the Bullant in 9, 10.5, 12, 14.2 & 16.5mm\r\n                  track gauges. These gauges are also listed as their common\r\n                  gauge such as  HOn3, TT and HO/00 respectively. \nPlease\r\n                  note that while we do make mechanisms to 9mm gauge, we do not\r\n                  make these items to N scale. The 9mm gauge is offered for modellers\r\n                  who require a narrow gauge in a larger scale. In many cases,\r\n                  these mechanisms may be too large for N scale.\nWe\r\n                    may add to this range as demand dictates.\r\n                      Every gauge added to the list requires different length\r\n                  axles and jigs to assemble the wheel sets with the correct\r\n                  back-to-back\r\n                measurement. If you want a gauge that is not offered, please\r\n                  email us and enquire, we may be able to help.\nOption: Flywheel\nThis\r\n                  is a delete option, that is, the BullAnt is supplied with a\r\n                  flywheel as standard. If you do not want the flywheel fitted,\r\n                  you can select 'No Flywheel' and you will have the cost of\r\n                  the flywheel deducted from the total. If the flywheel is not\r\n                  fitted, then you can choose to have the motor shaft trimmed\r\n                  back to the rear of the motor, or left as it is.\nThe\r\n                  flywheel fitted to the motor is the largest effective flywheel\r\n                  we could fit. Fitting a shorter flywheel\r\n                  of similar diameter will have little effect, as the diameter\r\n                  has a greater influence over flywheel action than length and\r\n                  there is virtually no room to increase the diameter.\nOption: Wheelbase\nThis\r\n                  box is mandatory for all BullAnt products. The wheelbase is\r\n                  the distance from the centre of one axle to the centre of the\r\n                  next. You should simply type a number in this box corresponding\r\n                  to the desired wheelbase, acurate to the nearest 0.25mm or\r\n                  .01\". You can enter the wheelbase in metric form as eg: 22.5\r\n                  or in inches as .886\"\nIf\r\n                      you have chosen a BullAnt with more than two axles, type\r\n                    the first axle to axle distance, then a + symbol and then the\r\n                    next\r\n                distance, and so on. \nThe\r\n                  axles can be at different spacings if you wish, but please\r\n                  make sure the wheel sizes do not cause an overlap. The BullAnt\r\n                  gear box will be at the start of the specification, so if you\r\n                  typed 20 + 30 +40, then the gearbox will automatically be placed\r\n                  at the 20 end.\nThe\r\n                  minimum practical wheelbase is 17mm, although the design\r\n                  of the BullAnt allows for an absolute minimum wheelbase of\r\n                  11.5mm.\r\n                  If you specify a wheelbase less than 17mm, the sideframe\r\n                  mount bolster may not be fitted nor will pickups be fitted.\r\n                  The pickups\r\n                  will be packed in the box with the BullAnt however, so you\r\n                  can arrange to fit them yourself.\nThe\r\n                  table below shows some popular wheelbases in feet and inches\r\n                  equated to the scale size in millimetres. Conversions are shown\r\n                  for 3 of the popular scales. The resultant wheelbases have\r\n                  been taken to the nearest 1/4 millimetre as this is the accuracy\r\n                  we work to.\nOption: Mounting Bolster\nThis\r\n                  is a new option, you can choose the size of nickel silver bolster\r\n                  for mounting the BullAnt to your model. There are two types\r\n                  of bolster, a cross mounting and an end mounting, and you can\r\n                  order any type as swiveling or fixed. There are, in addition,\r\n                  three sizes for each bolster. \n\nThe\r\n                  plain bolsters on the left are the cross mounting versions\r\n                  and the 3 on the right are the end or cantilever mount versions.\r\n                  The cross bolsters have had the side fold removed to make it\r\n                  simpler to mount the BullAnt, but the end mounts retain the\r\n                  folds. The mounting holes are all 2.0mm diameter and the spacing\r\n                  between the two holes on the end mount versions is 3.5mm. The\r\n                  mounting hole centres for the 20, 26 and 32mm cross mounts\r\n                  are respectively 17, 23 and 29mm. The distance from the bogie\r\n                  mounting hole to the centre line of the end mounts for the\r\n                  26, 32 and 38mm end mounts are respectively 22.9, 28.9 and\r\n                  34.9mm.\nThe\r\n                  26mm end mount is suitable for BullAnts with wheelbases up\r\n                  to 38mm, the 36mm mount suits wheelbases up to 46mm and the\r\n                  38mm suits wheelbases up to 50mm. The next photo shows how\r\n                  this mount might be used.\nYou\r\n                  also have the option of having the bolster swivelling, which\r\n                  would be the normal case, so the bogie can rotate in the\r\n                  model, or fixed. The fixed option has the bolster attached\r\n                  (soldered) to the spine section so it does not rotate. This\r\n                  option is quite often used where the unit is fitted to a fixed\r\n                  wheelbase model. Note that each bolster option has the choice\r\n                  of swivelling or fixed. \nSome\r\n                  modellers will prefer to have extra fixed bolsters to make\r\n                  the attachment to their model\r\n                    easier. If this is the case, please leave us a note in the\r\n                  comments section of the order.\n\nThree new mounts have been introduced to help make\r\n                bogie mounting more flexible. These mounts have a wider spread\r\n                at the ends, with 2mm diameter holes placed 11.5mm apart. They\r\n                are otherwise the same length as the standard 20, 26 and 32mm\r\n                mounts, and the hole centres are the same, at 17mm for the 20mm\r\n                mount, 23 for the 26 and 29 for the 32.\nThe total width of the widened section is 15.5mm.\r\n                The Bat Wings will restrict rotation of the bogie slightly, but\r\n                should not affect the rotation for all but the most extreme\r\n                angles.\n\nQuantity & Select\r\n                Fields\nTo\r\n                  the right of the Product Option column, there is a quantity\r\n                  field that defaults to one unit, so if you wish to order more\r\n                  than one BullAnt of a given specification, enter the quantity\r\n                  in this field. The Select field must be clicked to order the\r\n                  product, and will display a tick. You can de-select the product\r\n                  by clicking the Select field again. You can also order a dummy\r\n                  unit at the same time by filling in the fields and selecting\r\n                  the dummy.\nTo\r\n                  order a BullAnt of a different specification, click on the\r\n                  'Order Selected Products' button at the bottom of the page\r\n                  and you will be shown the contents of your shopping list. Then\r\n                  select 'Continue Shopping' to order a BullAnt of a different\r\n                  specification.\nThe\r\n                  shopping cart page also gives you the ability to calculate\r\n                  the cost of your purchase to date in other currencies, there\r\n                  is a link to X-Rates under the summary box. \nLocal Taxes - GST\nAustralian\r\n                  purchasers must pay the Goods and Services Tax, it is included\r\n                  in the price. Overseas purchasers do not pay this tax, and\r\n                  it will be automatically deducted from the price if you indicate\r\n                  you are an overseas customer.\nChecking Out\nAs\r\n                  part of the checkout process, we first need you to tell us\r\n                  your details so we can contact you if there is a problem with\r\n                  your order and also where you are so the program can calculate\r\n                  the shipping cost. There is a box on this page that allows\r\n                  you to enter any special notes or requests for our attention.\nBy\r\n                  clicking on 'Continue', the program will calculate the cost\r\n                  of freight and the next page gives you a number of choices\r\n                  as to which freight method you want to use.\nYou\r\n                  then see a further summary page showing the total price payable,\r\n                  with shipping included and, if you are an overseas customer,\r\n                  the GST component deducted.\nFinally,\r\n                  you will be given the choice of method to pay, and if you choose\r\n                  credit card, you will be passed through to e-Way, our payment\r\n                  gateway provider.\nIf\r\n                  in doubt, call us...\nWe\r\n                  are happy to discuss your requirements with you, so either\r\n                  send an email to sales@hollywoodfoundry.com or\r\n                  telephone us on +61 3 5629 1100.

There is no fixed wheelbase for a BullAnt, you can pretty\r\n            much choose whatever size suits.\nThe\r\n              BullAnt show below is about the smallest we can do with all features\r\n              on board. Just to put that little BullAnt into perspective, it\r\n            is only just a tad over 1 inch in length!\nHow To Order A BullAnt\nSo to help explain what the\r\n            options are about, have a look at our How To Order A BullAnt Page.\n \n\n\nThe\r\n             range of BullAnt configurations is too large to show, but the examples\r\n             shown demonstrate the ability to go from the very small 15.5 mmm\r\n             wheelbase, to the very large 45mm wheelbase at the rear. Gauges\r\n             demonstrated are 9mm, 10.5mm, 12mm & 16.5mm with wheel sizes\r\n             from 8mm up to 11.6mm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe\r\n             three axle BullAnt show below has 20mm + 20mm axle spacing, 11.6mm\r\n             disc wheels, 16.5mm (HO) Gauge and is fitted with the optional more\r\n             powerful Mashima 1024 motor. Pickups fitted to all wheels in multi-axle\r\n             configurations. Although this model has equal axle spacing, there\r\n             is no reason why the spacing between axles cannot be different.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe\r\n             BullAnt dummy bogie is simply missing the motor and gear components.\r\n             It comes supplied with pickups to extend the power collection to\r\n             the dummy. We must point out however, that these dummy units are\r\n             not particularly free-rolling due to the brass wheel bearings and\r\n             pickups adding to the rolling resistance. It is definitely recommended\r\n             to place sufficient weight on the dummy end to obtain best performance.\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\nConstruction?\nA\r\n               brass spine section carries all of the components in a strong,\r\n             rigid structure. A nickel-silver gearbox frame mounts the Mashima\r\n             MHK-1015\r\n               motor and flywheel, along with 2 brass and one Delrin helical\r\n             cut spur gears, to transmit power down to just above axle level.\r\n             Then a silver-steel horizontal\r\n               lay-shaft runs underneath the brass spine, carrying the steel\r\n             worms that provide power to the wheels. The gear ratio of 15:1 provides\r\n               a good balance of power and speed range. \nMoulded\r\n               Delrin gearbox enclosures place the axles in correct mesh with\r\n               the worms and align the axles across the assembly. Although Delrin\r\n               is an excellent bearing material in itself, each axle has two\r\n               brass bearings, one either side of the brass worm gear, to provide\r\n               excellent wheel alignment and smooth running. Two phosphor bronze\r\n               thrust washers inside the gearbox enclosures take care of thrust\r\n               loads along the layshaft.\nA\r\n               Polystyrene plastic sideframe mount has three fingers on each\r\n               side that can\r\n               be trimmed off to provide mounting for bogie sideframes at\r\n               13.3, 16.5 and 21mm inside spacing. The sideframe mount also carries\r\n               two phosphor-bronze pickups, making contact with the inside flanges\r\n               of all wheels. The wheels are solid nickel-silver,  to RP25\r\n               standard, code 88. \nA\r\n               nickel-silver bolster, attached above the sideframe mount, runs\r\n               in a Delrin turntable to provide a swivel mounting for the BullAnt\r\n               to the model. A printed circuit board attached to the rear of\r\n               the motor features an interference suppression network to make\r\n               the BullAnt CE compliant.\nPerformance?\nA\r\n               great deal of care has been taken with the design of the BullAnt\r\n               to guarantee quiet, reliable running combined with low maintenance.\r\nThe prototype BullAnt was run for 650 hours, 24 hours a day to identify wear\r\n               points. During that time, it travelled over 370 actual miles,\r\n               or 590 kilometres. \nShortly\r\n               after we started production, the moulded Delrin spur gears were\r\n               found to be unsatisafctory, so we had specially cut gears made\r\n               in a mixture of brass and Delrin with a helical tooth form to\r\n               improve smoothness and further reduce gear noise. At the same\r\n               time, we took the opportunity to add two bearings to the idler\r\n               gear as we had noticed wear in this area with the test unit.\nIf\r\n               the Mashima 1015 motor is a tad small for your application, and\r\n               you need a little more power, the larger 1020 and 1024 variants\r\n               can be supplied to order. The 1020, while providing more power,\r\n               also runs slightly slower than the standard 1015 motor, while\r\n              the 1024 runs faster.\nMore\r\n               Ratios?\nShortly\r\n               after introduction, the BullAnt will be available with a choice\r\n               of 3 gear reduction ratios. The standard ratio of 15:1 is best\r\n               suited to\r\n               larger scale narrow gauge EMU/DMU applications, while optional\r\n               ratios of 31:1 and 60:1 will be offered to provide better slow\r\n               speed performance. \n More Axles?\nAn\r\n               exclusive feature of the BullAnt design is that it provides for\r\n               3 or even 4 axles. And the axle spacing does not have to be equal\r\n               either, you will be able to individually specify the spacing for\r\n               each axle in the assembly. Even with 4 axles, you can still have\r\n               power pickup from all wheels too.\nHowever,\r\n               a word of caution, the BullAnt design provides a rigid wheelbase,\r\n               there is no lateral movement on the centre axles. This can be\r\n               a problem with 3 axle configurations where the axle spacing is\r\n               large and/or small radius curves are employed. A rigid frame of\r\n               any length can de-rail on corners and sharp points. It is not\r\n               really possible to advise a minimum radius that the BullAnt will\r\n               handle\r\n               as it is totally variable according to wheelbase, wheel size and\r\n               wheel profile.\nWe\r\n               do offer, on the other hand, an option that provides a lateral\r\n               action on the center axle. With this method, the center wheels\r\n               have a slightly narrower back to back measurement and employ a\r\n               nickel\r\n               silver wheel housing and thinned down wheel bearings. The worm\r\n               gear is also slightly thinned as well and this combination means\r\n               that there is 1.3mm of lateral movement on the center axle only.\r\n               Because of the additional time taken in the assembly of this option,\r\n              there is a price premium charged.\nReally Short & Extra Long Wheelbases?\nWith\r\n               a minimum wheelbase of 17mm and a maximum in excess of 60mm,\r\n               the BullAnt will provide a much needed power source for trams,\r\n               multiple\r\n               unit railcars, small industrial tractors and the like. If\r\n               you are prepared to delete the pickups, sideframe mount and bolster,\r\n               the BullAnt can be supplied with a tiny 11.5mm wheelbase!\nHow big is the BullAnt, will it fit my model?\nView                the\r\n               Spec Sheet in PDF format, showing typical BullAnt dimensions:               Spec\r\n               Sheet \nTo save it, right click on the link and choose 'Save\r\n                 Target as....'\nOrdering Options?\n\nWheelbase:\r\n                   From 11.5mm upwards in increments of 0.25mm. 17mm upwards\r\n                   can be fitted with pickups and bolster.\nGauges:\r\n                   16.5mm (HO) - 14.2mm (British 3mm Fine Scale - 12mm (HOm or\r\n                   HOn3 1/2) - 10.5mm (HOn3) - 9mm (HOe or HOn30\")\nWheels:\r\n                   All disc - 11.6, 10.5, 9.6 & 8mm (other wheel types will\r\n                   be added in the future)\nMotors:\r\n                   Standard, MHK1015 - Optional, MHK1020 or MHK1024\nMatching\r\n                   dummy BullAnt (non-powered)\n\nPrice? \nA\r\n               two axle BullAnt will retail at $85.00, and a dummy at $25.00\r\n               in Australian Dollars. There will be small extra charges for additional\r\n               axles or other motor combinations.\nHow Quickly Can I Get a BullAnt?\nWe have invested in specialised CNC\r\n             machinery to make the assembly of the BullAnt as quick as possible.\r\n             All orders go into a queue and are processed in sequence. We aim\r\n             to have a maximum of 7 working days from receipt of order to despatch\r\n             of that order. In any event, provided we can contact you, we will\r\n             advise you when your order is to be shipped.\nNote about Dummy BullAnt Please\r\n             note that the dummy BullAnt has exactly the same construction as\r\n             the powered BullAnt, including brass wheel bearings and these, along\r\n             with the power pickups that are fitted, mean that the dummy is not\r\n             particularly free-rolling. These features add a certain amount of\r\n             friction to the axle, and this is un-avoidable. \nAbout Running In \nA number of customers have noticed that their BullAnt is a bit\r\n             jerky in its movement when they receive it. The motor can also run\r\n             a bit warm as well. This is an indication that the BullAnt needs\r\n             to be run in.\nAlthough every BullAnt is tested and run before shipping, we strongly\r\n             recommend that you run it in  when you receive it. Some manufactuers\r\n             build their mechanisms with loose tolerances in the bearings, usually\r\n             referred to as 'slop'. We do not do this, all our bearings are made\r\n             to close tolerances and need to bed themselves in to provide optimum\r\n             performance. Unfortunately we cannot afford the time to do this\r\n             with each BullAnt at the factory, or it would increase the cost,\r\n             so we ask you to do this yourselves.\nHobby Shops, Distributors & Manufacturers?\nRetail\r\n               hobby shops and distributors are welcome.

With this method, the center wheels\r\n               have a slightly narrower back to back measurement and employ a\r\n               nickel\r\n               silver wheel housing and thinned down wheel bearings. The worm\r\n               gear is also slightly thinned as well and this combination means\r\n               that there is 1.3mm of lateral movement on the center axle only.\r\n               Because of the additional time taken in the assembly of this option,\r\n              there is a price premium charged.\nReally Short & Extra Long Wheelbases?\nWith\r\n               a minimum wheelbase of 17mm and a maximum in excess of 60mm,\r\n               the BullAnt will provide a much needed power source for trams,\r\n               multiple\r\n               unit railcars, small industrial tractors and the like. If\r\n               you are prepared to delete the pickups, sideframe mount and bolster,\r\n               the BullAnt can be supplied with a tiny 11.5mm wheelbase!\nHow big is the BullAnt, will it fit my model?\nView                the\r\n               Spec Sheet in PDF format, showing typical BullAnt dimensions:               Spec\r\n               Sheet \nTo save it, right click on the link and choose 'Save\r\n                 Target as....'\nOrdering Options?\nPrice? \nA\r\n               two axle BullAnt will retail at $85.00, and a dummy at $25.00\r\n               in Australian Dollars. There will be small extra charges for additional\r\n               axles or other motor combinations.\nHow Quickly Can I Get a BullAnt?\nWe have invested in specialised CNC\r\n             machinery to make the assembly of the BullAnt as quick as possible.\r\n             All orders go into a queue and are processed in sequence. We aim\r\n             to have a maximum of 7 working days from receipt of order to despatch\r\n             of that order. In any event, provided we can contact you, we will\r\n             advise you when your order is to be shipped.\nPlease\r\n             note that the dummy BullAnt has exactly the same construction as\r\n             the powered BullAnt, including brass wheel bearings and these, along\r\n             with the power pickups that are fitted, mean that the dummy is not\r\n             particularly free-rolling. These features add a certain amount of\r\n             friction to the axle, and this is un-avoidable. \nAbout Running In \nA number of customers have noticed that their BullAnt is a bit\r\n             jerky in its movement when they receive it. The motor can also run\r\n             a bit warm as well. This is an indication that the BullAnt needs\r\n             to be run in.\nAlthough every BullAnt is tested and run before shipping, we strongly\r\n             recommend that you run it in  when you receive it. Some manufactuers\r\n             build their mechanisms with loose tolerances in the bearings, usually\r\n             referred to as 'slop'. We do not do this, all our bearings are made\r\n             to close tolerances and need to bed themselves in to provide optimum\r\n             performance. Unfortunately we cannot afford the time to do this\r\n             with each BullAnt at the factory, or it would increase the cost,\r\n             so we ask you to do this yourselves.\nHobby Shops, Distributors & Manufacturers?\nRetail\r\n               hobby shops and distributors are welcome. Manufacturers looking\r\n               for powertrain solutions for their models are most welcome.\n Please\r\n               contact us at sales@hollywoodfoundry.com or\r\n               telephone us on (03) 5629 1100, International +61 3 5629 1100.\r\n               Wholesale and dealer prices can be provided to legitimate businesses.\n\n\n\r\n       Hollywood Foundry - Copyright \u00a9 1999-2004 Seamist Pty.

Now if a moth dies during the night hoards of ants come in under the skirting boards to eat the body, would you believe they have eaten the silicon hubby filled the cracks up so then he filled them up with timber mate a wood filler and now they are eating that.    I can not stand any sprays, so I though I would try these  Ant baits as they work ok late last year. Two days ago I had this long trail of ants in the lounge room yes another dead moth so I followed the trail and where they were coming in under the skirting board I put one of those Ant Baits they are about 5cms square and are plastic covered seem the ants go in and eat the bait then take some back to the nest and those that eat it die, aparently it will kill the queen also. Yesterday there were no signs of ants in the house anywhere.    Now I dont know if it will kill your big ants but maybe you could give it a try, if you do you must not use any spray near the baits they are between $3-$4 a box of four from the supermarket, and if you do use them let us know how you went.Good luck with whatever you try...Cheers..MM. \nI can not stand any sprays, so I though I would try these  Ant baits as they work ok late last year.

I have found something that works wonders for us..    Borax... 20 Mule Team Borax powder in your laundry isle.    Sprinkle it anywhere and everywhere, inside, outside, in window sills, door ways, closets, porches, the ground, driveways, floors etc etc.    IT is the only thing we use now.. commerical and residental sprays and bug  killers do not work, we have tried them all.. even local pest control can not keep them away.\nBorax... 20 Mule Team Borax powder in your laundry isle.

It uses somewhat what Daisy referred to...only use boric acid....bought at any drugstore.    To two cups (450 millilitres) of boiling water, add two teaspoons of boric acid, and two cups (450 grams) of granulated sugar.  (I know how to measure metric...but I'm still not used to writing about it)     Stir to dissolve sugar fully.   Let cool.    Then, into a small container....much like a margarine container, you put holes at the sides at the bottom to let the ants enter.  Into the container you place about 6 cotton balls (also bought at the drugstore) after soaking them in the solution.  Put the lid on to prevent other insects such as bees from entering.  Then place the containers where you see the trails or mounds of ants.    The idea is for the sugar to be the come-on...the boric acid the killer.  The worker ant takes the liquid back to the nest and feeds it, like a good ant will, to Queenie..  she gets a terrible tummy ache....and the colony dies with her.    Any pointed shoe can kill an ant in the corner...it takes a wise wearer to know how to kill hundreds without putting your foot down.    Anyway, its supposed to work on the feared RED ANTS of southern U.S. so I cant see where an Ausie ant's stomach is any less upsetting.    Now there are a few more suggestions and they are talked about widely whether they, in fact, work or not.    Grits....that southern U.S. morning food.....tastes like bland cream of wheat...  well, this stuff expands when moistened and figuring an ant's stomach has such acid, it suggests when an ant eats the grits, the stuff explodes inside its stomach.    Another one....make the ant cross through some baking soda.  He gets it on his feet (or whatever an ant calls his feet), some of it gets into his mouth...and the old story....  when baking soda gets wet it turns into carbon dioxide....  GAS that is....and since an ant cant burp, cant flatulate, he goes all to pieces.

There are so many species of ants and the control methods are different for different species.  In Australia you need to ID ants so we don't have a repeat of the Red Imported Fire Ant like they have in QLD.  In West Australia you can send ants to the Pest and Diseases Information Service 3 Baron-Hay Court in South  Perth 6151 its a free service for the public  Each state should have the same sort of service.    Of course we should not rule out the problem could be bedbugs, an insect that has made a spectacular return in the last ten years\nOf course we should not rule out the problem could be bedbugs, an insect that has made a spectacular return in the last ten years\n\nAgain not sure if this works on Bull Ants but found that sprinkling a bit of Tea tree oil around where I think they're coming in got rid of my ant problem.      Supposedly ants communicate constantly via their antennae and the fumes from the oil interfere with this communication somehow.  In any event, we had a huge problem with ants last year, the bug guy sprayed, tracked them, used powder, all those horrible things to no avail.  This year I sprinkled the tea tree oil at the first sight and they vacated the premises.  If I see even one, I re-dose the area under my sink and they head for the hills.     I hope it works for you.    Flibbity\nSupposedly ants communicate constantly via their antennae and the fumes from the oil interfere with this communication somehow.

Try the chemical WEBZONE or it's generic ZUESS (Bifenthrin),it kills ants and spiders etc & has a residual effect but you need to locate the nest any nearby nests that maybe 100's of meters apart & linked by underground tunnels and spray till near run-off then dig up and spray again then cover back in and spray the disturbed area again,it works well quickly & effectively.\n\nI finally found Borax at Woolworths only a couple of days ago.\n\n Post a Follow-UpPlease Note:  Only registered members are able to post messages to this forum.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If you are a  member, please log in.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If you aren't yet a member, join now!\nReturn to the Pests & Diseases Forum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nInformation about Posting\n\n\nYou must be logged in to post a message.

Returning to France about 1540, he entered the service of the constable of Montmorency. At \u00c9couen, Bullant worked on the constable\u2019s ch\u00e2teau, which clearly evidences the effect of Bullant\u2019s exposure to the Pantheon in Rome.

The resemblance is no coincidence: Ants are believed to have evolved from wasplike ancestors some 140 million years ago. The bulldog ant has long been considered one of the oldest ant lineages. But some recent studies suggest that bulldogs appeared no earlier than 100 million years ago, along with an explosion of other ant species that may have accompanied the rise of flowering plants. Nevertheless, they exemplify the anatomy and behavior experts believe the archetypal ancestor of all ants possessed: a big body with long legs, keen vision, venom-laced stingers, and relatively solitary habits.\nWhile fossilized specimens reveal that bulldog ants were once widespread across the globe, today they are found only in Australia. Bulldog expert Bob Taylor brought me to a eucalyptus woodland near Nowra, a town south of Sydney, to track red bulldog ants, which nest there in sandy ground. We found them preying on bees and other ant species, especially carpenter ants. This is dangerous quarry, because more \"advanced\" ants such as carpenters can quickly recruit aid by sending chemical signals to their nestmates\u2014an ability bulldogs lack. With her superior vision, however, a bulldog hunter can race around a carpenter ant, leap onto its back, and thrust in her stinger before her bewildered victim has a chance to marshal a counterattack. Primitive, perhaps. But she gets the job done.\nTo capture images of bulldog life below ground, Taylor and I had to set up a life-size artificial nest and populate it with a colony taken from the wild, including its queen. We blew carbon dioxide into the nest entrance to put the ants to sleep, and started digging like mad, gathering ants as we went. Here and there stashes of larvae and pupae lay in flat-bottomed chambers, and we collected those too. But the queen in a bulldog colony dives to the farthest extremity of a nest at the slightest disturbance. By the time we finally bagged her two yards (two meters) beneath the surface, the ants had awakened, and our bodies were quivering from repeated stings. After letting the colony settle in to the artificial nest for a couple of days, I spent the next few weeks observing the more tender side of this ferocious insect."], ["Bullant Worksafe", "http://bullantworksafe.com/", "We detected that your JavaScript seem to be disabled.\nYou must have JavaScript enabled in your browser to utilize the functionality of this website.\nThe Bullant Brand is dedicated to the development of our \u201cWorksafe\u201d products, integrating TDJ Australia\u2019s experience in audio and video related products over many years and producing consumer goods for the tradesman and the DIY handyman alike.\nThe Bullant Brand is dedicated to the development of our \u201cWorksafe\u201d products, integrating TDJ Australia\u2019s experience in audio and video related products over many years and producing consumer goods for the tradesman and the DIY handyman alike."], ["BullAnt, BullAnt Security WA, Locksmith WA, Security Perth ...", "http://www.bullantsecurity.com.au/", ""]]], "carpenter bee": ["https://www.google.com/search?num=20&q=carpenter+bee", [["Carpenter bee - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpenter_bee", "Carpenter bees (the genus Xylocopa in the subfamily Xylocopinae) are large bees distributed worldwide. Some 500 species of carpenter bees are in the 31 subgenera.[1] Their common name is because nearly all species build their nests in burrows in dead wood, bamboo, or structural timbers (except those in the subgenus Proxylocopa, which nest in the ground). Members of the related tribe Ceratinini are sometimes referred to as \"small carpenter bees\".\n\n\nThe genus was described by French entomologist Pierre Andr\u00e9 Latreille in 1802. The name is derived from the Ancient Greek xylokopos/\u03be\u1fe6\u03bb\u03bf\u03ba\u1f40\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 \"wood-cutter\".[2]\nIn several species, the females live alongside their own daughters or sisters, creating a small social group. They use wood bits to form partitions between the cells in the nest. A few species bore holes in wood dwellings. Since the tunnels are near the surface, structural damage is generally minor or nonexistent.[3]\nCarpenter bees can be important pollinators on open-faced flowers, even obligate pollinators on some, such as the maypop (Passiflora incarnata), though many species are also known to \"rob\" nectar by slitting the sides of flowers with deep corollas.\nIn the United States, two eastern species, Xylocopa virginica and Xylocopa micans, are found, and three other species are primarily western in distribution, Xylocopa varipuncta, Xylocopa tabaniformis orpifex and Xylocopa californica. X. virginica is by far the more widely distributed species.[4] Some are often mistaken for bumblebee species, as they can be similar in size and coloration, though most carpenter bees have a shiny abdomen, while in bumblebees the abdomen is completely covered with dense hair. Males of some species have a white or yellow face, where the females do not; males also often have much larger eyes than the females, which relates to their mating behavior. Male bees are often seen hovering near nests, and will approach nearby animals. However, males are harmless, since they do not have a stinger.[5] Female carpenter bees are capable of stinging, but they are docile and rarely sting unless caught in the hand or otherwise directly provoked.[4]\nMany Old World carpenter bees have a special pouch-like structure on the inside of their first metasomal tergite called the acarinarium where certain mites (Dinogamasus species) reside as commensals. The exact nature of the relationship is not fully understood, though in other bees that carry mites, they are beneficial, feeding either on fungi in the nest, or on other, harmful mites.\nCarpenter bees are traditionally considered solitary bees, though some species have simple social nests in which mothers and daughters may cohabit. However, even solitary species tend to be gregarious, and often several nest near each other. When females cohabit, a division of labor between them occurs sometimes, where one female may spend most of her time as a guard within the nest, motionless and near the entrance, while another female spends most of her time foraging for provisions.\nCarpenter bees make nests by tunneling into wood, vibrating their bodies as they rasp their mandibles against the wood, each nest having a single entrance which may have many adjacent tunnels. The entrance is often a perfectly circular hole measuring about 16\u00a0mm (0.63\u00a0in) on the underside of a beam, bench, or tree limb. Carpenter bees do not eat wood. They discard the bits of wood, or reuse particles to build partitions between cells. The tunnel functions as a nursery for brood and storage for the pollen/nectar upon which the brood subsists. The provision masses of some species are among the most complex in shape of any group of bees; whereas most bees fill their brood cells with a soupy mass, and others form simple spheroidal pollen masses, Xylocopa species form elongated and carefully sculpted masses that have several projections which keep the bulk of the mass from coming into contact with the cell walls, sometimes resembling an irregular caltrop. The eggs are very large relative to the size of the female, and are some of the largest eggs among all insects.[6]\nTwo very different mating systems appear to be common in carpenter bees, and often this can be determined simply by examining specimens of the males of any given species. Species in which the males have large eyes are characterized by a mating system where the males either search for females by patrolling, or by hovering and waiting for passing females, which they then pursue. In the other mating system, the males often have very small heads, but a large, hypertrophied glandular reservoir is in the mesosoma, which releases pheromones into the airstream behind the male while it flies or hovers. The pheromone advertises the presence of the male to females.[7]"], ["Carpenter Bees \u2014 Entomology \u2014 Penn State University", "http://ento.psu.edu/extension/factsheets/carpenter-bees", "\nSkip to content\nSkip to navigation\n\nXylocopa virginica \nPeople who complain about bumblebees flying about under the eaves of their homes are probably being annoyed by carpenter bees. Bumblebees are large social bees 1/2 to 1 inch long, with black and yellow or, rarely, black and orange body markings. Their nests are underground and they spend most of their time traveling between the nest and the flowers from which they obtain food.\nCarpenter bees resemble bumblebees in both size and appearance, but are not social insects. They construct their nests in trees or in frame buildings. Most of the top of the abdomen of carpenter bees is without hairs and is shiny black in color. By contrast, the abdomen of bumblebees is fully clothed with hairs, many of them yellow in color. If you see a number of large bees hovering near the eaves of the house or drilling in wood, you have carpenter bees. There is only one species of the large carpenter bees,\r\n \r\n  Xylocopa virginica, which is encountered in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe male bee is unable to sting. It is the male carpenter bee, which is most often noticed. They hover in the vicinity of the nest and will dart after any other flying insect that ventures into their territory. A common behavior of the males is to approach people if they move quickly or wave a hand in the air. The males may even hover a short distance from people causing unnecessary panic. The female however, is capable of stinging but seldom does. She must be extremely provoked (i.e. handled) before she will sting.\n\r\n While the damage to wood from the drilling activities of a single bee is slight, the subsequent year's broods will expand the tunnel through branching activities and may cause considerable structural damage. Additionally, they will commonly defecate on the wall or other item directly below the opening causing stains.\n\r\n Carpenter bees do not eat wood. They excavate the tunnels for shelter and as chambers in which to rear their young. They usually attack unpainted objects such as doors, windowsills, roof eaves, shingles, railings, telephone poles, and sometimes wooden lawn furniture.\n\r\n A carpenter bee begins her nest by drilling a nearly perfectly round entrance hole (about 1/2 inch diameter) into the wood. This hole is usually against the grain of the wood. When the tunnel is about 1 inch deep, the bee turns at right angles to the initial hole and tunnels with the grain of the wood. Bees prefer to attack wood that is greater than two inches thick.\n\r\n Young adult male and female bees hibernate in the tunnels during the winter. They mate in the spring and set about to clean out and enlarge the old tunnels or to excavate new ones as brood chambers for their young. Each chamber is provisioned with a portion of \"bee bread\", a mixture of pollen and regurgitated nectar, which serves as food for the larvae. An egg is deposited on the food supply and each chamber is sealed off. There are typically 6 to 8 chambers created by the female. The larvae that hatch from the eggs complete their development and pupate. Newly developed adult carpenter bees emerge in August, feed on nectar and return to the tunnels to over-winter.\n\r\n Locate the wood in which the bees are active and apply an insecticidal dust directly into nest openings. This is best accomplished by using a duster that will puff the dust up into the tunnel and coat the sides. To avoid possible stings, treat the area at night. Use a flashlight, over which a piece of red cellophane has been taped. The bees cannot see the red light, but you should be able to see the openings. If you must treat during the daytime, use a pyrethrum spray or wasp and hornet spray to knock down any bees flying about. It is advisable to wear protective clothing, gloves, goggles and a respirator or dust mask because the insecticidal dust will frequently become airborne and may drop down onto you as you dust the tunnel. Launder any contaminated clothing immediately (do not mix with other household laundry items) and take a shower to remove and insecticidal dust. Because of the obvious risks associated with treating carpenter bee holes in eaves or soffits, many homeowners will contract with a licensed pest control company to provide this service.\n\r\n Do not plug the holes immediately! The bees should be able to pass freely through the nest entrance where they will contact the dust and distribute it inside the tunnels. Also any new matured bees will emerge through the openings and contact the dust placed there. It is a good idea to treat in the spring, when bees are first observed, again in mid-summer to kill any bees which may not have acquired a sufficient treatment when they emerged, and a third time in early fall to contact any over-wintering bees occupying the tunnels. In the fall, the holes should be filled with wood putty or wooden dowels and the entire wood surface painted or varnished. Stained wood is not usually protected from attack.\n\r\n Pesticides are poisonous. Read and follow directions and safety precautions on labels. Handle carefully and store in original labeled containers out of the reach of children, pets, and livestock. Dispose of empty containers right away, in a safe manner and place. Do not contaminate forage, streams, or ponds.\n\n\r\n  Authored by: Steve Jacobs, Sr. Extension AssociateRevised January 2014\nPenn State College of Agricultural Sciences research, extension, and resident education programs are funded in part by Pennsylvania counties, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\nVisit Penn State Extension on the web: http://extension.psu.edu\n\nWhere trade names appear, no discrimination is intended, and no endorsement by Penn State Cooperative Extension is implied.\nThis publication is available in alternative media on request.\nPenn State is an equal opportunity, affirmative action employer, and is committed to providing employment opportunities to minorities, women, veterans, individuals with disabilities, and other protected groups.

Carpenter bees, like their distant relatives, the carpenter ants, differ from termites in that they do not consume the wood as food. They simply excavate tunnels for nesting sites. \n \nBIOLOGY\nCarpenter bees overwinter as adults, often inside old nest tunnels. They \r\n        emerge in April and May with the males usually the first to appear. Males \r\n        can be distinguished from females by a whitish spot on the front of the \r\n        face. The males do not have stingers, but they are territorial and will \r\n        harass other bees and people who venture near their protected areas. Females \r\n        can sting, but rarely do so unless confined in your hand or are highly \r\n        agitated. They feed on plant nectar, then begin constructing new tunnels \r\n        in a few weeks. The entrance holes start upward (or inward) for about \r\n        one-half inch or more, then turn horizontally and follow the wood grain. \r\n        The galleries typically run six to seven inches, but may exceed one foot. \r\n        Occasionally, several bees use the same entrance hole, but they have individual \r\n        galleries branching off of the main tunnel. If the same entrance hole \r\n        is used for several years, tunnels may extend several feet in the wood. \r\n        Inside her gallery, the female bee gradually builds a large pollen ball \r\n        which serves as food for her offspring. She deposits an egg near this \r\n        pollen ball and then seals off this section of tunnel with a partition \r\n        made of chewed wood. She constructs additional cells in this manner until \r\n        the tunnel is completely filled, usually \r\n        with six to seven cells (depending on length of the tunnel). These \r\n        adult bees die in a matter of weeks. The eggs hatch in a few days and \r\n        the offspring complete their development in about 5 to 7 weeks. Adults \r\n        begin to emerge in later summer. Although the bees remain active, feeding \r\n        on pollen the general area, they do not construct new tunnels, but may \r\n        be seen cleaning out old tunnels which they will use as overwintering \r\n        sites when the weather turns cold. \n\nAlthough it is a time-consuming \r\n        and seemingly endless task,  \r\n        treating the entrance holes with an insecticidal spray or dust can reduce\r\n           future \r\n        nesting activity.\r\n        Products containing carbaryl (Sevin), cyfluthrin or resmethrin among\r\n        other chemicals are suitable. A list of chemicals for use against carpenter\r\n        bees can be found in the North Carolina Agricultural Chemicals Manual.\r\n Avoid inhaling the insecticide or\r\n         contaminating  your clothing with the spray. Always stand upwind\r\n         from the surface  you're treating. Treated tunnels should be sealed\r\n         with a small ball of aluminum foil and  caulked after  24-36 hours.\r\n         Since active or abandoned tunnels may be used as overwintering sites\r\n         or can be re-used next spring for nesting, it is important that they\r\n         be sealed. The insecticide treatment is important because it kills both\r\n         the adult bee as well as any offspring as they attempt to emerge later.\r\n         Simply plugging untreated tunnels with wire mesh or similar material\r\n         might trap bees inside, but more resourceful bees will simply chew another\r\n         exit hole.\n\nDistributed in furtherance \r\n        of the acts of Congress of May 8 and June 30, 1914.

People may be frightened by carpenter bees because of their large size, their similarity to bumble bees, and their annoying noise.\nMost carpenter bees, Xylocopa spp., are large and robust insects resembling bumblebees. Females range from about 5/8 to 1 inch long and are shiny black or with metallic blue reflections. Their abdomens are shinier than those of bumblebees with fringes of hairs on some segments. Males usually have pale hair on the thorax and the male valley carpenter bee is golden brown.\nFemale carpenter bees bore into sound wood, and sometimes decaying wood, to make nests. Nests usually consist of tunnels 1/2 inch in diameter and 6 to 10 inches deep that are partitioned into several chambers, each containing an egg and a supply of food (pollen). Carpenter bees may use old tunnels for their nests, which they occasionally enlarge; several bees may use a common entry hole connecting to different tunnels. Over a period of time, tunnels may extend as far as 10 feet into wood timbers. Tunnels are vacated after the brood\u2019s larval and pupal stages complete their development. Development from egg to adult may take about 3 months. New adults emerge in late summer, feed on nectar and pollen and overwinter, often in old tunnels they have provisioned with pollen. They emerge in spring to mate, create and provision nests, and lay eggs. There is only one generation a year.\nCarpenter bees cause damage to wooden structures by boring into timbers and siding to construct nests. The nests weaken structural wood and leave unsightly holes and stains on building surfaces. Sound, undecayed wood without paint or bark is usually selected for nests. Carpenter bees also frequently attack dead wood on trees or lumber from southern yellow pine, white pine, California redwood, cedar, Douglas fir, cypress, mimosa, mulberry, ash, and pecan trees. They avoid most hardwoods. The presence of carpenter bees around buildings and wooden structures can be annoying or even frightening; however, males cannot sting and females sting only when provoked or handled roughly.\nPrevention is the main approach to managing carpenter bees. If possible, susceptible exterior parts of a building should be constructed out of hardwoods, which are not normally attacked by the bees for nest building. On all buildings, fill depressions and cracks in wood surfaces so they are less attractive. Paint or varnish exposed surfaces regularly to reduce weathering and attack by bees. Fill unoccupied holes with steel wool and caulk to prevent their reuse. Wait until after bees have emerged before filling the tunnels. Once filled, paint or varnish the repaired surfaces. Protect rough areas, such as ends of timbers, with wire screening or metal flashing.\nCarpenter bees are generally considered beneficial insects because they help pollinate various crop and noncrop plants. Under most conditions their damage can be successfully managed using the preventive measures described above and insecticide use is not recommended. \nIf infestation is high or risk of damage to structural integrity is great, insecticides may be used to augment other methods of control. To do this, treat tunnels with adult bees in early spring before nesting activity has begun, or in fall after all adult bees have emerged and are settling in to hibernate through the winter. It does little good to treat active nests (those containing eggs, larvae, or pupae) in late spring to summer as indicated by females bringing in loads of pollen, since each brood chamber is sealed with partitions of wood particles at each end which prohibits pesticides from penetrating to the brood. These developing bees can chew their way out after the pesticide is no longer viable. It is best to treat at night when the adults have returned to the tunnel. Wait a day or two after the treatment before sealing the tunnel to make sure all adults have been exposed to the insecticide.\nApply dust formulations of insecticides or desiccant dusts into nest holes with a bulb applicator. Dusts containing pyrethrin (Drione Dust), borate or disodium octaborate tetrahydrate (Tim-bor), and pyrethroids including deltamethrin (Bonide Termite and Carpenter Ant Dust) and cyfluthrin (Tempo Dust) are currently labeled for use against carpenter bees. Avoid inhaling these materials, because they can cause serious lung irritation. Many of these products are available only to licensed pest control professionals. After the adults are killed, repair and fill holes with steel wool and caulking, then repaint or varnish the repaired surfaces.\n\nWARNING ON THE USE OF CHEMICALS\n\nRevised adaptation from Marer, P. 1991.

Sometimes the bees may bore into painted or varnished \r\n           wood. Their holes \r\n           are usually located on the underside of wood surfaces including siding, \r\n           soffits, overhangs, decks, fence posts, fascia boards and window frames. We recommend spraying twice during the spring months at intervals of 3-4 weeks.\nFor severe infestations of carpenter bees on cedar and log structures, you may need to repeat the treatments more than twice. We suggest an interval of two \r\n           weeks for spray treatments. After each spray treatment, apply D-Fense Dust or Tempo Dust \r\n           to all possible carpenter bee holes or entry points.\nIf protected from the elements like rain, this residual insecticide will last 2 \r\n           to 3 months. If applied in late winter the treatment will stay active through most of the carpenter bee season.\nIf you have a current infestation, dust with D Fense Dust    or Tempo Dust in as many carpenter bee holes as possible. Fill the B&G Dust-R Duster or your chosen duster 1/2 way with dust and dust into the openings.\n Although their holes appear only an inch or two deep, it usually extends at a 90 degree angle. The B&G Dust-R Duster comes with a curved tip that will fit into the 90 degree angles easier. The female will turn 90 degrees and bore a channel from 6 inches to as long as 4 feet.  This channel serves as a main corridor from which she will drill small chambers a few inches deep. These chambers become egg holders. She will deposit an egg, bring in some food, and then seal it off to ensure the egg's development. \n\nIt may be difficult to treat each individual gallery with dust, aerosol or liquid residual insecticides, as you can see by the  \r\n        \r\n        carpenter gallery picture, but is important if you have a current infestation.\nYou can plug up the entrances with plugs, cork, putty, or use\r\n      caulking compound. Plug the holes after all the bees are killed. \r\n      A safe time to plug entrances is in the early fall months.\r\n      If you plug up the entrances too early, you will stop the carpenter \r\n      bees from passing through the insecticide dust, and they may chew \r\n      new openings in other locations.      \nThe following year, spray early to prevent further \r\n      boring. \nGetting rid of Carpenter Bees depends on the timing of the year.  You can prevent carpenter bee infestations if you tackle the situation early enough.\nRecommended Residual Insecticide Concentrates for Carpenter Bee Prevention \n\r\n          \r\n          Carpenter Bees can look like Bumble Bees; large, with yellow and black patterns. They are about one inch and may have some metallic reflections ranging from dark blue, yellow, green or purple tints. Their abdomens are shiny, which are  different from Bumble Bees, which have more hair. They are commonly sighted in the spring hovering like a helicopter around eaves, porch rails, and under decks. Some times carpenter bees are called \"wood bees\", because they bore into wood. Carpenter Bees do not eat the wood for nutrition. Carpenter bees, as pollinators eat nectar and pollen from flowering plants. \nThe female carpenter bee bores a channel or main corridor in wood from 6 \" to as long as 4 feet to lay their eggs in \"galleries\". \r\n  She deposits an egg into the gallery, brings in a mass of pollen for the newly hatched \r\n  larvae to feed on, and then seals it all off to ensure it's development \r\n  before she repeats the process for the next egg. \n Although, they are a wood boring insect, they are not considered a \r\n  true structural pest. They do not spread through out the entire structure, \r\n  but prefer unpainted or finished wood. \nFor More Information: Carpenter Bees\n\u00a0\n\nCarpenter Bees make holes about 1/2 inch in diameter.

They excavate nests in wood decks, porches, and homes, and the males exhibit an unsettling aggressiveness. Despite their bad behavior, carpenter bees are quite harmless, and are actually excellent pollinators. Large carpenter bees belong to the genus Xylocopa.\nDescription:\n\nCarpenter bees get their name from their woodworking skills. These solitary bees excavate nest tunnels in wood, especially in lumber that is bare and weathered. Over several years, the damage to wood can become quite extensive, as the bees expand old tunnels and excavate new ones. Carpenter bees often nest in decks, porches, and eaves, putting them in close proximity to people.\n\nXylocopa bees look quite similar to bumblebees, so it's easy to misidentify them. Look at the upper side of the bee's abdomen to differentiate the two kinds of bees. While bumblebee abdomens are hairy, the top of a carpenter bee's abdomen will be hairless, black, and shiny. \nMale carpenter bees will hover around nest entrances, chasing away intruders. They lack a sting, though, so just ignore their buzzing and aggressive flights around your head. Females do sting, but only if seriously provoked. Refrain from swatting at them, and you shouldn't have to worry about carpenter bees causing you harm.\nClassification:\n\nKingdom - Animalia Phylum - Arthropoda Class - Insecta Order - Hymenoptera Family - Apidae Genus - Xylocopa\nDiet:\n\nLike honey bees, carpenter bees feed on pollen and nectar. Female bees provision their larvae with food by placing a ball of pollen and regurgitated nectar in the brood cell. Carpenter bees do not feed on wood at any time during their life cycle.\nLife Cycle:\n\nCarpenter bees overwinter as adults, usually within vacant nest tunnels. As the weather warms in spring, the adults emerge and mate. Males die after mating. Females begin excavating new tunnels or expanding tunnels from previous years. She constructs brood cells for her offspring, provisions them with food, and then lays an egg in each chamber. \n\nEggs hatch within a few days, and the young larvae feed on the cache left by the mother. Within a period of 5-7 weeks, depending on environmental conditions, the bee pupates and reaches adulthood. The new adult generation emerges in late summer to feed on nectar before settling in for the winter. \nSpecial Adaptations and Defenses:\n\nThough they are good pollinators of open-faced flowers, deeper flowers present a challenge for the large carpenter bees. To get to the sweet nectar, they will slit open the side of the flower, breaking into the nectary and robbing the flower of its juices without providing any pollination services in exchange. \nCarpenter bees practice buzz pollination, an active method of collecting pollen grains. When it lands on a flower, the bee uses its thoracic muscles to produce sound waves that shake the pollen loose.\nRange and Distribution:\n\nCarpenter bees inhabit every continent except Antarctica. About 500 species belong to the genus Xylocopa. \nAbout Education\u00a0Follow us:\n\n \n \n \n \n\nWe deliver.

Jones\rAssociate Professor, Entomology; Extension Specialist, Household and Structural Pests\nCarpenter bees are so named because they excavate galleries in wood to create nest sites. They do not consume wood. Rather, they feed on pollen and nectar. Carpenter bees are important pollinators of flowers and trees. Carpenter bees typically are just nuisance pests that cause cosmetic rather than structural damage to wood. Nonetheless, considerable wood damage can result from many generations of carpenter bees enlarging existing galleries in wood.\nLarge carpenter bees belong to the genus Xylocopa. Two native species, Xylocopa virginica and Xylocopa micans, occur in the eastern United States. There also are a number of native carpenter bees in the western United States. This fact sheet primarily pertains to X. virginica, which has the common name of carpenter bee.\nCarpenter bees are large and robust. X. virginica is three-fourths to one-inch long, black, with a metallic sheen. The thorax is covered with bright yellow, orange, or white hairs, and the upper side of the abdomen is black, glossy, and bare (Figure 1). The female has a black head, and the male has white markings on the head. Carpenter bees have a dense brush of hairs on the hind legs. \nCarpenter bees somewhat resemble bumble bees, except bumble bees have dense yellow hairs on the abdomen and large pollen baskets on the hind legs. Various species of bumble bees and carpenter bees are similar in size. Bumble bees typically nest in the ground whereas carpenter bees nest in wood.\nCarpenter bees are solitary insects that do not form colonies. Male and female carpenter bees overwinter as adults within their old nest gallery. Adults emerge in the spring (April and early May) and mate. There is one generation per year.\nThe males are not long lived, and the female carpenter bee prepares the nest. Gallery construction is a time- and energy-consuming process, and the female will preferentially refurbish an old nest rather than excavate a new one. When constructing a new nest, the female uses her strong jaws (mandibles) to excavate a clean-cut, round nest entrance hole on the lateral surface of wood in an exposed or unexposed location. This hole is slightly less than 1/2-inch wide, approximately the diameter of her body. She bores into the wood perpendicular to the grain for one to two inches then makes a right angle turn (~90\u00b0) and excavates along the wood grain for four to six inches to create a gallery (tunnel). She excavates the gallery at the rate of about one inch in six days. \nThe female bee creates a series of provisioned brood cells in the excavated gallery. The larval provision consists of a mixture of pollen and regurgitated nectar formed into a ball. The female forms a food ball at the far end of an excavated gallery, lays an egg on top of the mass, and then walls off the brood cell with a plug of chewed wood pulp. A female often creates six to 10 partitioned brood cells in a linear row in one gallery, and she dies soon thereafter. Larvae feed on the pollen/nectar food mass, which is sufficient food for them to develop to the adult stage.\nThe life cycle (egg, larva, pupa, adult) is completed in approximately seven weeks, although developmental time may vary depending on the temperature. The new adults typically remain in their gallery for several weeks then chew through the cell partitions and venture outside in late August. They collect and store pollen in the existing galleries, but also spend much of their time just huddled together inside a gallery. These new adults hibernate in galleries because they require shelter during the winter. They then emerge the following spring.\nCarpenter bees nest in a wide range of softwoods and hardwoods, particularly if the wood is weathered. Eastern species of carpenter bees prefer softwoods such as cedar, redwood, cypress, pine, and fir. The bees can more easily tunnel through woods that are soft and that have a straight grain. Western species of carpenter bees often nest in oak, eucalyptus, and redwood.\nCarpenter bees attack structural timbers and other wood products, including fence posts, utility poles, firewood, arbors, and lawn furniture. In buildings, carpenter bees nest in bare wood near roof eaves and gables, fascia boards, porch ceilings, decks, railings, siding, shingles, shutters, and other weathered wood. These bees avoid wood that is well painted or covered with bark.\nThe carpenter bee entrance hole in wood may not necessarily be in an exposed area. For example, the inner lip of fascia boards is a common site of attack. Nail holes, exposed saw cuts, and unpainted wood are attractive sites for the bees to start their excavations. \nDespite their beneficial aspect of being important pollinators of many trees and flowers, carpenter bees also may be nuisance pests around structures. Carpenter bees are noisy, which may be bothersome. These large bees create alarm when they dive-bomb or fly erratically around humans. In actuality, these are male bees, which are territorial but harmless because they lack a stinger. Only females have a stinger. Female carpenter bees are docile and are reported to sting only if handled.\nCarpenter bees create a nuisance by excavating round entry holes in wood (Figure 2) and depositing yellowish to brownish streaks of excrement and pollen on surfaces below entry holes (Figure 3). They also produce coarse sawdust from their borings. The carpenter bee gallery system is confined within the wood (Figure 4) and hence is not visible.\nCarpenter bee damage to wood initially is minor, and carpenter bees seldom cause consequential structural damage. However, their repeated colonization of the same wood can eventually cause considerable wood damage. Carpenter bees preferentially refurbish and enlarge an existing tunnel instead of boring a new one, and a gallery can extend for 10 feet if used by many carpenter bees over the years.\nCarpenter bees sometimes construct new tunnels near old ones, with infestations persisting for several years. This complex system of tunnels can result in extensive damage to wood. Wood replacement is necessary when the strength of structural members, posts, poles, and other wood products is reduced due to carpenter bee damage.\nCarpenter bees also may be indirectly responsible for unsightly wood damage when woodpeckers riddle the wood with holes searching for the developing carpenter bees to feed upon.\nWhen dealing with carpenter bees, it is preferable to locate tunnel entrances during the daytime, but treat after dark on a cool evening when carpenter bees are less active. Wear protective clothing to avoid any stings during treatment.\nKeep all exposed wood surfaces well painted with a -polyurethane or oil-base paint to deter attack by carpenter bees. Periodically inspect painted surfaces, because the coatings will begin to deteriorate due to weathering, leaving exposed wood that the bees then can easily attack. Wood stains will not prevent damage. Consider using aluminum, asbestos, asphalt, vinyl siding, and similar non-wood materials that are not damaged by carpenter bees. Seal existing gallery entrance holes to discourage carpenter bees that are looking for potential nesting sites.\nA non-insecticidal management approach is to deny carpenter bees access to their galleries by sealing each entrance hole. Thoroughly plug the hole with caulking compound, wood putty, or a wooden dowel affixed with wood glue. If possible, also fill the entire gallery system with a sealant. Carpenter bee galleries are a critical resource, since the bees spend much of their time inside a gallery, and they require its protective conditions to survive the winter. Bees that are trapped inside a caulked gallery typically will not chew out due to behavioral constraints. This barrier approach has promise for reducing future carpenter bee infestations.\nIn new nests, the single female often can be swatted and killed, or she can be captured and crushed or otherwise destroyed. Larvae and pupae can be killed by inserting a sturdy wire into the entrance hole and probing into the gallery as deeply as possible. \nA chemical treatment using an appropriately labeled insecticide can protect wood for short periods, especially in the spring and summer when carpenter bee nesting activity is apparent. Dust formulations typically provide residual effects and are effective due to the nature of carpenter bee gallery construction. Precisely inject the dust directly into each nest entrance hole and as deep into the tunnel as possible and also apply it to the adjacent wood surface. Wait for a few days before plugging entrance holes since adult bees should be allowed to pass freely to distribute the insecticide within the galleries. Newly emerged bees also will contact the dust when attempting to leave their gallery.\nFor use as a preventive, an insecticide should be applied to wood in early spring before carpenter bees begin excavating nests. The insecticide kills the bees that contact it on the wood\u2019s surface. However, a preventive approach has limitations because of the difficulty in applying a chemical to all exposed wood on the house where bees could nest. Furthermore, such insecticides usually degrade in a matter of weeks or months so repeated applications are needed to maintain a lethal dose of the insecticide. Some pest management companies report good results against carpenter bees by spraying wood with a microencapsulated pyrethroid, Demand\u00ae CS insecticide (registered for use only by licensed professional applicators), which contains the active ingredient lambda-cyhalothrin. A number of other pyrethroids (bifenthrin, cyfluthrin, deltamethrin, permethrin, etc.) also are labeled for use against carpenter bees.\nInsecticides that act as stomach poisons, such as borates, typically are ineffective against carpenter bees, which do not ingest the wood that they excavate.\nClick here for PDF version of this Fact Sheet.\nOSU Extension embraces human diversity and is committed to ensuring that all educational programs conducted by Ohio State University Extension are available to clientele on a nondiscriminatory basis without regard to race, color, age, gender identity or expression, disability, religion, sexual orientation, national origin, or veteran status.\nKeith L.

There are numerous  species of carpenter bees that inhabit a broad range of ecosystems from  tropical to subtropical to temperate. In the United   States carpenters bees can be found across the southern United States from Arizona  to Florida and in the eastern United States, north to New York.\nThese gentle giants get their name from  their life history habits of excavating precisely rounded galleries inside  wood. Using their broad, strong mandibles (jaws), they chew into dead but  non-decayed limbs or trunks of standing dead trees. Some species, like the  eastern Xylocopa virginica, occasionally  take up residence in fence posts or structural timbers, especially redwood, and  become a minor nuisance. Inside their rounded branched galleries, they form  pollen/nectar loaves upon which they lay their giant eggs (up to 15 mm long). The  female forms partitions between each egg cell by mixing sawdust and her saliva  together. These partition walls are very similar to particle board!\n\n            In this image, the carpenter bee is visible in a cell. Photo courtesy Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, Bugwood Network.\n\n            Note the complex gallery of cells in these pieces of wood excavated by carpenter bees. Note the pollen-nectar loaves in several of the cells and the partition walls separating adjacent cells. Photo by Stephen Buchmann.\nCarpenter bees are long lived, up to  three years and there can be one or two generations per year. Often newly  hatched daughters, live together in their nest with their mother. Biologists  using observation nests or X-ray imaging techniques have observed returning  foragers feeding other nest mates. These observations have led some  entomologists to consider carpenter bees primitively social. However, unlike  honey bees and bumble bees there are no queen or worker castes, only individual  males and females.\n\n            A carpenter bee pollinating flowers of aromatic sumac (Rhus aromatica).

Photo by Stephen Buchmann.\nIn our vegetable and flower gardens,  carpenter bees are generalists and may be found foraging on a number of  different species. They, like bumblebees are early morning foragers. Carpenter  bees land on flower blossoms they become living tuning forks. Using their  powerful thoracic muscles carpenter bees sonicate the dry pollen grains out of  the flower\u2019s anthers. This type of pollen gathering is called \u201cbuzz  pollination.\u201d Carpenter bees are excellent pollinators of eggplant, tomato and  other vegetables and flowers.\nFrom time to time carpenter bees are  quite ingenious in their foraging for nectar. On flowers such as salvias,  penstemons, and other long, tubular flowers the carpenter bee, due to its large  size, is unable to enter the flower opening. Instead they become nectar  robbers. Using their mouthparts they cut a slit at the base of corolla and  steal away with the nectar without having pollinated the flower.\nA widespread western US  species, Xylocopa varipuncta, has an  unusual mating system. Its green-eyed golden males (the females are all black)  have huge perfume glands in their thoraces. Territorial males take up positions  in non-flowering plants near other males. As a group (lek) they actively  release their rose-scented blend of chemicals. Females are attracted from  downwind and choose a male with which to mate.\nForest Service Home | USDA.gov | recreation.gov | USA.gov | Whitehouse.gov\nPlug-Ins | FOIA | Accessibility Statement | Privacy Policy | Important Notices | Information Quality | Photo Credits & Use"], ["large carpenter bees, Xylocopa spp.", "http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/creatures/misc/bees/xylocopa.htm", "In America north of Mexico, the subfamily Xylocopinae is composed of two  genera,\u00a0Ceratina\u00a0(small carpenter bees)  and\u00a0Xylocopa\u00a0(large carpenter bees). These bees get their  common name from their nesting habits: small carpenter bees excavate tunnels in  pithy stems of various bushes; large carpenter bees chew nesting galleries in  solid wood or in stumps, logs, or dead branches of trees (Hurd and Moure 1963).  The large carpenter bees may become economic pests if nesting takes place in  structural timbers, fence posts, wooden water tanks, or the like. The  genus\u00a0Ceratina\u00a0has 21 species in America north of Mexico, two of  which occur in Florida (Daly 1973).\u00a0Xylocopa\u00a0has seven species  in America north of Mexico, with two species found in Florida.\n\nFigure 1. Adult large carpenter bee, Xylocopa sp. Photograph by Paul M. Choate, University of Florida. \nXylocopa micans\u00a0Lepeletier is known from southeastern Virginia down the East coast  of the U.S. to Florida, west to Texas, and south to Guatemala. The typical form  of\u00a0Xylocopa virginica\u00a0(Linnaeus) is known throughout the  eastern United States southward to Texas and northern Florida; the  subspecies\u00a0Xylocopa virginica krombeini\u00a0Hurd is restricted to  Florida from Sumter and Lake Counties south to Dade County (Hurd 1955, 1961).\nAt various times, carpenter bees have been placed in the families  Anthophoridae, Xylocopidae, and Apidae. Hurd and Moure (1963) traced the taxonomic  history of these bees and found the most recent placement is within the Apidae  (Krombein 1967). This family is characterized, in part, by the jugal lobe of  the hind wing being either absent or shorter than the submedian cell and by the  forewing having three submarginal cells. Within the family, carpenter bees are  distinguished most easily by the triangular second submarginal cell, and by the  lower margin of the eye coming almost in contact with the base of the mandible  (i.e., the malar space is absent).\n The easiest method of separating Ceratina from Xylocopa is by size: Ceratina are less than 8 mm in length, whereas Xylocopa are 20 mm or larger. \n\nFigure 2. Differences in wing venation between the  small carpenter bees, Ceratina spp., and the large carpenter bees, Xylocopa spp. Drawings by Division of Plant Industry.\nXylocopa\u00a0generally  resemble\u00a0bumble bees\u00a0in size and somewhat  in color, being black, metallic bluish or greenish black, or purplish blue.  Some males have yellowish areas on the face. Both sexes may have pale or  yellowish pubescence on the thorax, legs, or abdomen, but these hairs are not  as abundant or as intensely colored as in bumble bees. Large carpenter bees are  readily distinguished from\u00a0bumble bees primarily by the absence  of pubescence on the dorsum of the abdomen, which is somewhat glossy. They also  lack a malar space (present in bumble bees), and the triangular second  submarginal cell. The two species of\u00a0Xylocopa\u00a0which occur in  Florida are the only species in the eastern United States, namely\u00a0Xylocopa\u00a0 micans\u00a0Lepeletier and\u00a0Xylocopa\u00a0 virginica\u00a0(Linnaeus).\n\nFigure 3.

The lowermost, or first, brood cell was 12 cm below the nest  entrance. Three cells had been constructed when the nesting activity was  interrupted on 13 May 1975.\n\nFigure 5.\u00a0Large carpenter bee,\u00a0Xylocopa micans\u00a0Lepeletier, nest  in twig; entire twig (top) and longitudinal section (bottom).

Wood included Taxodium, Pinus, and Juniperus.  Reports were also given for Magnolia planks and deciduous woods used in fence railings. Xylocopa  virginica selects nesting sites in well-lighted areas where the wood is not painted or covered with bark.  In general, these bees were gregarious, tending to nest in the same areas for generations.  Old nests were refurbished, but new nests were also started.  In new nests, female bees chewed their way into the wood, excavating a burrow about 15 mm in diameter.  Boring proceeded more slowly against the grain (about 15 mm a day) than with the grain.  The direction of galleries in the wood appeared to depend on the direction of the grain.  If the grain were oriented vertically, the nests were vertical; if horizontally, then the nests were horizontal with respect to the ground.  Galleries extended about 30 to 45 cm in newly completed nests.  New tunnels were smooth and uniform throughout, but older galleries showed evidence of less uniformity with random depressions and irregularities.  These older galleries were believed to\r\n  have been used by several generations of bees.  After excavating the gallery, female bees gathered pollen, which was mixed with regurgitated nectar.  The pollen mass was placed at the end of a gallery (or bottom if the nest were vertical), an egg was laid, and the female placed a partition or cap over the cell composed of chewed wood pulp.  This process was repeated until a linear complement of six to eight end-to-end cells was completed.  Females apparently constructed only one nest per year in the North; bees emerged in the late summer and overwintered as adults with mating taking place in the spring.  In Florida, however, Hubbard (in Howard 1892) reported at least two generations per year with broods in February-March and during the summer.  Bees were active from November to January and from April to summer.\" \n\r\n  Chandler (1958) lists four types of damage done by carpenter bees:  weakening of structural timbers,  gallery excavation in wooden water tanks (especially in arid western areas), defecation streaking on houses or painted structures, and human annoyance.  The last point is included since carpenter bee females may sting (rarely), and male bees may hover or dart at humans who venture into the nesting area.  In general, carpenter bees are not much of a problem.\r\n  \nCarpenter bees rarely attack painted or varnished wood. These bees often  cause problems on structures by boring into the surface of the wood \u00a0used as the back face of the trim under the  eaves, as this surface is usually not painted. A buzzing or drilling sound is  heard when the bee is boring into the wood. If the hole is not visible, often  the case when the bee is boring into the backside of trim, look for sawdust on  the ground under the hole.\n\nFigure 6. Entry hole drilled into structural wood by a  large carpenter bee, Xylocopa sp. Photograph by University of Florida.\n\nFigure 7. Internal damage to structural wood by a large  carpenter bee, Xylocopa sp., showing individual larval cells. Photograph by University of Florida.\nIf problems do arise, use a small amount of insecticide that is labeled  for bees and wasps: this can be dust, wettable powders, microencapsulated  products, or aerosols. The labeled pesticide should be blown into the nesting  holes. This is more safely done with aerosols than with the other formulations.  After a few days, the holes should be plugged with plastic wood, putty, or  similar substance to allow the adult female to become exposed to the pesticide."], ["Carpenter Bees | University of Kentucky Entomology", "http://www2.ca.uky.edu/entomology/entfacts/ef611.asp", "\u00a0 \nIn the late-spring and early summer, homeowners often notice large, black   bees hovering around the outside of their homes. These are probably carpenter   bees searching for mates and favorable sites to construct their nests. Male   carpenter bees are quite aggressive, often hovering in front of people who are   around the nests. The males are quite harmless, however, since they lack   stingers. Female carpenter bees can inflict a painful sting but seldom will   unless they are handled or molested.\n\u00a0\nCarpenter bees resemble bumble bees, but the upper surface of their abdomen   is bare and shiny black; bumble bees have a hairy abdomen with at least some   yellow markings.\r\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDespite their similar appearance, the nesting habits of the two types of   bees are quite different. Bumble bees usually nest in the ground whereas   carpenter bees tunnel into wood to lay their eggs. Bare, unpainted or weathered   softwoods are preferred, especially redwood, cedar, cypress and pine. Painted or   pressure-treated wood is much less susceptible to attack. Common nesting sites   include eaves, window trim, facia boards, siding, wooden shakes, decks and   outdoor furniture. \n\u00a0\nCarpenter bees overwinter as adults in wood within abandoned nest tunnels.   They emerge in the spring, usually in April or May. After mating, the fertilized   females excavate tunnels in wood and lay their eggs within a series of small   cells. The cells are provisioned with a ball of pollen on which the larvae feed,   emerging as adults in late summer. The entrance hole and tunnels are perfectly   round and about the diameter of your finger. Coarse sawdust the color of fresh   cut wood will often be present beneath the entry hole, and burrowing sounds may   be heard from within the wood. Female carpenter bees may excavate new tunnels   for egglaying, or enlarge and reuse old ones. The extent of damage to wood which   has been utilized for nesting year after year may be considerable. \n\u00a0\nCarpenter bees prefer to attack wood which is bare, weathered and unpainted.   Therefore, the best way to deter the bees is to paint all exposed wood surfaces,   especially those which have a history of being attacked. Wood stains and   preservatives are less reliable than painting, but will provide some degree of   repellancy versus bare wood. To further discourage nesting, garages and   outbuildings should be kept closed when carpenter bees are actively searching   for nesting sites. \n\u00a0\nLiquid sprays of carbaryl (Sevin), chlorpyrifos (Dursban), or a synthetic   pyrethroid (e.g., permethrin or cyfluthrin) can be applied as a preventive to   wood surfaces which are attracting bees. Residual effectiveness of these   insecticides is often only 1-2 weeks, however, and the treatment may need to be   repeated. Tunnels which have already been excavated are best treated by puffing   an insecticidal dust (e.g., 5 percent carbaryl) into the nest opening. Aerosol   sprays labeled for wasp or bee control also are effective. Leave the hole open   for a few days after treatment to allow the bees to contact and distribute the   insecticide throughout the nest galleries. Then plug the entrance hole with a   piece of wooden dowel coated with carpenter's glue, or wood putty. This will   protect against future utilization of the old nesting tunnels and reduce the   chances of wood decay. \n\u00a0\nAlthough carpenter bees are less aggressive than wasps, female bees   provisioning their nests will sting. Treatment is best performed at night when   the bees are less active, or while wearing protective clothing.\n\u00a0\nRevised: 2/94 \n\u00a0\nCAUTION!

Ornamental trees are blooming, flowers are growing and insects are awakening. This is an exciting time of year. Mother nature gets to show us that she is omnipotent \u2013 nothing can stop her. And one of her creatures which is active now is the carpenter bee. Carpenter bees are prevalent throughout the United States. Although there are different species, the most common is big and resembles a bumble bee. You may find it foraging around flowers, shrubs and under the eaves of buildings. This bee is unique from most because it will bore into wood to make its home. They are a nuisance and can cause damage to any wood on your property. They also bother homeowners by \u201cattacking\u201d them though they rarely sting. To keep your building free of carpenter bees, you must know their biology and habits.\n\u00a0\nCarpenter bees bore holes into wood overhangs, fence posts, and trees. They will crawl between cracks of siding and roofing. When they bore in wood, the hole they drill is about 1/2\u2033 wide. This hole will go straight an inch or two and then turn 90 degrees. The following video shows close up a freshly drilled hole with a female carpenter bee just inside.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nThis new portion of the nest becomes an egg chamber. Eggs are laid at the end of these chambers and many times in \u201csub\u201d chambers which stem off the main chamber. Food is placed alongside the egg and then capped and sealed tight. It is common for an egg chamber to be two or more feet long with 10 or more sub chambers. Here is what a typical carpenter bee hole will look like when seen on a 2\u00d74 piece of pine.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nIf you could \u201cpeer\u201d inside a hole, the typical chamber would look like this.\n\n\n\nTypically the female carpenter bee will stand guard at the nest entry hole. She will defend the nest aggressively and she is armed with a stinger. Once the drilling has been completed, she will spend her days foraging for food. You may find her working Azaleas, Bradford Pears, Daffodils, Pansies and any plant which will provide pollen in early spring.\n\n\nMale bees will be hanging around these same plants hoping to find a receptive female who is still interested in finding a mate. The male bees are naturally curious and will buzz around anything moving including people, pets just about anything they see moving. This buzzing scares people into thinking they are being \u201cattacked\u201d. In fact, the male bee does not have a stinger! He has a distinctive yellow face, which may be seen while he is in flight.\n\n\nFemale bees have no interest other than collecting food. As stated above, they have a stinger but their face is black which is in contrast to the male bees. Carpenter bees are commonly mistaken for bumble bees. There are two main differences.\n1) Carpenter bees are generally larger.\n2) Carpenter bees have an abdomen which is shiny, metallic and black in color. Their abdomen has no body hair. Bumblebees have yellow and black body hair on all body parts. The following video shows a female carpenter bee closeup as she is chewing an entrance hole to a newly formed nest. Note her shiny metallic abdomen.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to \u201cattacking\u201d residents, carpenter bees are a problem because they tend to return to the same wood or location where they were born. Old nests are used year after year. If the original nest is occupied, other female bees will drill new nests. A single nest one year will become two or three the next. Problems rapidly escalate and soon you may have hundreds of holes.\n\n\nWhen you have numerous carpenter bee nests, you will have numerous larva. The larva of carpenter bees is large and noisy. They make enough noise to attract woodpeckers. Buildings which have woodpeckers damaging exposed wood probably has some type of larval activity which is attracting the birds. This insect is most likely carpenter bee larva.\n\n\nTo get rid of carpenter bees, you must think long term. The nuisance male bees are easy to kill with PT-515 WASP FREEZE. Try to get as close to them as possible and then spray directly at them making sure to keep the spray on them as long as it takes to kill them. This is usually 3-5 seconds. If you have a lot of females which are boring or hanging around looking for a place to bore, they can be a little tougher to kill. Use the BEE AND HORNET KILLER which seems to work a little faster with less waste.\nPT-515: http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/aerosol/pt-515-wasp-freeze-18-oz\nBee Hornet Freeze: http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/aerosol/hornet-killer-15-oz\n\n\nUnfortunately, killing the male bee will do nothing to stop the cycle. You must treat the nest with some material which will last a long period of time so it will effectively stop the larva. If you spray liquid residuals in their hole, you may kill the female. The eggs are protected, however, and six to twelve months later the larva will emerge. Since liquids are absorbed by porous wood, the treatment will be gone when the larva finally hatches. This means the larva have a strong chance of survival.\n\n\nTo insure complete control, use a dust called DRIONE. It has a desiccant (dehydrating) action and when the larva emerge they will be killed quickly. It is recommended that entry holes are treated with Drione and then sealed using a special 1/2\u2033 CORK. This will protect the dust from breaking down and enable it to last long enough to kill any emerging larva in the future.\nDrione: \u00a0http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/dust/drione-dust\nCorks: \u00a0http://www.bugspraycart.com/equipment/equipment-plugs/cork-12\n\n\nPlugging the holes with a cork instead of using wood filler means the tunnels will be accessible for emerging bees when they hatch from their protective egg chambers. When they do finally emerge (which will be either later this year or early next year), the bees will crawl over the Drione and meet their demise. Too many times we get calls from customers who have used silicone sealant to \u201cfill\u201d the holes instead of just capping it with a cork.\nThe problem with filling the tunnels with a sealant is that emerging young will not be able to move over the Drione. In fact they\u2019ll be forced to drill new exit holes which will be chemical free. Many times these nests will lead into the home or some other location that\u2019s hard to see or treat. To avoid this complication, do not seal the holes. Instead, cap them with corks and allow the tunnels to stay open and useable by bees that are not yet fully developed or active.\nLastly, the other benefit of using corks is that they will enable you to tell which holes have been treated and which (if any) are new.\n\n\nSince the holes can penetrate several feet, you will need to use an applicator like a HAND DUSTER. This tool will help you to apply the dust with enough force to reach deep in the nest where the eggs and larva will be living. Here is a video showing just how to treat their nests using a hand duster.\nHand Duster: http://www.bugspraycart.com/equipment/dusters/crusader\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have a lot of holes to treat, you should consider the DUST-R. This device holds almost a whole pound of Drione and because of it\u2019s unique pump handle design, requires very little effort to treat a hole. For large jobs, it\u2019s a real help. Nests can be treated in a couple of seconds. If the holes are just out of reach, use the LONG REACH DUST-R which is essentially the same device except it has a series of extensions that lengthen the unit to over 7 feet long. This means the average person standing on the ground can treat nests over 12 feet high without the use of a ladder!\nDust-R: \u00a0http://www.bugspraycart.com/equipment/dusters/bg-1152-a-qt-duster\nLong Reach Dust-R: \u00a0http://www.bugspraycart.com/equipment/dusters/bg-long-reach-dust-r\n\n\nFor really high nests, the DUSTICK or the DUSTICK DELUXE KIT might be the tool for the job. This duster is over 20 feet long and can be used to access nests which are over 25 feet up with little effort! It\u2019s also a great tool for infestations where carpenter bees are foraging under facia boards or siding which take forever to treat using a ladder. This video shows the Dustick being used.\nDustick: \u00a0http://www.bugspraycart.com/equipment/dusters/dustick\n\n\n\n\n\nTo get rid of carpenter bees that are foraging to start new nests, you must first finish all exposed wood with a protective paint. A hard finish may deter carpenter bees. However, the author has had his own home attacked and the bees didn\u2019t seem to notice the freshly painted surfaces. The Latex paint which was just applied didn\u2019t seem to slow them down at all. Furthermore, the author has seen them bore through varnish, stain and just about any type of finish. Since cellulose is where they want to call home, wood used on any structure may become a target. If the structure is a log cabin or one with natural wood siding with shakes that are exposed, expect to be attracting carpenter bees every season. All wood gives off a decay odor which attracts these bees and once the structure is found the bees will start their nest making. \n\n\nTo stop them from boring new nests, spray CYPERMETHRIN. This product is active against many pests including carpenter bees. Mix it at the rate of 1 ounce per gallon and spray it on any wood surface where carpenter bees may want to bore into wood trying to create a nest. One gallon can treat 500-1000 sq/ft. This application rate works well when treating cedar homes and log cabins. These structures are particularly subject to carpenter bees. If you want to keep them natural it means you will have to do more spraying to keep away carpenter bees and other wood destroying pests.\nCypermethrin: http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/liquid/viper-cypermethrin\n\n\nApply the Cypermethrin once every 2-4 weeks in the spring when carpenter bees are most active. Once a month applications throughout the summer will probably provide protection but you may need to increase the applications to every 2-4 weeks in the fall as well to get a complete season of carpenter bee control. Although rain and humidity will break down the chemical, it is active enough so that even trace amounts will chase these bees away and force them to find and build nests elsewhere.\u00a0 Most any SPRAYER will do the job and we\u2019ve got a few that can reach up 20 feet or more making the treatment more effective. This video shows that a \u201cpinstream\u201d spray is best suited for reaching those overhangs and other high places where carpenter bees will many times want to nest.\nPump Sprayer: http://www.bugspraycart.com/good/pump-sprayers\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that you have the chemical and sprayer, be sure to get good coverage when treating by spraying high and wide. Remember that spot applications are not suggested. In other words, if you have activity in one section of an overhang, be sure to treat all of it since the carpenter bees will probably just move to the untreated section. Since they can sense the Cypermethrin, they tend to avoid where it was sprayed and move to areas which are not protected. Generally, after they find it at several places on your home, they will leave altogether. Remember also that old holes release odors and smells that tend to attract new carpenter bees looking for a good nest sight so be sure to treat as many as possible with Drione and seal them up. This will insure they don\u2019t become a \u201crecycled\u201d nest. If they are too high to access, be sure to spray them with the Cypermethrin which should offer some protection. This will make the carpenter bees avoid the area and help to mask the hole\u2019s odor so it won\u2019t be able to attract as many.\n\n\nFor longer lasting bee repellency, be sure to add some NBS REPELLENT\u00a0to your paint/stain the next time you finish your home. Just adding it the paint you plan on using to repair and seal the nests you treat can help as well. NBS is an organic insect repellent. Formulated to be used by adding it to any paint or stain, you don\u2019t have to do anything odd or unusual to apply it. And treatments will last 1-2 years adding long term repellency to the exterior coating.\nNBS Repellent: \u00a0http://www.bugspraycart.com/exempt/additive/nbs-paint-additive-16-oz\n\n\nMade from plant oils, this 100% natural product isn\u2019t a pesticide and it won\u2019t kill any insect so you still need to dust with Drione to control existing populations. But bees don\u2019t like the NBS (neither do wasps and other invasive insects) and they\u2019ll avoid siding, fencing, railing, decks, logs, overhangs, soffits and pretty much any place NBS is applied.\n\n\nNBS can also be mixed with nothing but water and applied with a pump sprayer to your siding, outside furniture, trees, shrubs and any area in the yard where you\u2019ve got some unwanted insect activity. When used in water, the residual will be a lot less compared to when it\u2019s mixed with paint or stain so you\u2019ll need to apply throughout the season every 1-2 months. And remember, it\u2019s a not a pesticide so don\u2019t expect to see anything die. For that, use the Cypermethrin.\nNBS Repellent: \u00a0http://www.bugspraycart.com/exempt/additive/nbs-paint-additive-16-oz\nCome spring, insects will rebound from a long and cold winter. The carpenter bee is just one of these insects. Treat their nests directly with Drione to insure long term control. Use Cypermethrin on decks, overhangs and fence posts to stop further nests from being drilled. Carpenter bee awareness and control will help eliminate these \u201cattacking\u201d bees from harassing you, your family and your home.\n\n\n\n\nGive us a call if you need further help.

Made by Sherwin-Williams, their Duron paint line is one of the best exterior paint products on the market. It\u2019s tough as nails yet she drilled right through it no problem. So when it comes to paint; there is no product that can stop them.\nBut if you want to varnish or polyurethane your home, this type of exterior coating will slow them quite a bit. Of course this is not suggested since sealing the wood prevents it from breathing which can no doubt cause a whole other set of pest problems. But I have seen log cabin owners seal their exterior finish so it can be done and this type of finish will definitely slow them down.\nAlternatively you can opt to use one of the two sprays we have listed in our article. No doubt the Cypermethrin is the easiest to deploy since it can be sprayed with most any conventional hose end or pump sprayer. And you can apply it as needed, spray it over any type of surface and get protection from a wide range of pests since it has such a broad label. So for me, the Cypermethrin is most practical product and spraying the best method to repel these bees.\nCypermethrin: http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/liquid/viper-cypermethrin\nPump Sprayer: http://www.bugspraycart.com/good/pump-sprayers\nBut if you intend on painting or staining the home anytime soon, adding some NBS to the tank mix is a no brainer and strongly suggested. This will give you a good 6-12 months of repellency from most perimeter invading pests without having to spray and in most applications made for carpenter bees, it can be all you need for the short term.\nNBS Repellent:  http://www.bugspraycart.com/exempt/additive/nbs-paint-additive-16-oz\nThank you for this page.  I have had Carpenter Bees for many years in my house roof\u2026\u2026.I was told to spray the wood with wasp spray. When the Bee eats into the wood it wood make it so nasty that they would leave.   I like what you say about the bees and how to get rid of them\u2026I\u2019m 60 years old and my husband died last year and now I have to try and kill these things by myself.  I will be buying all I need from you soon. Thank you so much for the advice\u2026the duster may just be the ticket for me.\nOnce again, thank you.\nYou are welcome. I believe you can tackle this problem the right way with the right products so hopefully you can reach all the holes and get the job done this time so they don\u2019t keep coming around. The real key is getting their holes dusted with Drione so make sure you can access as many of them as possible.\nDrione:  http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/dust/drione-dust\nI bought some Drione about 10 years ago to treat carpenter bees in my previous house.  It seemed to work well.  We now have a carpenter bee problem in a large wooden arbor at our current house.  I have some of the Drione left.  Is it still good enough to use or does it lose it\u2019s effectiveness over time?  (It\u2019s been kept in it\u2019s original container with the cap screwed on.)  Thanks!\nWhen it comes to liquids, I generally say anything over 5 years is probably loosing potency. But rodent bait, lawn granules and dust (like Drione) can remain stable a lot longer. That being said, my guess is your Drione has lost some (if not most) of it\u2019s Pyrethrin and Piperonyl Butoxide. So now the question is will this matter? Maybe not.\nIf the dust has been kept mostly free of moisture, it could still work. In my experience, Drione will begin to change color over time becoming more grey, tan or brown with age. Along the way it may begin to clump up too. Both of these changes are directly related to moisture being absorbed and if too much moisture gets into the dust, it won\u2019t work.\nSo for now, I\u2019d at least inspect the dust to see what color it appears to be. If it\u2019s still \u201cclose to white\u201d and not a dark grey or brown, you should able to use it. I say that because even with a significant loss of pyrethrin it can do the job. And that\u2019s because it\u2019s main mode of action is to work as a dessicant which it can still do as long as it hasn\u2019t already been exposed to too much moisture.\nBut if it looks to be bad or if you apply some to a hole and find the bees aren\u2019t dying within a few minutes, I\u2019d say it\u2019s time for a fresh jar!\nDrione:  http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/dust/drione-dust\nThe carpenter bees I want to eliminate are mostly inside a large fenced area where all my dogs roam.  Is the treatment harmful to pets?\nNo, the treatments will not be harmful to your pets, people or the environment. In fact, if you follow our directions, there would be no exposure to them anyway. Let me explain. \nAs our article details, the dust goes in the bee holes \u2013 not out in the open. And the Cypermethrin is to be sprayed over the surfaces where the bees like to drill. Since it sounds like this would be a fence, people and pets would barely come in contact with the treated surfaces. But even if they did, it wouldn\u2019t matter.\nYou see, Cypermethrin is actually labeled for use on plants and turf which means it\u2019s okay to walk over treated surfaces. This means even if they did come in contact with it, nothing would happen.\nHere are links to these items in our cart.

They can be seen on every product page as well as here:\nSafety Videos:  http://www.bugspray.com/video/safety-videos.html\nI noticed that you or someone was using cork to plug the holes. Can you use caulking to fill in the holes ?\nDefinitely NO! This can lead to all kinds of problems as explained here:\nhttp://www.carpenterbees.com/seal/sealing-carpenter-bee-holes-with-caulking.html\nMy home is 90% brick but is an older home with trim and eves of cedar. After treating and plugging all the holes the carpenter bees have made, would aluminum or vinyl siding be an option to install over the cedar?  And would this help eliminate the bee problem all together?\nNo doubt covering the cedar with aluminum or vinyl siding is an option. But based on our experience, this would be a bad idea. Here\u2019s why.\nHomes which are targeted by carpenter bees have this happen because there is a special scent being released by some part of the home. This is usually certain wood components like trim, soffits or facia boards. And once the wood has nests, there will now be the added lure of female bees, their nest sites and other pheromones that will no doubt attract more carpenter bees. And even after you treat the holes with Drione and seal them with Corks, the smells will linger for many years to come.\nNow in cases where we\u2019ve seen people try to prevent new nests from being drilled, what we find is that the bees will merely crawl through small cracks and crevices in the siding that are barely detectable but none the less present. These seams are there for good reason; to allow the siding to expand and contract. So the siding is not an effective, air tight \u201cshell\u201d as some would have you to believe. And once the bees starts entering access points, it becomes even tougher to treat and control the problem because their nests will be hidden and covered up. So in the end, covering the exposed wood is not suggested. So what\u2019s the best way to stop carpenter bees from drilling new nests?\nSimple. No doubt the best way to deal with this problem is to dust with Drione and seal the holes with Corks. Next, spray with Cypermethrin. And if you ever paint or stain the wood, add some NBS additive to the mix which will provide much longer lasting residual action compared to the Cypermethrin alone. Though this may seem like it\u2019s a never ending process, in fact it\u2019s quite effective and will keep them at bay. Unfortunately it\u2019s not a permanent solution but it will work at stopping future damage and for now, the most practical solution.\nDrione:  http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/dust/drione-dust\nCorks:  http://www.bugspraycart.com/equipment/equipment-plugs/cork-12\nCypermethrin: http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/liquid/viper-cypermethrin\nNBS Repellent:  http://www.bugspraycart.com/exempt/additive/nbs-paint-additive-16-oz\nMy husband was under the impression that carpenter bees would not bother with pressure treated wood.  Is this not correct?\nIt\u2019s definitely not correct. Unlike most pests, carpenter bees aren\u2019t eating the wood so the harsh chemicals of the pressure treated lumber won\u2019t affect them. And I\u2019ve seen that after 1-2 years, pressure treated lumber will loose a lot of it\u2019s density and become vulnerable. And though a good coat of paint can help prevent carpenter bees from drilling, even that\u2019s not a sure thing.\nJust view the video above, at the start of this article, and you\u2019ll see a carpenter bee that was drilling through my Duration painted railing. Mind you Sherwin Williams Duration paint is thick and strong but this female bee wanted in and nothing was stopping her. And the same can happen with any pressure treated lumber. \nSo in summary, pressure treated lumber is no doubt less likely to get drilled out by a carpenter bee but it\u2019s not entirely safe unless it\u2019s treated with one of the repellents we have listed above like the Cypermethrin or NBS.\nCypermethrin: http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/liquid/viper-cypermethrin\nNBS Repellent:  http://www.bugspraycart.com/exempt/additive/nbs-paint-additive-16-oz\nI dusted for carpenter bees with drione dust (great stuff, and the dust stick also works great), and within 2 \u2013 5 minutes 2 to 3 bees fell out and died. I then plugged the hole with a cork. Now the next day I see another carpenter bee flying around the holes I plugged. Should I then as a follow up spray with cypermethrin? I am assuming that this bee will not just give up and go somewhere else.\nAlso, thank you for your very informative videos, help when I called, and your thorough knowledge about carpenter bees. Thanks.\nDefinitely spray with Cypermethrin. This will both prevent any new holes from being drilled as well as chase off any other unwanted bee activity like you describe since the Cypermethrin is highly repellent to these guys.\nCypermethrin: http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/liquid/viper-cypermethrin\nNow one thing you might try the next time you treat any nests is to leave the hole open one day. This way any bees that were away from the nest when you treated will have a chance to enter, pick up the Drione and die. Leaving the holes open one day won\u2019t affect the treatment and if you seal them after 24 hours, the treatment will be equally as effective.\nDrione:  http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/dust/drione-dust\n@admin: Is it true that brown paint will attract carpenter bees?  Thank you.\nNo. There is no data to suggest that any specific paint color will attract or repel carpenter bees. That being said, if one adds some NBS Paint Additive to any color paint, they will no doubt see the bees stay away from that painted wood for a year or longer. \nSo in summary, even though we have been able to see data that suggests any color paint can be made highly repellent to carpenter bees, we\u2019ve not seen where any certain color or \u201clure\u201d can be added to paint that will attract them.\nHere are links to these items in our cart.

Every morning they are flying around the tree.    If we spray them directly will it kill them and what kind of product can we use?  They are not out in the afternoon and evening.   Thank you.\nIf you review our article above, you\u2019ll see the PT-515 is the fast killing aerosol product that can be used if you only have a few to knock out.\nPT-515: http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/aerosol/pt-515-wasp-freeze-18-oz\nYou\u2019ll also read in our article that carpenter bees will generally drill holes for nests and if you have any nests on the tree, you\u2019ll need to treat them with Drione Dust to make sure the problem doesn\u2019t persist.\nDrione:  http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/dust/drione-dust\nHand Duster: http://www.bugspraycart.com/equipment/dusters/crusader\nLastly, if you find more bees coming around drilling holes and building nests on the tree, spray it down with Cypermethrin to keep them away.\nCypermethrin: http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/liquid/viper-cypermethrin\nHi, we have had a noise in our attic and thought it was mice but have not caught any.  The noise was becoming louder and louder and in the same place above our bedroom.  When I tapped the ceiling in our bedroom, it was very soft like I could probably put a stick through it and I heard a buzz and then silence.  My husband went in the attic and removed some insulation and some bees started coming out.  We have siding on the entire house and just had a new roof installed 1 1/2 ago.  How could they have gotten in our attic and what can we do to get rid of them?  I don\u2019t want them to go through the ceiling in my bedroom!\nBees and wasps can gain access to voids and spaces in any home quite easily. There are so many way\u2019s \u201cin\u201d the list of possibilities would be quite long. Facia boards around gutters is one of the more common entry points but any attic vent, soffit vent, seams around chimneys and asphalt roofing as well as getting up under the siding can all be routes that eventually enable them to nest somewhere inside the home.\nNow for your current situation, the best way to treat would be from your bedroom \u201cup\u201d. And what I mean by up is through the ceiling where you sense the nest is located. To treat, you should first drill tiny holes through the sheetrock. These holes only need be large enough to fit the straw that comes with Dforce Aerosol which is about 7/64th of an inch wide. So if you drill a series of holes using a 1/8th inch drill bit and space them out in a checkerboard pattern over the spot where you sense the nest to be located, you\u2019ll then be able to inject the Dforce directly through the holes with no risk to you during the treatment. The other advantage is that you get to treat the nest while still inside your living space which is always an advantageous position to be.\nTo insure you get adequate coverage, drill out a 3 foot square area with the drill holes spaced 6 inches apart from one another. That means you\u2019ll have 7 rows of holes with each row containing 7 holes so the total amount of holes required will be 49. I know this sounds like it\u2019s a lot of holes but since drilling these small holes will only take a second, they can be made in a minute or two.\nNext you\u2019ll inject the Dforce into each hole holding the nozzle down for 3 seconds per hole. This will insure you get adequate coverage for the area which in turn will kill all the bees. The big advantage of treating the nest this way is that you\u2019ll avoid any contact with the bees since they\u2019re too big to fit through the holes you drilled and therefore will not be a threat. Additionally, once you\u2019re done treating, you should see instant results meaning the nest should be shut down within an hour of being treated. \nNow if you still hear activity the following day, it will mean you didn\u2019t use enough Dforce or the nest was a bit larger than the area you treated which means you should then try to expand the coverage and treat some more. But in most every case I\u2019ve handled this way, a 3 foot square area usually does the trick the first time. Good luck!\nD-Force:  http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/aerosol/d-force-14-oz-aerosol\nThank you for your informative web site and videos. After having read and watched it I definitely want to buy the drione and cypermethrin from you. My situation is that I have carpenter bees in an old stump in my back yard \u2013 right next to where I decided to build a grape arbor. I have this instinct to get a stump grinder and obliterate it. I suppose I\u2019d minimize the opposition by treating with the drione first, grind out the stump and then spray the remaining area with cypermethrin.\nAny thoughts?\nBest regards,\nRick W.\nI believe you\u2019re right on track with what you\u2019re thinking. Personally I\u2019d dust all the holes, cracks, crevices and any other place I could find on the stump with the Drione before I started grinding.\nDrione:  http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/dust/drione-dust\nHand Duster: http://www.bugspraycart.com/equipment/dusters/crusader\nNext, I\u2019d let it sit for at least one day. This would insure the Drione had a chance to impact as many pests as possible. \nI\u2019d then proceed by treating with a mixture of Cypermethrin. Expect to use 1/2 to 1 gallon of mixed material depending on how large the stump is. And let it soak in during the application. I also recommend treating the ground around it, say an area 20 ft by 20 ft, so that anything which attempted to crawl away during the grinding would be impacted by the Cypermethrin. Expect to use 1-2 gallons to treat the ground. Once this is treatment is done and allowed to sit for a day, I\u2019d go ahead and begin the grinding and removal of the stump.\nCypermethrin: http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/liquid/viper-cypermethrin\nThese are but one of the buzzing, flying, stinging insects \u201cplaguing\u201d us. It is unpleasant to be out in our yard to work, play or chill. They often pick places around our only entrance, exists and seating area. The carpenter bees (shiny bodies and all) have bored not only into wood settings but under our cement stoop and in the ground. \nNone of your article deals with those not building in wood but I assure, these have the shiny bodies and all. Also, they sometimes appear in my bathtub already dead (very odd!).  Is there anything different I need to do to safely get rid of this problem \u2014 now and \u201cfor good\u201d? My biggest concern right now \u2014 pertaining to these type specifically \u2014 are the ones in the ground that I fear have a big nest that has weekend the ground. Concerned someone \u2014 likely postman, landscaper or someone mowing \u2014 will put their foot and leg through the ground and right into their nest.\nNo doubt carpenter bees can nest in the ground. They\u2019ve been known to burrow into the root systems of trees and bushes which can lead them several feet down so what you\u2019re describing can and will happen. They\u2019ve also been known to find buried wood piles and other cellulose in which to nest. Remember, the decaying wood is what attracts them and wood in the ground is easy for them to \u201csmell\u201d and target.\nThe good news is treatment is both the same and usually pretty easy. So if you\u2019re able to see their entrance/exit holes, dust them with Drione. This will provide instant control of any adults currently active. Be sure to leave the treated hole open for a day and then after 24-48 hours, cap it with a rock or stick. This will enable the Drione to last a bit longer compared to leaving the hole open.\nDrione:  http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/dust/drione-dust\nHand Duster: http://www.bugspraycart.com/equipment/dusters/crusader\nNow if you\u2019re unsure where the entrance and exit holes are located, just spray over the ground where you see them with Cypermethrin. And if you effectively \u201cblanket\u201d the area, it will usually get them too. Just keep in mind the spraying is not nearly as fast acting and could take a week or two (along with 2-3 sprayings) to get the desired result.\nCypermethrin: http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/liquid/viper-cypermethrin\nPlease show your support for our business by purchasing the items we recommend from the links provided.

Every year we have a problem with the carpenter bees boring into the cedar siding and insecticides are only a temporary solution.  We are considering having the cedar treated with RhinoShield, but I would like your professional opinion regarding this before we make a decision.\nThank you,\nChuck A.\nDryden, MI\nWe\u2019ve not seen problems resolved when this and similar products are used to deter or repel insect pests like carpenter bees. The best analogy is to compare the RhinoShield to would be something like vinyl or aluminum siding.\nNow as you know, vinyl and aluminum siding are solids. Over the years of dealing with pests like carpenter bees, carpenter ants, wasps, etc., we\u2019ve had many customers report they installed vinyl or aluminum siding with the main goal being to stop invasive insects. In most all cases, they report failure. So how can this be? Are the bees drilling through the solid exterior? No. \nBasically what happens is that the pests simply avoid the material and instead, focus on gaps and joints where they\u2019re able to enter and nest. Granted the damage to the exterior siding will usually stop following these exterior treatments and coverings, but the nesting will still happen and with the nesting, an ongoing bee problem that really must be treated properly if a real solution is to be achieved.\nThis happens for two reasons. The first is because (as our article above explains), bees that leave a nest tend to come back to the same area to nest and start new nests. Kind of like salmon. So only when you kill these bees and make the area unlivable for them will you stop them from returning.\nThe other reason is related to the \u201csmell\u201d of your home. Mind you this is not something people can smell. But bees looking to nest are attracted to areas which contain the smells of decaying cellulose (wood) and the scents left behind from old established nests. So regardless of what kind of finish you put on your home, these smells will still linger and in turn, attract more carpenter bees.\nSo are we saying the RhinoShield is a bad product? No. In fact it does provide an exterior finish that can last a good 10 years or more. And this protection is overall good for most any homes exterior. But you should not invest in this product with the sole expectation that the bees will go away. In fact, what you should expect that they\u2019ll both linger and in the end, be more difficult to treat if you install RhinoShield over an existing problem like you\u2019ve described.\nI say this because once the home is treated with RhinoShield, the bees will be forced to utilize nothing but the gaps, cracks and crevices of the exterior. This will make identifying nests a lot more difficult and even if they are found, harder to treat.\nSo does this mean you shouldn\u2019t get RhinoShield? I would answer no; getting RhinoShield should still be considered. Just don\u2019t get it installed until after you resolve the current infestation using the Drione Dust listed above.\nHaving dealt with carpenter bees for over 30 years, I can state vehemently that when used properly, Drione will immediately kill any bees using a nest and render the nest useless so it cannot be reused in the future. Furthermore, if all the cracks, joints and gaps of the homes siding are dusted with Drione, bees and other pests will not be able to utilize these areas for nesting.\nAnd with that being stated, it should come as no surprise that what I suggest you do is to first dust all the holes and then all of the homes siding with Drione. Use a Hand Duster or Dustick to make the treatment and once this treatment has been done, let it sit for a day or two before sealing all the nest holes with Corks.\nNow after the holes are sealed, spray the homes exterior with either Cypermethrin or NBS to keep new bees away. I\u2019m certain that if you follow this suggestion precisely, you\u2019ll get positive results and within 1-2 weeks, you will barely see a bee hanging around any old holes or looking to start a new nests.\nNow after you see achieve these results, you should still consider getting the RhinoShield installed. No doubt having it applied after the bee problem is fixed is the way to proceed and if I was to speculate, I\u2019d say the combination of properly treating the existing holes combined with the RhinoShield, you should be able to get the best long term results and ultimately, a bee free exterior to your home.\nHere are links to these items in our cart.

We have a carpenter bee problem in our daughter\u2019s wood swing set. We definitely want to get rid of this pest but are concerned about the toxicity of pesticides. What treatment and products would you recommend that are safe for use around a play structure and kids?\nAll of the products we have listed for treating nests and the surrounding area will not pose a hazard to children, adults or pets. When done properly, the Drione will be contained in the tunnels and once the tunnels are corked, there will be no way for anyone to come in contact with the material.\nAs for the spray; the Cypermethrin is diluted at the rate of just 1 oz per gallon of water and once dilute, poses no hazard to people or pets. Now you do need to keep the kids away when you treat but once the treatments dry (which will take 1 hour or less), everyone can come back and go about their normal routine without undue risk or hazard. More information about how to handle, mix and apply our products can be read on line here:\nProduct Safety: http://www.bugspray.com/about-us/who_is_bugspray.html#safe_for_the_home\nNow if you\u2019re still uncomfortable spraying the Cypermethrin, you can opt to apply NBS instead. It\u2019s organic, won\u2019t kill insects but still has good \u201cbee repellency\u201d action which will help prevent new nests from being drilled.\n\nHere are links to these items in our cart. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Please show your support for our business by purchasing the items we recommend from the links provided.

I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s what they are. They are big fat bees that make a loud buzzing noise and have black rear ends but are yellow with a black spot on their backs. I sprayed in there once but 2 days later I saw them again. So I sprayed the inside with with an expanding foam to try and seal it up. I can\u2019t \u201ccork\u201d holes in a stone fence and there are too many potential entrances between the rocks to do so anyway. It has now been 6 days and everyday I still see bees trying to find a way in. They\u2019re not too happy but boy are they persistent. Any advice? I want to grout all the holes but this may not be easy with bees buzzing around me.\nOkay, I see that you said above that carpenter bees can burrow into ground nests and get into root systems\u2026. This makes sense because I had a birch tree die in the ground area behind the retaining wall a year ago. It was removed but the roots are still in there (Birch borers killed the tree). So now there is dead decaying roots in the ground there for sure. I have a new fringe tree (small) growing nearby there too. So first, I\u2019m worried the insecticide will get into the ground and kill my new tree. Secondly, I have to get this under control and then seal every crack in the rock retaining wall. So I still need advice but just wanted to add that. Thanks.\nFirst, stop sealing the entry ways the bees are using. This will only force them to move in and out of other areas and in turn, make treating more difficult. Anytime you can see activity and you know the pathways they\u2019re using, you should never seal it up. In fact, it would be wise to remove any of the foam you applied right away. This will allow the bees direct access and once you treat it as explained below, make the application that much more effective. But if you force the bees to create new entrance/exit ways, things might get a bit complicated.\nSecond, most any insecticide we\u2019d recommend will not hurt trees. In fact, many of our products we recommend are actually used on trees and shrubs to help save them from insects. You see, insecticides only work on insects. For trees, shrubs, plants, etc., it\u2019s herbicides that can kill them \u2013 not insecticides.\nThat being said, if you\u2019ve been spraying some kind of wasp bee freeze into these gaps, you could definitely hurt any plant that received a direct blast of the aerosol. This is because aerosols have all kinds of solvents and harsh additives that should not be used in the ground.\nBut what would be ideal is Drione Dust. It will easily penetrate deep into the voids and reach any hidden nests and because it\u2019s a dust, it won\u2019t get absorbed into the ground like a liquid. Apply it with a good Hand Duster and you\u2019ll see instant results. \nAnd after you treat, don\u2019t seal any of the gaps. Instead, leave them open indefinitely. Yes, over time the Drione will break down and loose it\u2019s effectiveness but I expect a properly done treatment will last 2-3 months at least. And if any bees or other pests start coming around again, you\u2019ll only have to dust some more and any insect pest will be quickly controlled and eradicated.\nDrione:  http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/dust/drione-dust\nCentro 14 oz: http://www.bugspraycart.com/equipment/dusters/centrobulb-14-oz-w12-ext\nGive us a call if you still have questions or concerns.

Thanks for your business!\nWe have an all brick home except the cedar front porch. Last year we noticed what we thought was honey bees at the end of the porch away from the door. Spraying wasp spray into the crack they were gong in and out of seemed to get rid of them.   Within the last two weeks we have so many bees at the other end of the porch, that we cannot use the door anymore. These bees do not look like the pictures of carpenter bees, nor can we find a hole that they created. These bees seem to be smaller and don\u2019t appear shiny. They do however go in and out of cracks were beams connect. We have sprayed and caulked to close where they were going in and out of (didn\u2019t read your advice prior to doing that). Can this be another type of bee and should we still use the Dione?\nWhat you\u2019re describing sounds like bumble bees. They look a lot like carpenter bees but are smaller and have \u201chair\u201d over their entire body. Bumble bees will have nests containing 25-50 members and though they typically nest in the ground, they will readily take up residence overhead in any small void they find.\nBumblebee Control:  http://www.bugspray.com/articles99/bumblebees.html\nNow as you already know, randomly caulking is a mistake and should not be done. Hopefully there are still plenty of access points available and from the bee activity you\u2019re reporting, it sounds like this is the case. I suggest you study the activity to see just where they\u2019re entering/exiting and once you locate these spots, treat with Drione. The great thing about the Drione is that it will penetrate the space through and through so they won\u2019t be able to avoid the dust. And since Drione works quickly, you will know within a day or two if you got them.\nNow if you see activity 2 days later after the initial dusting, simply watch to see where they\u2019re entering and retreat those spots. Its not uncommon to miss getting the entire nest the first time you treat so this can happen. But if you keep at it, you should be able to get them with one or more extra applications. Oh, and be sure to treat after dark to insure as many as possible are in the nest when you treat. This will enable you to get the best overall results.\n\nHere are links to these items in our cart. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Please show your support for our business by purchasing the items we recommend from the links provided.

After reading your very helpful site, I now know that the spray and foam that I used will not work permanently. I am guessing that Drione will exterminate the live bees and remain for the larvae, but how can I seal the 4\u2033 diameter end of the drain pipe? Thank you for a very informative website.\nFirst, remove as much as possible of the foam you\u2019ve applied. Next, make sure the area is allowed to sit \u201copen\u201d for at least a day before using the Drione. The more \u201cdry\u201d the area the better. \nNext, dust the pipe, around the pipe and any gaps you see in the rocks surrounding the pipe with the Drione. This will provide instant results and in theory, take care of any that are active as well as hatching larvae.\nA day later cap off the pipe with some mosquito screening. Simply fit a piece over the pipe and then keep it in place using a rubber band. The screen will allow water to exit the pipe but prevent insects (like bees) from entering. And if it ever gets clogged, just remove it, clean out the mesh and replace.

It sits in our carport. We are moving this week and I\u2019d like it move it inside our new house. It has numerous carpenter bee holes. Am I basically inviting a carpenter bee infestation inside our new house? Since it is late August, can we assume there are still eggs or larvae inside the holes or have they already hatched? My husband wants to bring it in and just kill the bees if they emerge. What do you think of that? Thank you for your help!\nSince the holes are open, it would be wise to assume there are developing eggs and/or pupae. That means at some point there will be adults hatching from pupae casings. And as our article above explains, one nest will typically have 3-6 developing young so there is a good chance of having several bees emerging from the cabinet (multiply the number of holes you see by 5 and this would be a good estimate).\nSo if you\u2019d like to keep the cabinet inside, it would be wise to treat the holes and be done with it. The good news is this would be easy to do. Basically all you\u2019d need is a can of PT-230 Drione (which can treat 5-10 holes) or the 1 lb Jar of Drione (if you have more than 10 holes visible). Simply dust the holes and cork them with 1/2\u2033 corks and the problem will be solved; there will be no chance of any bees emerging in the future.\nAlternatively, you can bring the cabinet inside and hope your estimate is way more than what actually emerges. With any luck, there won\u2019t be human/bee conflict as this will reduce the risk of people getting stung.\nHere are links to the items you\u2019d need to treat the problem and be done with it (choose either the PT-230 or the 1 lb Drione based on how many holes you see).\nPT Tri-Die: http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/aerosol/pt-230-tri-die-8-oz\nDrione:  http://www.bugspraycart.com/insecticide/dust/drione-dust\nHand Duster: http://www.bugspraycart.com/equipment/dusters/crusader\nCorks:  http://www.bugspraycart.com/equipment/equipment-plugs/cork-12\n\n\nClick here to cancel reply.\nName (*)\n\nEmail (*)\n\nURL\n\nFields marked by an asterisk (*) are required.\n\n\nNotify me of followup comments via e-mail\n\n\nWordpress Hashcash needs javascript to work, but your browser has javascript disabled.

There are several species of carpenter bees in the United States. One of the most common species is Xylocopa virginica (L). This is probably also the most destructive carpenter bee. Its range extends from Kansas to Texas and eastward to the Atlantic.\nCarpenter bees are fairly large, 12.5 to 25 mm in length. They resemble bumblebees, except that their abdomen is smooth and mostly hairless. Male carpenter bees are very territorial, but they have no stinger. Females have a potent stinger, but seldom sting.\nFemale carpenter bees make holes in wood in order to deposit their eggs. They make their galleries in almost any wooden object they find. They attack decks, siding, landscape timbers and even lawn furniture. They seem to prefer unpainted and unstained wood, but they will also attack painted or stained wood.\nThe female carpenter bee makes a hole in the wood about the same size as her body. The female bores a hole to a depth of 25 mm, makes a right angle turn, and burrows along the grain of the wood. Galleries may extended 10 to 15 cm. Older galleries that have been reused may extend up to 3 meters long. The sawdust and wood shavings on the ground are often a clue that carpenter bees are active.\nThe female carpenter bee puts some pollen and other food in the gallery and then deposits an egg. She seals the compartment with chewed wood pulp and then repeats the process. When she has finished, the gallery will have several compartments with an egg in each one. Depending on the species and the climate, the eggs develop into adult bees in 36 to 99 days.\nCarpenter bees are not social insects. Each female lays her own eggs. However, several females may attack the same piece of wood. In many cases, they even share a gallery. Over time, carpenter bees can cause significant damage.\n\n\t\tGive us a call:\n        \n844-514-3980\n\n\nOr schedule a call with an Orkin Specialist today and get a FREE estimate for:\n\n\t\tThis branch appears close by:\n\t\t\n\n,  \n\n\nNot in ?\n\t\tEnter a zip code below to view local branches.\n\u00a0"], ["Carpenter Bee: pictures, information, classification and more", "http://www.everythingabout.net/articles/biology/animals/arthropods/insects/bees/carpenter_bee/", "Carpenter bees resemble bumble bees but do not have yellow markings. The females of most species are black or blue with a metallic sheen and may be up to 2.5 cm (1 in) long. In general, the males look like the females. In some species, the males are covered by light brown, light green, or yellowish-green hairs. Carpenter bees typically fly long distances and visit many kinds of flowers. They can maintain their body temperature when the air is cool. Several species form colonies that display interesting social behaviors. Some of these species pass through several stages of social development as the colony matures.\nWhen female carpenter bees construct tunnels in solid wood, their chewing of the wood can be heard from several feet away. Piles of sawdust beside the nest entrance and the presence of many bees in flight in the area provide clues that a nest is near. Brood cells (compartments for offspring) are constructed in the tunnels. The cells are separated by partitions made from sawdust or wood chips cemented together with saliva.\n\nPhoto by:Alastair Shay/Oxford Scientific Films\nThe females of the Virginia carpenter bee produce one generation each year, but individuals may live two years.

Females are entirely black. The males are black with whitish markings on the face, and they have gray fur on the thorax. Males and females are both larger than bumble bees. The species is mainly active at dawn and dusk during the summer and can be seen cruising around nectar-producing flowers, such as honeysuckles. The males chase each other and may fight.

The only species of importance found in Missouri is Xylocopa virginica (L.), a large species also known from Florida north to Connecticut, and west to Illinois, Kansas and Texas. They are similar in size and appearance to bumble bees (Bombus spp.), but with the top surface of the abdomen being black, almost entirely hairless, and shiny (Figure 1). Males have a white face, whereas the female's face is black.\nCarpenter bees are often seen hovering near decks, eaves, and gables of homes. Homeowners may become alarmed by this activity because male carpenter bees patrol these areas and will fly near people. They defend territories and may be aggressive, but they are unable to sting, so their aggression is just a show. Female carpenter bees do not actively defend nesting sites and are usually not aggressive, but females can sting if they are handled.\n Figure 1Adult carpenter bees resemble bumble bees with shiny, black, hairless abdomens.\u00a0\n Figure 2Female carpenter bees tunnel and lay eggs in wood.\u00a0\nCarpenter bees are normally considered to be beneficial insects since they pollinate a wide variety of plant species. However, when making tunnels in the wood of human structures, they are considered to be economic pests. The openings to these tunnels are a near-perfect circle measuring approximately 1/2 inch in diameter. The tunnel goes straight into the wood for a few inches before making a 90-degree turn and following the length of the wood (Figure 2). It is not unusual for several tunnels to extend out from a single opening.\nFemale carpenter bees construct individual cells within each tunnel. Each cell contains one egg and enough food for a developing larva. To make the food, she collects pollen and mixes it with plant nectar to form a substance called bee bread. She places the food into the tunnel, lays a single egg on it, and builds a partition in the tunnel with cemented wood chips. She continues this process until 6 to 10 cells are constructed.\nThe lifetime of a carpenter bee, from egg to death, covers one year. New adult bees emerge briefly in August or September, feed and re-enter their galleries to pass the winter. In the spring those bees that survive winter emerge again in April, mate, and produce a new generation. They reuse existing tunnels or build new ones in which to lay their eggs. These adult bees die in July, following mating and egg-laying. Carpenter bee activity begins again when their offspring have matured and emerge briefly during September. Infestations may persist for several generations over several years, with each generation lasting a full year.\nPeople may become alarmed when holes begin to appear in exposed wood. Unsightly defecation stains may also be present near the openings to carpenter bee tunnels. While carpenter bees attack many species of dried, seasoned wood, they seem to prefer softwoods such as pine, fir, redwood and cedar. They may damage porch and shed ceilings, railings, overhead trim, wooden porch furniture, dead tree limbs, fence posts, wooden shingles, wooden siding, windowsills and wooden doors. They prefer unpainted or well-weathered wood to painted or hardwood timbers. Preferred nesting sites are usually at least 2 inches thick.\nManagement of carpenter bee populations consists of treating each individual tunnel opening with insecticide. Tunnel openings should be treated after dark when the bees are calm and in the nest \u2014 preferably on cool nights. Use a pressurized can of bee/wasp spray that shoots a stream of liquid into the tunnel and immobilizes the bees. Many products are formulated to spray in a stream. Cotton soaked in a liquid insecticide and placed into the gallery is also effective. Be sure to wear rubber gloves when choosing this method. You can also place a longer lasting insecticide, such as a dust, wettable powder, or microencapsulated insecticide formulation inside the galleries. Dusts usually work best. Dust is most easily placed in the gallery opening using a hand duster. A flexible bottle with a nozzle makes an acceptable hand duster. Fill the bottle no more than one-third full, insert the tip in the entrance hole, and inject the dust by alternately squeezing and releasing the pressure on the bottle.\nWithin a few days after treatment, tunnels can be filled with caulking compound, plastic wood or a tight-fitting (1/2-inch) wooden dowel glued in place. If paint on the wooden surface is not undesirable, painting will discourage further attack by other carpenter bees.\nConsider treating tunnel openings in the early spring before bee activity begins. Spring treatment is best and most effective before mating and egg-laying activity begins. When you treat tunnel openings before activity begins, wait until the bees have become active for a few days before you fill the tunnels.\nIf mating, tunneling, and egg-laying activities have already begun in the spring, you will need to treat the tunnel openings at least twice. The first treatments occur during the spring activity period. These treatments eliminate the adults that are mating and building new nesting sites, but may not affect the eggs and larvae that are already developing inside the brood chambers. A second treatment can be made to the tunnel openings during the late summer activity period to ensure that adults that emerged from these larvae are also eliminated. Tunnels can be sealed after this second treatment.\nWhen carpenter bees are discovered during the brief activity period of late summer and early fall, a single treatment can be applied to tunnel openings with good results. Treating tunnel openings during this period can be effective because only one generation of bees is present. Wait 24 to 48 hours after treatment before filling tunnels to ensure that adult bees have had time to be exposed to treated areas. If activity continues, you may reapply dust a second time before filling the holes.\nG7424, revised August 2007\nAbout | Jobs | Extension councils | \r\nFor faculty and staff | Giving | Ask an expert | Contact\n\u00a9 1993\r\n  to 2014 Curators of the University\r\n  of Missouri, all rights reserved, DMCA\r\n  and   other copyright information\nPublished\r\nby University of Missouri Extension, guidelines to\r\nreprint or copy\r\nUniversity of Missouri Extension is an equal opportunity/ADA institution.\n\nUniversity of Missouri Extension\n\u00a9 1993\r\nto 2014 Curators of the University of Missouri, all rights reserved"], ["Carpenter Bees - Buzz About Bees", "http://www.buzzaboutbees.net/carpenter-bees.html", "Carpenter bees belong to the bee family \u2018Apidae\u2019, although they were \noriginally classified with the family \u2018Anthophoridae\u2019. (You can read \nmore about the families of the different types of bees  \nhere\n). They also belong to the genus Xylocopa, and to the insect order\n\u2018Hymenoptera\u2019.  \n\nNot\n surprisingly, these bees get their name because they are known to make \ntheir nests by boring holes in wood.  \nThey then use small amounts of \nwood chips to form partitions between the cells in which they lay their \neggs.  Small amounts of sawdust may be visible around nest sites, \nalthough old nest tunnels may be used.\nAlthough they are solitary, with some species, females may live \nalongside their own sisters or daughters, thus forming a basic social \ngroup.\n\n\nThis particular species pictured left is Xylocopa violacea, is \ngenerally found in southern Europe, although it has recently been \ndiscovered in the UK.\u00a0 I have read that this species lays the largest \negg of any insect!\n \nI took the photograph above whilst on holiday in \nItaly. \nI had seen several of them foraging among the flowers (they\u2019re \ngood pollinators), and was eventually lucky enough to see one whilst I \nhad my camera with me.  \n\nLike other species, they will sting only if provoked, and are mostly interested in foraging and going about their business.  \n(Learn more about bee stings and treatments here). \nMales cannot sting.\u00a0 However, they are territorial, and it can come as a\n bit of a surprise if they seemingly fly at you!\u00a0 They seem to be attracted to you the more you waft your arms around.  \nHowever, they cannot \nharm you in any way.  The females are able to sting, but like bumblebees\n they are docile, and will rarely do so.\n\nThey emerge from hibernation in the \nspring, around April or May.  They overwinter as adults in wood within \nabandoned nest tunnels.\nBy late spring or early summer, you may see them \nhovering around  searching for mates and suitable nesting sites.  After \nmating, the fertilized females excavate tunnels in wood.   \nAs with some other\n solitary bees, the female constructs the nest alone.  She lays her eggs\n within a series of small cells, each supplied with a ball of pollen on \nwhich the larvae feed.  The larvae emerge as adults in late summer, and \nhibernate until the following year.\n\nSome\n people are keen to get rid of these bees if they discover they have\n them, however, these types of bees do not always cause significant \ndamage, although some species may cause damage.  \nCarpenter bees \nare more inclined to make their nests in rotting old or damaged wood.   \nThis can lead people to believe it is the bees themselves who have \ncaused the damage, but very often it will be a sign that the wood needs \nto be replaced in any case.\nHowever, they may also target soft wood.\u00a0 If concerned, it is better to check carefully and take steps if necessary (see my advice to a reader below).Bees are \nexcellent pollinators\nof flowers and plants.  It is better \nto engage in preventative carpenter bee control, rather than using \npesticides or trying to kill carpenter bees.\u00a0 Always maintain woodwork, keep it\n well painted and in good condition.  These bees are not out to make \nwork for themselves by selecting hard, painted wood that will be more \ndifficult for them to bore into. \n\n\nI received an email message via my contact form, asking the following question.\u00a0 I thought I would share it, because certain carpenter bees are often mistaken for bumblebees, and I felt the advice and insight might be interesting for other visitors.\u00a0 Thank you to Lisa for allowing me to publish her query:\nFrom Lisa, USA:\"I am fascinated by what my husband calls a worker bumble \nbee. \nEvery spring when the bees come out to play, a bumblebee hangs out \nby my deck. \nI swear he comes when I call. He guards the deck from any \nother insect including other bumble bees. He chases them away. \nI will \noften go to the door and say \"hello bee\" and he will come to the door \nand hover as if listening to me. I know that all this is coincidence, \nbut I like to think he can hear me. \nAs soon as anyone goes on the deck, \nits like he is hanging out with us, keeping guard. \nI love having him, \nbut what is he actually doing? Right now I have not put any plants out \nand he is already here for a couple of days. Thank you\".\n\nMy response to the query above was as follows:\n\"Dear Lisa\nFrom the behaviour you\ndescribe, it sounds like you have carpenter bees rather than bumblebees.\u00a0\nSome carpenter bees do indeed look like bumblebees, in that they are quite\n\u2018roundish\u2019 in appearance.\u00a0 Males bees are very protective of the\nnest, chasing off insects, and investigating human \u2018trespassers\u2019!\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIndeed, in a sense, when you call \u2018hello bee\u2019 from your door, he is indeed\n\u2018hearing you\u2019 \u2013 by that, I mean that he is probably picking up the vibrations and\ninvestigating the intrusion accordingly, to see if there is a threat to the\nnest.\u00a0 So in fact, there is no coincidence here, and you are not imagining\nthings, and yes he is seeminlgy \u2018hanging out\u2019 with you and \u2018keeping guard\u2019 to ensure you\ndon\u2019t harm the nest.\u00a0 \nHowever, all this is bravado\non his part.\u00a0 Male carpenter bees (just like other male bees) cannot\nsting.\u00a0 They are completely harmless.\nAnother alternative is that\nyou have a male carpenter bee prospecting for a mate, having found an ideal nest site.\u00a0\nAnyone/anything is chased off, until a potential sweetheart arrives on the\nscene!\u00a0 \n\n\nBumblebees do not (as far as I am aware) exhibit\nthis kind of behaviour in defending nests.\u00a0 Worker females (all workers are female) do defend\nthe nest, but from inside it.\u00a0 For this reason, dead bees may sometimes be\nfound outside a bumblebee nest entrance, following a conflict within the nest\n(followed by some tidying up and clearing out!).\nFor your information, some\ncarpenter bee species can, over time, cause some damage to woodwork.\u00a0 If\nthe woodwork is crucial, I suggest you keep it painted and well maintained to\ndeter them, because they prefer soft and old, untreated wood.\u00a0 Try to\nlocate the nest if you believe you have one, and examine it to see if it is\ncausing damage (it is the females that do the burrowing and nest\nbuilding).\u00a0 If there is damage, but the wood is not important, then it is\nnothing to worry about \u2013 or you may wish to relocate the piece of wood if you\ncan, a little further from the house at the end of the year, if you are\nconcerned.\n\u00a0\nHere is a brochure you may\nlike - it has information about several bee types, including carpenter\nbees.\nI hope this helps.\"\n\nIf you have a similar situation, I recommend the following steps to locate the nest and/or protect structures, such as the timber structures of a home:\n1. Are\nthere any areas that could be soft or rotten or unpainted?\u00a0 These are the\npreferred areas where carpenter bees prefer to nest, so I would check these first.\u00a0\n 2.

The thorax of the carpenter bee (directly \r\nbehind the head) is usually covered with yellow, orange, or white hairs.\nCarpenter bees rank \r\namong the largest of bees native to the United States. There are numerous \r\nspecies of carpenter bees (Xylocopa) that inhabit a diverse range of \r\nhabitats from tropical to subtropical to temperate. In the United States, \r\ncarpenter bees occur across the southern United States from Florida to Arizona \r\nand in the eastern United States, north to New York.\nAs pollinators, \r\ncarpenter bees are generalists in our gardens and landscapes\u2014they may be found \r\nforaging on a number of different species. Like their close cousins, the \r\nbumblebees, carpenter bees are early morning foragers. Carpenter bees are \r\nexcellent pollinators of eggplant, tomato and other vegetables and many types of \r\nflowers.\nCarpenter bees have very \r\npowerful thoracic muscles\u2014when carpenter bees land on flower blossoms they \r\nbecome living tuning forks and can \u201csonicate\u201d the dry pollen grains out of the \r\nflowers\u2019 anthers. This type of pollen collection in known as \"buzz pollination.\" \r\nCarpenter bees are reported as being excellent pollinators of many vegetables \r\nand flowers. Carpenter bees are even mass produced in the Philippines for \r\nfarm-pollination services.\nOn occasion, carpenter \r\nbees can be quite ingenious in their foraging for nectar. Because of their large \r\nsize, carpenter bees are not capable of entering long, tubular flowers such as \r\nthose produced by salvias and penstemons. Instead they become nectar robbers. \r\nUsing their mouthparts they cut a slit at the base of corolla and steal away \r\nwith the nectar without having pollinated the flower. We have also noticed this \r\nto the case for flowers of yellowbells (Tecoma stans, also known as \r\nyellow elder and trumpetbush).\nThere are a number of \r\nnatives species of the carpenter bee in the U.

Only the female carpenter bee is capable of \r\nstinging, but rarely does so unless handled or severely agitated.\nUnlike the bumble bee \r\nthat typically builds colonies in the ground, the carpenter bee is a solitary \r\nbee preferring to live and nest alone in wood tunnels. Carpenter bees do not \r\nconsume wood, but their tunneling can be destructive to softwoods and hardwoods \r\nalike. Under normal conditions they are not very destructive; however, if \r\nseveral generations of carpenter bees have been tunneling in the same area, \r\nextensive damage is possible.\nWeathered woods are a \r\ncommon target of carpenter bees; thus, they are often found tunneling into fence \r\nposts, lawn furniture, the roof and eaves of buildings, decks, window shutters, \r\nwood shingles and siding. \nTo deter this behavior, \r\nkeep exposed wood surfaces, including nail holes and saw cuts, coated with \r\npolyurethane or oil-base paint. Consider using non-wood building materials, such \r\nas vinyl siding, to avoid possible damage by carpenter bees.

After mating, usually in April or May, a female excavates a tunnel in wood or cleans out and reuses an old one. The nesting holes are perfectly round and about the diameter of a finger. Often, a pile of sawdust is found near the entrance of a tunnel and one may hear scraping sounds indoors. Males and females are territorial and will defend nest sites and potential mates. The female lays her eggs in a series of small cells within the tunnel. Each cell is provisioned with a small ball of pollen on which a single larva feeds. The larva pupates in the cell and emerges as an adult in late summer. The new adults leave the nesting holes to feed on nectar, but return to the tunnels to over-winter.\nDamage: Damage from a single nest is minor; however, structural damage to wood that has been used for nesting for several years may be considerable. Sawdust that is produced as a tunnel is excavated often contains insect waste and may leave unsightly stains. Woodpeckers seeking the immature larvae inside the nest may cause further structural damage.\nBenefits: Carpenter bees play an important role in the pollination of wild flowers and agricultural crops.\n\nSting: Female carpenter bees only sting when disturbed; however, their sting can be painful. If you are stung, cooling the area with ice may be soothing. Males, identified by their yellow face, are aggressive and will often dart toward people near a nest. There is no need to be alarmed, males do not have stingers and cannot sting you. \nRemember! Insect stings can elicit a life-threatening, allergic reaction in some individuals. Check with your physician to determine what symptoms require a visit to the emergency room. Never attempt any control measure if you have a known allergy to insect stings.\nFurther sources: Hutchins, R.E. and R. Cuffari. 1972.

The common name of \"bullhorn\" refers to the enlarged, hollowed-out, swollen thorns (technically called stipular spines) that occur in pairs at the base of leaves, and resemble the horns of a steer. In Yucat\u00e1n (one region where the bullhorn acacia thrives) it is called \"sub\u00edn\", in Panam\u00e1 the locals call them \"cachito\" (little horn). The tree grows to a height of 10 metres (33\u00a0ft).\n\n\nBullhorn Acacia is best known for its symbiotic relationship with a species of Pseudomyrmex ant (Pseudomyrmex ferruginea) that lives in its hollowed-out thorns. Unlike other acacias, Bullhorn acacias are deficient in the bitter alkaloids usually located in the leaves that defend against ravaging insects and animals. Bullhorn acacia ants fulfil that role.\nThe ants act as a defense mechanism for the tree, protecting it against harmful insects, animals or humans that may come into contact with it. The ants live in the hollowed-out thorns for which the tree is named. In return, the tree supplies the ants with protein-lipid nodules called Beltian bodies from its leaflet tips and carbohydrate-rich nectar from glands on its leaf stalk. These Beltian bodies have no known function other than to provide food for the symbiotic ants. The aggressive ants release an alarm pheromone and rush out of their thorn \"barracks\" in great numbers.\nAccording to Daniel Janzen, livestock can apparently smell the pheromone and avoid these acacias day and night.[2] Getting stung in the mouth and tongue is an effective deterrent to browsing on the tender foliage. In addition to protecting V. conigera from leaf-cutting ants and other unwanted herbivores, the ants also clear away invasive seedlings around the base of the tree that might overgrow it and block out vital sunlight.\nThe thorns of V. cornigera, are often strung into unusual necklaces and belts. In El Salvador the horn-shaped thorns provide the legs for small ballerina seed dolls which are worn as decorative pins."], ["Pseudomyrmex ferruginea - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudomyrmex_ferruginea", "The acacia ant (Pseudomyrmex ferruginea) is a species of ant of the genus Pseudomyrmex. These arboreal, wasp-like ants have an orange-brown body around 3\u00a0mm in length and very large eyes. The acacia ant is best known and named for living in symbiosis with the Bull's-horn Acacia (Acacia cornigera) throughout Central America.[2] The ant and the acacia exemplify a coevolution of a mutualistic system, as described by evolutionary ecologist Daniel Janzen.[3]\n\n\nP. ferruginea is an obligate plant ant that occupies at least five species of acacia (A. chiapensis, A.\u00a0collinsii, A.\u00a0cornigera, A.\u00a0hindsii and A.\u00a0sphaerocephalia). Its life cycle conforms to the claustral pattern of ants in general. [4]\nTo repel herbivorous animals, various acacias protect their succulent leaves with one of several methods, including vicious-looking spines, repellent, noxious chemicals, and \u2014as in the case of the bull's horn acacia\u2014 by developing a mutualism with the Acacia ant.[2]\nThe symbiotic relationship begins when a newly mated queen gets attracted by the odour from the tree and starts nesting inside the large hollow acacia thorns. The queen nibbles into the thorn to lay 15-20 eggs to produce the first generation of workers. As the colony grows, more of the bulbous thorns get inhabited, and when the colony reaches some 400 individuals the ants start to act as gardeners.[2]\nAs gardeners, the ants aggressively attack creatures of all sizes attracted by the acacia leaves, killing insects such as crickets and stinging the heads of mammals such as goats.[2] Even other plants such as epiphytic vines are repelled[5] and as little as an unfamiliar odour can cause the ants to swarm toward the potential threat. Additionally, the ants scout the ground around the tree for seedlings and destroy any competitors they find. In compensation, special glands at the base of the tree's leaves produce a nectar rich in sugar and amino acids, and the tips of the leaves sprout Beltian bodies, small nutritious packets of oils and proteins. However, not all is mutually beneficial: the ants relish the sweet honeydew produced by scale insects which suck the sap of the acacia and therefore protect them as well, effectively providing entry to diseases.[2]\nThe development of myrmecophytism (\"ant symbiosis\") and spininess in African and New World acacia species was an adaptation to the presence of large faunas of effective browsing mammals. The ants' sting is very painful, causing a lasting burning and throbbing effect. The ants provide vital protection to the bull's-horn acacias day and night, and it has been shown[6] that without the ants, Acacia cornigera suffer greater damage from attacking insects and tend to be overgrown by competing plant species.[4]\nNuptial flight occurs in warm weather at any time of the year. If an acacia thorn has not been opened by a previous occupant, the queen gnaws a circular hole to enter the thorn cavity. She lays 15 to 20 eggs, rears her first brood while remaining secluded inside the thorn. The population of the colony then increases to 150 workers within seven months, to 300 three months later, to 1,100 in two years, and to over 4,000 in three years.[4]\nIn young colonies workers leave the protective thorns to collect nectar and Beltian bodies, but only as long as necessary. At rare intervals they leave their thorns to occupy new ones. Males and virgin queens are produced during the second year. As the number of ants reach 50-100, workers start patrolling the open plant surface next to their home thorn, and as the population reaches 200-400 workers become more aggressive and attack other smaller nearby colonies, ward off phytophagous insects that make landing attempts near the thorn more effectively.\nIn old colonies the queen is physogastric (i.e. a swollen, membranous abdomen), heavily attended by workers, and accompanied by hundreds of eggs and young larvae.[4]\nThe larvae are fed on unaltered fragments of Beltian bodies that are pushed deep into the larva's food pouch (the trophothylax, a pocket just behind the mouth). The larva then starts to rotate its head in and out of the pouch to chew the contents, while ejecting droplets of clear fluid possibly containing digestive enzyme into the pouch.\nFragments that protrude from the pouch are removed by a worker and redistributed. Regularly, workers force open the pouch to regurgitate droplets of fluid into it. The nature of this fluid is uncertain. It is possible captured insects constitute a secondary source of nutrition to the larvae.[4]"], ["Relationship provides nutrients, housing, protection: bull ...", "http://www.asknature.org/strategy/a8f1de052537e7a1a21d8f4644aec4a5", "\u00a0\u00a0\nLoading...\nBull horn acacia and ants have a mutualistic relationship with many facets: a. large thorns provide nesting for ants, b.

Unlike the Central American swollen-thorn acacias that are protected by symbiotic ants, this species produces alkaloids to discourage hungry herbivores; therefore, it doesn't depend on stinging ants to defend itself.  Because it produces alkaloids it also grows more slowly than the ant-protected acacias, and must grow in drier habitats where the competing vegetation also grows more slowly.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhistling Thorn Acacia Of South Africa\nThe whistling thorn of Kenya (Acacia drepanolobium) has bulbous thorns occupied by stinging ants of the genus Crematogaster.  Like the Central American acacias, the ants hollow out the soft green thorns for living quarters.  Giraffes and other herbivores normally eat thorny acacia foliage, but leave the whistling thorn alone.  In fact, for most South African acacias, spines alone are no deterrent to giraffes.  They simply reach high into the branches and carefully wrap their long prehensile tongue around the tender foliage, carefully avoiding the vicious spines.  At the San Diego Zoo you can watch a giraffe delicately removing tender leaves from the winter thorn (A. albida) near the edge of its enclosure on Horn and Hoof Mesa.  Their feeding actually produces the characteristic flat-topped shapes of many acacias on the vast African savannahs.  In the case of the whistling thorn acacia, a mouthful of stinging ants is an excellent deterrent to hungry herbivores.  Old thorns which have been vacated by the ants make a whistling sound as wind blows across the entrance hole.\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\nLarge, inflated thorns of the whistling-thorn acacia (Acacia drepanolobium), an African swollen-thorn acacia.  In the wild, the thorns are occupied by symbiotic stinging ants of the genus Crematogaster that protect the tree from destructive herbivores.  The bulbous thorns are not galls and will develop with or without their symbiotic ants partners.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhistling Thorn Symbiosis May Be One-Sided:\n\r\n\r\nAdditional complexities about Africa's whistling thorn (Acacia drepanolobium) are discussed in a recent article by Maureen Stanton and Truman Young in Natural History Volume 108 (November 1999).  Studies by Stanton and Young reveal that four species of stinging ants live symbiotically on A. drepanolobium: Crematogaster mimosae, C. nigriceps, C. sjostedti, and Tetraponera penzigi.  Their studies also reveal that the symbiotic relationship between some of these ant species and their host acacia may not be equally beneficial to both partners.  Since these different species of ants are rival enemies, they occupy separate trees.  If acacia branches containing rival ant colonies make contact, the different species of ants will fight each other, with the loser being evicted from its tree.  Unlike the Central American thorn acacias that provide their ant warriors with protein-lipid Beltian bodies on leaflet tips, the whistling thorn provides no such service.  This forces the ants to leave the tree to forage for insects and other protein-rich foods which they bring back to the developing ant larvae living inside the swollen thorns.  According to Stanton and Young, refuse pushed out of the thorn nests may help to fertilize the tree.   \r\n\r\nThe relationship between some of these ant species and their acacia is not completely mutualistic because it may harm the acacia tree.  Crematogaster mimosae and C. sjostedti both tend scale insects that feed on the tree's vascular system, milking the aphid-like insects for their nutritive honeydew secretions.  In fact, C. sjostedti pays little attention to herbivores that attempt to feed on the tree.  The latter species also nests in hollow spaces within dead and dying branches, rather than in the swollen thorns.  Colonies even thrive in the stumps of dead trees.  To make matters worse, this species of ant often comes out the winner in battles with other ant species over the possession of a tree.  According to Stanton and Young, the balance in a once mutualistic relationship has shifted in favor of one partner (the ant) at the expense of the other (the tree).\r\n\r\nAlthough not as extreme as Crematogaster sjostedti, the relationship between C. nigriceps and its acacia host is also one-sided in favor of the ant.  This ant species chews off the tips of growing shoots, including leaf and flower buds, thus pruning and sterilizing the tree.  New branches are allowed to grow mainly in the proximity of swollen thorns, thus ensuring nectar-rich petiolar nectaries (glands) on new leaves easily accessible to worker ants inside the thorns.  Over time, this pruning by ants changes the growth rate and shape of the tree canopy, compared with trees occupied by other ant species.  In addition, pruning is more radical on sides adjacent to rival ant trees, thus reducing the chance of contact with branches of rival trees containing more aggressive ant species. \r\n\r\n\n\n\nCecropia Trees & Their Symbiotic Ants\nThere are other trees in the Central American rain forest with symbiotic ants.  Some of the most interesting are species of Cecropia of the mulberry family (Moraceae), including C. peltata and C. obtusifolia.  Cecropia trees are easily recognized by their large, peltate, palmately lobed leaves which are clustered at the ends of relatively few, candelabra-like branches.  In Costa Rica, the reason three-toed sloths are often found in cecropia trees is that they are easier to spot in the open, leafless branches compared with other trees.  The pithy limbs and stem internodes are usually hollow and occupied by colonies of Azteca ants, a neotropical genus of aggressive, biting ants.  The ants commonly feed on the nutritious \"honeydew\" secretions of mealy bugs, but will also forage for other insect prey.  According to D. H. Janzen (Costa Rican Natural History, 1983), during the dry season in the Guanacaste Province of Costa Rica, leafless cecropia trees maintain a crop of tiny leaves bearing minute food bodies for the colonies of Azteca ants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo To The Article About Acacia Trees\nReturn To The Article About Alkaloids\nGo To WAYNE'S WORD Home Page\nGo To\r\nNOTEWORTHY PLANTS Page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\nAn acacia ant (Pseudomyrmex ferruginea)  sipping nectar from the petiolar nectary of a swollen thorn acacia (Acacia collinsii) in Costa Rica.

Because it produces alkaloids it also grows more slowly than the ant-protected acacias, and must grow in drier habitats where the competing vegetation also grows more slowly.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhistling Thorn Acacia Of South Africa\nThe whistling thorn of Kenya (Acacia drepanolobium) has bulbous thorns occupied by stinging ants of the genus Crematogaster.  Like the Central American acacias, the ants hollow out the soft green thorns for living quarters.  Giraffes and other herbivores normally eat thorny acacia foliage, but leave the whistling thorn alone.  In fact, for most South African acacias, spines alone are no deterrent to giraffes.  They simply reach high into the branches and carefully wrap their long prehensile tongue around the tender foliage, carefully avoiding the vicious spines.  At the San Diego Zoo you can watch a giraffe delicately removing tender leaves from the winter thorn (A. albida) near the edge of its enclosure on Horn and Hoof Mesa.  Their feeding actually produces the characteristic flat-topped shapes of many acacias on the vast African savannahs.  In the case of the whistling thorn acacia, a mouthful of stinging ants is an excellent deterrent to hungry herbivores.  Old thorns which have been vacated by the ants make a whistling sound as wind blows across the entrance hole.\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\nLarge, inflated thorns of the whistling-thorn acacia (Acacia drepanolobium), an African swollen-thorn acacia.  In the wild, the thorns are occupied by symbiotic stinging ants of the genus Crematogaster that protect the tree from destructive herbivores.  The bulbous thorns are not galls and will develop with or without their symbiotic ants partners.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhistling Thorn Symbiosis May Be One-Sided:\n\r\n\r\nAdditional complexities about Africa's whistling thorn (Acacia drepanolobium) are discussed in a recent article by Maureen Stanton and Truman Young in Natural History Volume 108 (November 1999).  Studies by Stanton and Young reveal that four species of stinging ants live symbiotically on A. drepanolobium: Crematogaster mimosae, C. nigriceps, C. sjostedti, and Tetraponera penzigi.  Their studies also reveal that the symbiotic relationship between some of these ant species and their host acacia may not be equally beneficial to both partners.  Since these different species of ants are rival enemies, they occupy separate trees.  If acacia branches containing rival ant colonies make contact, the different species of ants will fight each other, with the loser being evicted from its tree.  Unlike the Central American thorn acacias that provide their ant warriors with protein-lipid Beltian bodies on leaflet tips, the whistling thorn provides no such service.  This forces the ants to leave the tree to forage for insects and other protein-rich foods which they bring back to the developing ant larvae living inside the swollen thorns.  According to Stanton and Young, refuse pushed out of the thorn nests may help to fertilize the tree.   \r\n\r\nThe relationship between some of these ant species and their acacia is not completely mutualistic because it may harm the acacia tree.  Crematogaster mimosae and C. sjostedti both tend scale insects that feed on the tree's vascular system, milking the aphid-like insects for their nutritive honeydew secretions.  In fact, C. sjostedti pays little attention to herbivores that attempt to feed on the tree.  The latter species also nests in hollow spaces within dead and dying branches, rather than in the swollen thorns.  Colonies even thrive in the stumps of dead trees.  To make matters worse, this species of ant often comes out the winner in battles with other ant species over the possession of a tree.  According to Stanton and Young, the balance in a once mutualistic relationship has shifted in favor of one partner (the ant) at the expense of the other (the tree).\r\n\r\nAlthough not as extreme as Crematogaster sjostedti, the relationship between C. nigriceps and its acacia host is also one-sided in favor of the ant.  This ant species chews off the tips of growing shoots, including leaf and flower buds, thus pruning and sterilizing the tree.  New branches are allowed to grow mainly in the proximity of swollen thorns, thus ensuring nectar-rich petiolar nectaries (glands) on new leaves easily accessible to worker ants inside the thorns.  Over time, this pruning by ants changes the growth rate and shape of the tree canopy, compared with trees occupied by other ant species.  In addition, pruning is more radical on sides adjacent to rival ant trees, thus reducing the chance of contact with branches of rival trees containing more aggressive ant species. \r\n\r\n\n\n\nCecropia Trees & Their Symbiotic Ants\nThere are other trees in the Central American rain forest with symbiotic ants.  Some of the most interesting are species of Cecropia of the mulberry family (Moraceae), including C. peltata and C. obtusifolia.  Cecropia trees are easily recognized by their large, peltate, palmately lobed leaves which are clustered at the ends of relatively few, candelabra-like branches.  In Costa Rica, the reason three-toed sloths are often found in cecropia trees is that they are easier to spot in the open, leafless branches compared with other trees.  The pithy limbs and stem internodes are usually hollow and occupied by colonies of Azteca ants, a neotropical genus of aggressive, biting ants.  The ants commonly feed on the nutritious \"honeydew\" secretions of mealy bugs, but will also forage for other insect prey.  According to D. H. Janzen (Costa Rican Natural History, 1983), during the dry season in the Guanacaste Province of Costa Rica, leafless cecropia trees maintain a crop of tiny leaves bearing minute food bodies for the colonies of Azteca ants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo To The Article About Acacia Trees\nReturn To The Article About Alkaloids\nGo To WAYNE'S WORD Home Page\nGo To\r\nNOTEWORTHY PLANTS Page\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\nAn acacia ant (Pseudomyrmex ferruginea)  sipping nectar from the petiolar nectary of a swollen thorn acacia (Acacia collinsii) in Costa Rica.

Crematogaster mimosae and C. sjostedti both tend scale insects that feed on the tree's vascular system, milking the aphid-like insects for their nutritive honeydew secretions.  In fact, C. sjostedti pays little attention to herbivores that attempt to feed on the tree.  The latter species also nests in hollow spaces within dead and dying branches, rather than in the swollen thorns.  Colonies even thrive in the stumps of dead trees.  To make matters worse, this species of ant often comes out the winner in battles with other ant species over the possession of a tree.  According to Stanton and Young, the balance in a once mutualistic relationship has shifted in favor of one partner (the ant) at the expense of the other (the tree).\r\n\r\nAlthough not as extreme as Crematogaster sjostedti, the relationship between C. nigriceps and its acacia host is also one-sided in favor of the ant.  This ant species chews off the tips of growing shoots, including leaf and flower buds, thus pruning and sterilizing the tree.  New branches are allowed to grow mainly in the proximity of swollen thorns, thus ensuring nectar-rich petiolar nectaries (glands) on new leaves easily accessible to worker ants inside the thorns.  Over time, this pruning by ants changes the growth rate and shape of the tree canopy, compared with trees occupied by other ant species.  In addition, pruning is more radical on sides adjacent to rival ant trees, thus reducing the chance of contact with branches of rival trees containing more aggressive ant species. \r\n\r\n\n\n\nCecropia Trees & Their Symbiotic Ants\nThere are other trees in the Central American rain forest with symbiotic ants.  Some of the most interesting are species of Cecropia of the mulberry family (Moraceae), including C. peltata and C. obtusifolia.  Cecropia trees are easily recognized by their large, peltate, palmately lobed leaves which are clustered at the ends of relatively few, candelabra-like branches.  In Costa Rica, the reason three-toed sloths are often found in cecropia trees is that they are easier to spot in the open, leafless branches compared with other trees.  The pithy limbs and stem internodes are usually hollow and occupied by colonies of Azteca ants, a neotropical genus of aggressive, biting ants.  The ants commonly feed on the nutritious \"honeydew\" secretions of mealy bugs, but will also forage for other insect prey.  According to D. H. Janzen (Costa Rican Natural History, 1983), during the dry season in the Guanacaste Province of Costa Rica, leafless cecropia trees maintain a crop of tiny leaves bearing minute food bodies for the colonies of Azteca ants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo To The Article About Acacia Trees\nReturn To The Article About Alkaloids\nGo To WAYNE'S WORD Home Page\nGo To\r\nNOTEWORTHY PLANTS Page\n\n\nThe whistling thorn of Kenya (Acacia drepanolobium) has bulbous thorns occupied by stinging ants of the genus Crematogaster.  Like the Central American acacias, the ants hollow out the soft green thorns for living quarters.  Giraffes and other herbivores normally eat thorny acacia foliage, but leave the whistling thorn alone.  In fact, for most South African acacias, spines alone are no deterrent to giraffes.  They simply reach high into the branches and carefully wrap their long prehensile tongue around the tender foliage, carefully avoiding the vicious spines.  At the San Diego Zoo you can watch a giraffe delicately removing tender leaves from the winter thorn (A. albida) near the edge of its enclosure on Horn and Hoof Mesa.  Their feeding actually produces the characteristic flat-topped shapes of many acacias on the vast African savannahs.  In the case of the whistling thorn acacia, a mouthful of stinging ants is an excellent deterrent to hungry herbivores.  Old thorns which have been vacated by the ants make a whistling sound as wind blows across the entrance hole.\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\nLarge, inflated thorns of the whistling-thorn acacia (Acacia drepanolobium), an African swollen-thorn acacia.  In the wild, the thorns are occupied by symbiotic stinging ants of the genus Crematogaster that protect the tree from destructive herbivores.  The bulbous thorns are not galls and will develop with or without their symbiotic ants partners.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhistling Thorn Symbiosis May Be One-Sided:\n\r\n\r\nAdditional complexities about Africa's whistling thorn (Acacia drepanolobium) are discussed in a recent article by Maureen Stanton and Truman Young in Natural History Volume 108 (November 1999).  Studies by Stanton and Young reveal that four species of stinging ants live symbiotically on A. drepanolobium: Crematogaster mimosae, C. nigriceps, C. sjostedti, and Tetraponera penzigi.  Their studies also reveal that the symbiotic relationship between some of these ant species and their host acacia may not be equally beneficial to both partners.  Since these different species of ants are rival enemies, they occupy separate trees.  If acacia branches containing rival ant colonies make contact, the different species of ants will fight each other, with the loser being evicted from its tree.  Unlike the Central American thorn acacias that provide their ant warriors with protein-lipid Beltian bodies on leaflet tips, the whistling thorn provides no such service.  This forces the ants to leave the tree to forage for insects and other protein-rich foods which they bring back to the developing ant larvae living inside the swollen thorns.

The thorns are grouped in pairs at the base of the leaves and are connected at the base and pointed in opposite directions resembling the horns of a bull. Besides being extremely sharp which suggests one being careful when touching this plant these thorns are also feared for another reason. As it matures and becomes an adult, the mated acacia queen ant, Pseudomyrmex ferruginea, looks for these thorns and digs a hole at the base of the thorns. Its goal its to reach the hollow center of the thorns base where it will lay its eggs. After being born the young worker ants get out of their thorny nest and patrol the stem and young leaves nearby everyday. These stinging ants hunt down any insect that dares to eat the bullhorn acacia young fresh leaves. In fact, these ants are so aggressive that they attack any animal or even humans that touches or harms the tree. When bullhorn acacia is wounded it releases chemicals into the air as an alarm signal that the ants detect and respond to rapidly. The ants release an alarm pheromone whenever a threat is detected and rush out of their thorn \"barracks\" in great numbers. Scientists think that livestock and other foraging animals can apparently smell the pheromone and avoid these acacias. In this way the ants serve bullhorn acacia interests in keeping its leaves intact. As the queen ant continues to lay eggs at the base of each pair of thorns the colony grows and spreads to neighbouring branches. On doing this it is quite common that two different colonies of this ant species meet on the same tree. Then war begins. It is really a bloody war that can last for quite sometime and usually the biggest colony wins. The ant colonies are not just fighting for their thorny nests they also fight for the food that tree provides. The bullhorn acacia does not leave its valuable and tiny fearless guests with empty hands. The antes are in fact quite well rewarded by the plant. The bullhorn acacia provides two types of food. First, it has well located extraforal nectaries at the lower part of base of its leaves. These nectaries exude continuously sweet nectar, derived from phloem sap, all year round. Second, the bullhorn acacia supplies solid food in the form of protein-lipid nodules called Beltian bodies from its leaflet tips. These perfectly distinguishable orange nodules have no known function other than to provide food for the symbiotic ants and their larvae. In fact both species are so well adapted to each other that ant larvae have a special pouch, on the lower side of their bodies bellow the head, in which the worker ants put pieces of the Beltian bodies for the larvae to eat and store.\nThe protective nature of the ants towards the bullhorn acacia is not only against any harmful insect that threatens to eat the bullhorn acacia young and fresh leaves. The ants seem to do much more for the benefit of the host tree and not on their own interest. The ants also target any plant that stands in the bullhorn acacia way. The acacia ants travel along the tree base, trunk and main branches regularly, and they destroy any plant seedling within a radius of 30 cm from the acacia trunk keeping the acacia free or nearby competitors for water and nutrients from the soil. The ants are also aware of any plant that may come through air. Whenever a branch of a neighbouring plant touches the bullhorn acacia the ants pass to that neighbour plant and destroy the invading branch apex so it can no longer grows. It is hard to measure what benefits the most from this symbiotic and mutualistic relationship between the acacia ants and the bullhorn acacia. The main benefit that the tree gets is that it is free from insects that would damage its leaves and suck its sap. This enormous advantage was demonstrated by removing all the thorns and ant nests of the bullhorn acacia. Being thornless and without ants the bullhorn acacia showed itself vulnerable and life threatened when compared with a normally protected tree. One factor that may account for this disadvantage, when made thornless and without its protective ants, is that bullhorn acacias are deficient in the bitter alkaloids usually located in their leaves that defend them against ravaging insects and animals. Acacia ants, Pseudomyrmex ferruginea, also establish similar symbiotic relationships with tow other Central American acacia species, Acacia sphaerocephala and Vachellia collinsii, all collectively known as bullhorn acacias together with Acacia cornigera. It has also been observed that a single ant colony can spread over several bullhorn acacias. In Africa, a similar mutualism occurs between the Whistling Thorn acacia, Acacia drepanolobium, and ants from the species Crematogaster mimosae.\n\u00a0Last updated on September 6, 2012\nYou can help the HubPages community highlight top quality content by ranking this article up or down.\nNo comments yet.\nSign in or sign up and post using a HubPages account.\nNo HTML is allowed in comments, but URLs will be hyperlinked.

The acacias provide the ants with food, in the form of protein, fat and sugar secreted for their delectation by special organs called Beltian bodies, and also with homes, in the hollow thorns which give the plant its name. The ants reciprocate by stinging anything\u2014from other insects to cattle\u2014that dares try to eat the acacia\u2019s leaves. The latest research, though, suggests that the ants do more than just drive away herbivores. They also act as a sort of immune system which protects acacias from infection.\nThis discovery, reported in New Phytologist by Marcia Gonzalez-Teuber of La Serena University, in Chile, dates back to an observation made a decade ago that macaranga trees, which have similar symbiotic relations with ants, seem immune to a particular fungus when ants are present, but not when they aren\u2019t. Dr Gonzalez-Teuber wondered if something like this was true of acacias\u2014and if it was, why.\n\nTo try to find out she chose ten wild acacia plants in the state of Oaxaca, in Mexico, and evicted the ants from one branch of each by plucking them off, removing the thorns, and stopping them returning by coating the base of the branch with a sticky substance that traps insects. As a control she sliced the thorns off a second branch, but left the ants free to roam over it.\nAfter six weeks, she found that 45% of the leaves on the experimental branches showed signs of infection, compared with 14% of those (including the thornless controls) over which ants could roam freely. And when she tried culturing micro-organisms from leaves taken from the various branches she showed that those from branches without ants were more heavily infected with known plant pathogens.\nThe reason, she discovered, was on the ants\u2019 legs. When she and her colleagues amputated some of these, washed them in methanol to see what they could extract, and applied the result to colonies of micro-organisms cultured from acacia leaves, they found that the extract eradicated many of those colonies. When they analysed the extract they discovered it contained several types of bacteria known to synthesise antibiotics. The ants, then, by acting as hosts to these bacteria, are protecting their own hosts from the attentions of other micro-organisms\u2014and making the legend of their mutual relationship with acacias grow yet further in the telling.\n\nFrom the print edition: Science and technology \nJan 25th 2014\nJan 18th 2014\nJan 11th 2014\nJan 4th 2014\n\n\n\nLife is getting tougher for foreign companies.

(Nick) - Ant Blog", "http://www.antweb.org/antblog/2012/04/do-bullhorn-acacia-ants-sting-nick.html", "Hello,\nI have been interested in certain insects & also arachnids for many years.I happened to encounter your website today while doing a google search for images of velvet ant varieties.They have absolutely beautiful coloration so I was doing a search on those insects.I realize velvet ants are not ants & are wasps but nevertheless I thought your site was interesting.Is it true that Bull Horn acacia ants in South America have a very painful sting? Its not often insects have a mutual-beneficial relationship with plants & other insects though it does occur in a number of species.\nNick\n\nHi Nick,\nBullhorn acacia-ants have a sting rated as a 1.8 on the Schmidt Sting Pain Index. While not excruciatingly painful by itself, when these ants attack, they attack with the full force of the colony and will continue stinging for as long as they can. They are also incredibly aggressive and will launch themselves from their trees onto invaders with no regard for their own safety. The wisest course of action is usually to avoid these trees altogether. Once you come into contact with the ants it is easy to understand how they can so effectively protect their plants because they are so aggressive and unpleasant.\nThe mutualism between the acacia-ants and their host plants is rather unusual but similar behaviors have evolved convergently both within the acacia-ant genus (Pseudomyrmex) and in unrelated genera such as Crematogaster and Azteca. Mutualistic Crematogaster ants in Eastern Africa are even able to protect their acacia hosts from megaherbivores like elephants and giraffes.

The ants hollow out these horns\nand live in them. If any animal disturbs the tree, the ants will swarm\nout and sting the intruder. In addition to that, if other plants sprout\nnear the tree they will nip off the sprout so that no plant species\ncompetes with the bullhorn for nutrients or water. The ants take very\ngood care of this tree. \nThe tree has sugar\nproducing nectar glands and protein-rich growths on the tips of its\nleaflets. This secretion nourishes the ants, so the tree not only\nprovides a place for the ants to live, but feeds them as well. This\nfood would not be useful to most animals and insects, but it is perfect\nfor this particular species of ants. This is a classic example of\nsymbiosis in which the two unrelated life forms are so dependent upon\neach other that neither would survive for long without the other. \nConstructing a theory of how such relationships come about usually\ninvolves suggesting that the two forms were occasionally in contact\nwith each other, and gradually became dependent upon each other.\nSuggesting that the perfect food the bullhorn makes for the ant was\ndifferent in the past requires some unlikely major chemical\nmanipulation and is unsupported by fossil evidence. The behavior of the\nants that involves cutting off any plant that would compete with the\nbullhorn so it cannot grow makes assumptions about the ability of the\nant to develop a rather advanced concept of agriculture. We would\nsuggest that this as well as other symbiotic relationships that exist\nare a part of the design that we see in the world around us.

Ants chew these holes, enter the hollow thorns and live inside. A single ant colony\n    may span several A. collinsii trees. If a herbivore comes along and touches the tree, the\n    ants rush onto the animal and bite. Thus it's a mutualistic relationship, with both tree\n    and ant benefiting. \nThe tree not only provides handy shelters for the ants but also feeds them.

But being inhabited by aggressive insects could make one important aspect of a plant's life difficult - flowering. \nFlowers need to be pollinated so the plant can reproduce. So what stops the ants from attacking the helpful little pollinators or stealing all the tasty nectar that attracts them? \n\"Some plants do this structurally, with physical barriers to stop ants getting on to the flower, or sticky or slippery surfaces that the insects can't walk on,\" said Dr Raine. \n\"Acacias don't have these barriers. They have very open flowers, but still, the ants don't seem to go on to them. We wanted to know why.\" \nOne clever approach by the plant is a food \"bribe\". \"Extrafloral nectaries\" are small stores of nectar on stems, from which the inhabitants can feed without going on to the flowers. \nAcacias also produce structures called beltian bodies on the leaf tips. \nThese, Dr Raine explains, are nutritious structures produced by the plant to feed its resident colony of ant-guards. \nBut when this isn't enough, it is a case of chemical warfare. \nFlowers can produce a variety of chemicals. We can smell some of the volatile organic compounds they release when we sniff our favourite summer bloom. \nBut there is a more manipulative side to these scents. \nFloral volatile compounds can act as signals - drawing in pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds in with their irresistible aromas. \nTo the ants, however, they are far from irresistible. \n\"The flowers seem to produce chemicals that are repellent to the ants,\" said Dr Raine. \"They release these particularly during the time when they're producing lots of pollen, so the ants are kept off the flowers.\" \nIn recent studies, described in the journal Functional Ecology, Dr Raine and his colleagues found that the plants with the closest relationships with ants - those that provided homes for their miniature guard army - produced the chemicals that were most effective at keeping the ants at bay. \n\"And that was associated with the flower being open,\" he says. \"So the chemicals are probably in the pollen.\"\nWhen the pollen has all been taken away - by being brushed on to the bodies of hungry pollinators and helpfully delivered to other plants - the flowers become less repellent. \n\"So at this point, the ants can come on to the flowers and can protect them from other insects that might eat them, so that the developing seeds aren't lost,\" he explains. \nDr Raines' team was able to test this using young flowers that had just opened and that contained lots of pollen. \nThe scientists wiped them on older flowers and on the acacia's stems. \nThis showed them that the effect was \"transferrable\" - the stems and older flowers that had been wiped became more repellent. \n\"It gives this really neat feedback system - the plant is protected when it needs to be protected, but not when it doesn't.\" \nSelective deterrents\nThe repellent chemicals are specific to the ants. In fact, they attract and repel different groups of insects. \n\"[The chemicals] don't repel bees, even though they are quite closely related to ants. And in some cases, the chemicals actually seem to attract the bees,\" says Dr Raine. \nThe researchers think that some of the repellents that acacias produce are chemical \"mimics\" of signalling pheromones that the ants use to communicate. \n\"We put flowers into syringes and puffed the scent over the ant to see how they would respond, and they became quite agitated and aggressive\" he explained. \n\"The ants use a pheromone to signal danger; if they're being attacked by a bird they will release that chemical that will quickly tell the other ants to retreat.\" \nDr Raine says this clever evolutionary system shows how the ants and their plants have evolved to protect, control and manipulate each other. \nThe ants may be quick to swarm, bite and sting, but the harmless-looking acacias have remained one step ahead.\r\n\nWhat are these?\nPrint Sponsor\nMost Popular Now | 36,043 people are reading stories on the site right now.\";\n   Search term:   \nBBC \u00a9 2014 The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Deprived of this sugar\r\n            source the ants turn to another - they allow sap-sucking insects\r\n            such as aphids or scale insects to attach to the plant and then get\r\n            sugar exuding from the sap-suckers This ant-aphid symbiosis is\r\n            common in the ant world - many species of ants do this, and they\r\n            protect the aphids or scale insects from predators in return.\u00a0\r\n            Thus, the plant goes from having the ants as an ally to having the\r\n            ant as an enemy.\u00a0 Ironically, it was this type of ant that was\r\n            first co-opted by the acacias when they started producing nectaries\r\n            and thus inducing the ants to abandon their sap-sucking proxies and\r\n            go to work full-time for the tree.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nOur observations in Costa Rica\r\n            showed that the ants don't exclude all insects and other animals\r\n            from the Acacia.\u00a0 To the left, a spider is spinning its web\r\n            adjacent to an inhabited thorn.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis is a good reference on Acacias:\u00a0 http://waynesword.palomar.edu/plaug99.htm\n\nReferences:\n\nIn addition to the web\r\n            references listed above, these two books are excellent!\nH\u00f6lldobler B, Wilson EO.\u00a0 1990.\u00a0\r\n            The ants.\u00a0 Harvard University Press.\u00a0 732 pp.\nH\u00f6lldobler B, Wilson EO.\u00a0 1994.\u00a0\r\n            Journey to the ants.\u00a0 Harvard University Press.\u00a0 224 pp.\nJanzen, DH.

Raupp, Professor of Entomology at the University of Maryland.\nSpecialized green glands at the leaf's base produce nectar for ants, and orange Beltian bodies are a source of lipids and proteins for them.\u00a0\nWith today\u2019s episode, Bug of the Week continues its tropical adventure in Belize. In last week\u2019s feature we met leafcutter ants, fungus farmers of the rainforest. This week we explore the fascinating relationship between tropical myrmecophytes, plants that partner with ants, and the feisty ants which serve as their bodyguards.\nWhile walking along a dusty road, we encountered a brilliant green Acacia tree near a pasture. This remarkable tree was completely unmolested by any type of leaf-munching caterpillar, sucking insect, or large mammal such as the horses or cows that grazed nearby. A closer inspection revealed fearsome looking thorns arising from nodes of the branches. Surely these thorns, locally known as cockspurs or bullhorns, helped explain why large grazing mammals avoided the otherwise delectable looking leaves of the Acacia. A mouthful of thorns would be a painful experience indeed. However, as I fondled the foliage of the Acacia, I was instantly attacked by a furious band of ants that bit and stung my hand with extreme prejudice.Their sting was memorable and my swollen hand throbbed and itched for hours after the encounter.\nSmall holes in the thorn allow ants to enter and exit.\nThe secret weapon of the Acacia, ant bodyguards, is part of a symbiotic deal struck eons ago by acacias and ants in the genus Pseudomyrmex. The deal works like this: A newly mated Pseudomyrmex queen lands on the bullhorn acacia and locates a large thorn. Either by chewing a new hole or by using an existing one, she enters the hollow thorn and lays eggs. Eggs hatch and develop into sterile workers.\u00a0Workers, the queen, and subsequent broods subsist on carbohydrate laden nectar produced by specialized glands near the base of leaves. But ants, like people, cannot live by sugar alone. At their tips, leaves also produce specialized structures called Beltian bodies. These detachable tidbits are rich in nutrients such as proteins and lipids. By providing room and board, acacia plays the generous host for\u00a0Pseudomyrmex. In return, fearless worker ants provide maniacal protection of the acacia from caterpillars, sap-sucking insects, probably large herbivores, and, certainly, nosey entomologists. One additional benefit of the bodyguards is their role as vegetation managers. In addition to being devoid of leaf-eating insects, choking vines that ascended other nearby plants were notably missing from the acacia. In a clever series of studies, Dan Janzen demonstrated that not only do the ants protect acacias from herbivores, they also aggressively removed nearby plants that might compete with acacia for sunlight. All deals should be this good!\u00a0\n\nWe thank the fearless crew of BSCI 279M: Tropical Biology in Belize for providing the inspiration for this Bug of the Week.

Wilson and the fascinating articles \u201cInteraction of the bull's-horn acacia (Acacia cornigera\u00a0L.) with an ant inhabitant (Pseudomyrmex ferruginea\u00a0F.

While yellow flowers and many species demonstrate a loose form of the coevolution between generalized pollinators and a large range of plants, the coevolution in this case is very specific, although there are other examples of Acacias with ants that have a looser association.\nThe species depicted here are likely Acacia cornigera and Pseudomyrmex ferruginea, native to Mexico and Central America.  These photos were taken at Palo Verde National Park in Costa Rica.While some instances of coevolution may be hard to demonstrate for certain, this case is definitive.  First, a common name of this acacia species, bullhorn acacia, refers to the extremely large, swollen thorns shown here.  The horns also happen to be hollow, and provide perfect chambers for nesting ants.  (An ant on the left thorn can be seen entering a hole in it.) \nNext, the tree provides food for the ants in two forms. The first is nectar, but this is not the generalized nectar production of flowers attracting pollinators.  The acacia nectar is provided from extrafloral nectaries, found actually on the leaf petioles, as shown here (slightly out of focus).  Because of the location and size of these nectaries, it is clear that the trees are obtaining a benefit apart from pollination. \n\nSecond, the tree also produces a unique protein source for the ants called Beltian bodies (after the naturalist Thomas Belt).  These extraordinary structures are produced as part of new developing leaves.  When the new leaves unfold and expand, there is a Beltian body on the tip of each leaflet.  These are harvested by the acacia ants and provide most of their protein.  Between the nectar and the Beltian bodies, and the housing provided by the thorns, the tree provides all an ant colony\u2019s needs.\nWhat does the tree get in return?  It gets extremely aggressive defense from herbivores, both large and small.  Pseudomyrmex have one of the nastier stings in the world of Hymenoptera (the order comprising ants, bees and wasps).  Any insect that alights on the tree is instantly driven away or killed, and the ants are quite effective against potential vertebrate herbivores as well \u2014 to which I can attest first hand when I made the mistake of brushing against a branch while taking these pictures.  The ants are so aggressive that they also take care of potential plant competitors, by cutting down any seedlings that sprout in the vicinity of the tree.  In this photo it should be clear that the acacia in the center is sitting in a circle of bare dirt, courtesy of its ant colony.  \nThe relationship between the acacia tree and Pseudomyrmex ants is thus a true mutualism, in which both species have a large benefit from the association.\n\n\t\t<!--\n\t\t//OBSTART:do_NOT_remove_this_comment\n\t\tvar OutbrainPermaLink=\"http://bioblog.biotunes.org/bioblog/2007/10/02/cool-bug-9-acacia-ants/\";\n\t\tif(typeof(OB_Script)!='undefined'){OutbrainStart();} else {\n\t\tvar OB_PlugInVer=\"7.0.0.0_Regular\";;var OB_raterMode=\"none\";var OB_recMode=\"strip\";var OBITm=\"1313530810\";var OB_Script=true;var OB_langJS=\"http://widgets.outbrain.com/lang_en.js\";document.write(unescape(\"%3Cscript src='http://widgets.outbrain.com/OutbrainRater.js' type='text/javascript'%3E%3C/script%3E\"));}\n\t\t//OBEND:do_NOT_remove_this_comment\n\t\t//-->\n\t\t\n\n<!--\nwpa2a.script_load();\n//-->\n\n\n\n\nRelated Posts\nBookmark\nTags\n\n\nApril 7, 2009 -- Cool bugs #10 \u2013 Fruit fly parasitesJune 22, 2007 -- Cool Bugs #8 \u2013 Carnivorous Hawaiian caterpillarsApril 19, 2007 -- Cool Bugs #5 \u2013 BelostomatidaeMarch 24, 2007 -- Cool Bugs #3 \u2013 Fly wasp mimicsMarch 7, 2007 -- Cool Bugs #2 \u2013 Rhagoletis juglandisJuly 6, 2013 -- Cool Bugs #11:  Atta Girl, The GameJanuary 4, 2011 -- The \u201cscientific method\u201d still works, if we give it a chanceMay 12, 2010 -- When will sociologists learn some sociobiology?May 1, 2008 -- Insect JazzSeptember 16, 2007 -- One parrot a career makes\n\n\n           \n\n\n\ncool bugs evolution\n\n\n\n\n\nOne Response to \u201cCool Bugs #9 \u2013 Acacia ants\u201d\n\n\n\n\n Jacob Haqq-Misra says: \n\n\t\t\tOctober 3, 2007 at 7:19 pm \nFascinating!

Members of these genera are known simply as \"wasps\" in other English-speaking countries. Most of these are black and yellow; some are black and white like the bald-faced hornet, Dolichovespula maculata. Others may have the abdomen background color red instead of black. They can be identified by their distinctive markings, their occurrence only in colonies, and a characteristic, rapid, side to side flight pattern prior to landing. All females are capable of stinging. Despite having drawn the fear and loathing of humans, yellow jackets are in fact important predators of pest insects.[1]\n\n\nYellow jackets are sometimes mistakenly called \"bees\" (as in \"meat bees\"), given that they are similar in size and appearance and both sting, but yellow jackets are actually wasps. They may be confused with other wasps, such as hornets and paper wasps. Polistes dominula, a species of paper wasp, is very frequently misidentified as a yellow jacket. A typical yellow jacket worker is about 12\u00a0mm/0.5\u00a0in long, with alternating bands on the abdomen; the queen is larger, about 19\u00a0mm/0.75\u00a0in long (the different patterns on their abdomens help separate various species). Workers are sometimes confused with honey bees, especially when flying in and out of their nests. Yellow jackets, in contrast to honey bees, are not covered with tan-brown dense hair on their bodies, they do not carry pollen, and do not have the flattened hairy hind legs used to carry it.\nThese species have lance-like stingers with small barbs, and typically sting repeatedly,[1] though occasionally a stinger becomes lodged and pulls free of the wasp's body; the venom, like most bee and wasp venoms, is primarily only dangerous to humans who are allergic or are stung many times. All species have yellow or white on their faces. The mouthparts are well-developed with strong mandibles for capturing and chewing insects, with probosces for sucking nectar, fruit, and other juices. Yellow jackets build nests in trees, shrubs, or in protected places such as inside man-made structures, or in soil cavities, mouse burrows, etc. They build them from wood fiber they chew into a paper-like pulp. Many other insects exhibit protective mimicry of aggressive, stinging yellow jackets; in addition to numerous bees and wasps (M\u00fcllerian mimicry), the list includes some flies, moths, and beetles (Batesian mimicry).\nYellow jackets' closest relatives, the hornets, closely resemble them, but have larger heads, seen especially in the large distance from the eyes to the back of the head.[1]\nYellow jackets are social hunters living in colonies containing workers, queens, and males (drones). Colonies are annual with only inseminated queens overwintering. Fertilized queens are found in protected places such as hollow logs, in stumps, under bark, in leaf litter, in soil cavities, and man-made structures. Queens emerge during the warm days of late spring or early summer, select a nest site, and build a small paper nest in which they lay eggs. After eggs hatch from the 30 to 50 brood cells, the queen feeds the young larvae for about 18 to 20\u00a0days. Larvae pupate, then emerge later as small, infertile females called workers. Workers in the colony will take over caring for the larvae, feeding them with chewed up food, meat or fruit. By midsummer, the first adult workers emerge and assume the tasks of nest expansion, foraging for food, care of the queen and larvae, and colony defense.\nFrom this time until her death in the autumn, the queen remains inside the nest, laying eggs. The colony then expands rapidly, reaching a maximum size of 4000 to 5000[2] workers and a nest of 10,000 to 15,000 cells in late summer. At peak size, reproductive cells are built with new males and queens produced. Adult reproductives remain in the nest fed by the workers. New queens build up fat reserves to overwinter. Adult reproductives leave the parent colony to mate. After mating, males quickly die, while fertilized queens seek protected places to overwinter. Parent colony workers dwindle, usually leaving the nest to die, as does the foundress queen. Abandoned nests rapidly decompose and disintegrate during the winter. They can persist as long as they are kept dry, but are rarely used again. In the spring, the cycle is repeated; weather in the spring is the most important factor in colony establishment. Adults feed primarily on items rich in sugars and carbohydrates, such as fruits, flower nectar, and tree sap, and larvae feed on proteins, such as insects, meats, and fish. Adult workers chew and condition the meat fed to the larvae. Larvae in return secrete a sugar material relished by the adults; this exchange is a form of trophallaxis. In late summer, foraging workers pursue other food sources from meats to ripe fruits, or scavenge human garbage, sodas, picnics, etc., since larvae in the nest fail to meet requirements as a source of sugar.\nDolichovespula species such as the aerial yellow jacket, Dolichovespula arenaria, and the bald-faced hornet, tend to create exposed aerial nests. This is a feature shared with some true hornets, which has led to some naming confusion.\nVespula species, in contrast, build concealed nests, usually underground.\nYellow jacket nests usually last for only one season, dying off in winter. The nest is started by a single queen, called the \"foundress\". Typically, a nest can reach the size of a basketball by the end of a season. In parts of Australia, New Zealand, the Pacific Islands, and southwestern coastal areas of the United States, the winters are mild enough to allow nest overwintering. Nests that survive multiple seasons become massive and often possess multiple egg-laying queens.[3][4]\nIn 1975, the German yellow jacket (Vespula germanica) first appeared in Ohio, and has now become the dominant species over the Eastern yellowjacket. It is bold, aggressive and can sting repeatedly and painfully if provoked. It will mark aggressors, and will pursue them if agitated. It is often confused with Polistes dominula, an invasive species in the United States, due to their very similar pattern. The German yellow jacket builds its nests in cavities\u2014not necessarily underground\u2014with the peak worker population in temperate areas between 1000 and 3000 individuals between May and August. Each colony produces several thousand new reproductives after this point through November. The eastern yellow jacket builds its nests underground, also with the peak worker population between 1000 and 3000 individuals, similar to the German yellow jacket. Nests are built entirely of wood fiber and are completely enclosed except for a small entrance at the bottom. The color of the paper is highly dependent on the source of the wood fibers used. The nests contain multiple, horizontal tiers of combs within. Larvae hang within the combs.[citation needed]\nIn the southeastern United States, where southern yellow jacket (Vespula squamosa) nests may persist through the winter, colony sizes of this species may reach 100,000 adult wasps.[3] The same kind of nest expansion has occurred in Hawaii with the invasive western yellow jacket (Vespula pensylvanica).[5]\nThe yellow jacket's most visible place in American popular culture is as a mascot, most famously with the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets, represented by the mascot Buzz. Other college and university examples include the American International College, Baldwin-Wallace University, Black Hills State University, Cedarville University, Defiance College, Graceland University, Howard Payne University, LeTourneau University, Montana State University Billings, Randolph-Macon College, University of Rochester, University of Wisconsin\u2013Superior, West Virginia State University, and Waynesburg University.\nYellow Jacket has also been used as the name of multiple superheroes, including the fourth superhero identity of Marvel Comics character Hank Pym; the villainess turned hero Rita Demara, who stole the identity from Pym; and YellowJacket, a Charlton Comics character who got his powers from being bitten by mutant yellow jackets. A fictional type of yellow jacket was used in The Hunger Games. They are called \"tracker jackers,\" a genetically mutated species that's lethal to all people from repeated stings.\nIn Dr. Steel's street team, the Toy Soldiers, the Yellowjacket award is a patch in the shape of a stylized wasp, which is given to soldiers who make distinguished efforts and contributions."], ["Yellow Jacket: iPhone Cases with Concealed Stun Gun for ...", "http://www.yellowjacketcase.com/", "\nJavaScript seems to be disabled in your browser.\n                    You must have JavaScript enabled in your browser to utilize the functionality of this website.                \nWe appreciate your ongoing patience...

The nest becomes larger during the summer as yellowjackets add new comb layers, each containing developing larvae. The colony declines in late fall when workers die off.\nPaper wasp.\nPaper wasp nest.\nMud dauber.\nOnly a few of the very large number of wasp species in California live a social life. These species are referred to as social wasps. Some social wasps are predators for most or all of the year and provide a great benefit by killing large numbers of plant-feeding insects and nuisance flies; others are exclusively scavengers. Wasps become a problem only when they threaten to sting humans. In California, yellowjackets are the primary pests among the social wasps.\nIn Western states there are two distinct types of social wasps\u2014yellowjackets and paper wasps. Yellowjackets are by far the most troublesome group, especially ground- and cavity-nesting ones such as the western yellowjacket, which tend to defend their nests vigorously when disturbed. Defensive behavior increases as the season progresses and colony populations become larger while food becomes scarcer. In fall, foraging yellowjackets are primarily scavengers, and they start to show up at picnics and barbecues, around garbage cans, at dishes of dog or cat food placed outside, and where ripe or overripe fruit are accessible. At certain times and places, the number of scavenger wasps can be quite large.\n  Paper wasps are much less defensive and rarely sting humans. They tend to shy away from human activity except when their nests are located near doors, windows, or other high-traffic areas.\n  Typically, previously mated, overwintering yellowjacket and paper wasp queens begin their nests in spring when the weather becomes warm. The queen emerges in late winter to early spring to feed and start a new nest. From spring to midsummer, nests are in the growth phase, and larvae require large amounts of protein. Workers forage mainly for protein at this time\u2014usually other insects\u2014and for some sugars. By late summer, however, the colonies grow more slowly or cease growth and require large amounts of sugar to maintain the queen and workers; foraging wasps are particularly interested in sweet things at this time. Normally, yellowjacket and paper wasp colonies live only one season. In very mild winters or in coastal California south of San Francisco, however, some yellowjacket colonies survive for several years and become quite large.\nThe term \u201cyellowjacket\u201d refers to a number of different species of wasps in the genera Vespula and Dolichovespula (family Vespidae). Included in this group of ground-nesting species are the western yellowjacket, V. pensylvanica, which is the most commonly encountered species and issometimes called the \u201cmeat bee,\u201d and seven other species of Vespula. V. vulgaris is common in rotted tree stumps at higher elevations, and V. germanica, the German yellowjacket, is becoming more common in many urban areas of California, where it frequently nests in houses.\n  These wasps tend to be medium sized and black with jagged bands of bright yellow\u2014or white in the case of the aerial-nesting D. (formerly known as V.) maculata\u2014on the abdomen and have a very short, narrow \u201cwaist,\u201d the area where the thorax attaches to the abdomen.\n  Yellowjackets commonly build nests in rodent burrows, but they sometimes select other protected cavities, such as voids in walls and ceilings of houses, as nesting sites. Colonies, which are begun each spring by a single reproductive female, can reach populations of between 1,500 and 15,000 individuals, depending on the species.\n  The wasps build a nest of paper made from fibers scraped from wood mixed with saliva. It is built as multiple tiers of vertical cells, similar to nests of paper wasps, but enclosed by a paper envelope around the outside that usually contains a single entrance hole. If the rodent hole isn\u2019t spacious enough, yellowjackets will increase the size by moistening the soil and digging. Similar behavior inside a house sometimes leads to a wet patch that develops into a hole in a wall or ceiling.\n  Immature yellowjackets are white grublike larvae that become white pupae. The pupae develop adult coloring just before they emerge as adult wasps. Immatures normally aren\u2019t seen unless the nest is torn open or a sudden loss of adult caretakers leads to an exodus of starving larvae.\n  Aerial-nesting yellowjackets, D. arenaria and D. maculata, build paper nests that they attach to the eaves of a building or that hang from the limb of a tree. The entrance normally is a hole at the bottom of the nest. These aerial nesters don\u2019t become scavengers at the end of the season, but they are extremely defensive when their nests are disturbed. Defending D. arenaria sometimes bite and sting simultaneously. Wasp stingers have no barbs and can be used repeatedly, especially when the wasp gets inside clothing. As with any stinging incident, it is best to leave the area of the nest site as quickly as possible if wasps start stinging.\nPaper wasps such as Polistes fuscatus aurifer, P. apachus, and P. dominula are 1-inch-long slender wasps with long legs and a distinct slender waist. Background colors vary, but most Western species tend to be golden brown or darker with large patches of yellow or red.\nPreferring to live in or near orchards or vineyards, they hang their paper nests in protected areas, such as under eaves, in attics, or under tree branches or vines. Each nest hangs like an open umbrella from a pedicel (stalk) and has open cells that can be seen from beneath the nest. Sometimes white, legless, grublike larvae can be seen from below. Paper wasp nests rarely exceed the size of an outstretched hand, and populations vary between 15 to 200 individuals. Most species are relatively unaggressive, but they can be a problem when they nest over doorways or in other areas of human activity such as fruit trees.\nMud daubers are black and yellow thread-waisted solitary wasps that build a hard mud nest, usually on ceilings and walls, attended by a single female wasp. They belong to the family Sphecidae and aren\u2019t social wasps but might be confused with them. They don\u2019t defend their nests and rarely sting. During winter, you can safely remove the nests without spraying.\nConcern about yellowjackets is based on their persistent, pugnacious behavior around food sources and their aggressive defense of their colony. Usually stinging behavior is encountered at nesting sites, but sometimes scavenging yellowjackets will sting if someone tries to swat them away from a potential food source. When scavenging at picnics or other outdoor meals, wasps will crawl into soda cans and can sting your lips or the inside of your mouth or throat.\nReactions to wasp stings vary from only short-term, intense sensations to substantial swelling and tenderness, some itching, or life-threatening allergic responses. These reactions are discussed in detail in Pest Notes: Bee and Wasp Stings. Of specific concern is a condition that results from multiple-sting encounters, sometimes unfamiliar to attending health professionals, that is induced by the volume of foreign protein injected and the tissue damage caused by destructive enzymes in wasp venom. Red blood cells and other tissues in the body become damaged, and tissue debris and other breakdown products are carried to the kidneys, to be eliminated from the body. Too much debris and waste products can cause blockages in the kidneys, resulting in renal insufficiency or renal failure. Patients in this condition require medical intervention, which can include dialysis.\nMost social wasps provide an extremely beneficial service by eliminating large numbers of other pest insects through predation and should be protected and encouraged to nest in areas of little human or animal activity. Although many animals prey on social wasps\u2014including birds, reptiles, amphibians, skunks, bears, raccoons, spiders, praying mantids, and bald-faced hornets\u2014none provides satisfactory biological control in home situations.\n   The best way to prevent unpleasant encounters with social wasps is to avoid them. If you know where they are, try not to go near their nesting places. Wasps can become very defensive when their nest is disturbed. Be on the lookout for nests when outdoors. Wasps that are flying directly in and out of a single location are probably flying to and from their nest.\n   Usually, scavenging wasps won\u2019t become a problem if there is no food around to attract them. When nuisance wasps are present outdoors, keep foods including pet food and drinks covered or inside the house, and keep garbage in tightly sealed garbage cans. Once wasps discover food, they will continue to hunt around that location long after the source has been removed.\nIf wasp nests must be eliminated, it is easiest and safest to call for professional help. In some areas of California, personnel from a local mosquito and vector control district may be available to remove nests. To determine if this service is available in your area, call the Mosquito & Vector Control Association of California at (916) 440-0826. If a rapid solution to a severe yellow\u00adjacket problem is essential, seek the assistance of a professional pest control operator or consider installing bait stations.\nTrapping is one method that can be employed to try to reduce yellowjacket problems. Trapping isn\u0092t suggested for other social wasp species.\nThe easiest to use are lure traps, which are available for purchase at many retail stores that sell pest control supplies. Lure traps can help reduce the number of localized foraging workers, but they don\u2019t eliminate large populations. Lure traps contain a chemical that attracts yellow\u00adjackets into the traps, but the common lure in traps, heptyl butyrate, attracts primarily the western yellowjacket and not other species. Meat such as chicken can be added as an attractant and is believed to improve catches of the German yellowjacket and V. vulgaris. Replace meat frequently, because yellowjackets aren\u2019t attracted to rotting meat. Also, periodically check the trap to remove trapped yellowjackets and make sure workers are still attracted to the trap. Lures need to be replaced periodically; follow trap directions regarding replacement.\n  To reduce the number of yellowjackets foraging in specific areas such as patios, picnic tables, concession stands, and Dumpsters, place lure traps with hepytl butyrate around the periphery. In large areas such as parks, place traps about 200 feet from the area to be protected and about every 150 feet along the circumference. In backyards, place them along the edge of the property line as far away from the patio or other protected area as possible. To intercept foraging yellowjackets, it is important to place the traps between the area to be protected and the native landscapes serving as nesting sites. Typically yellowjackets will forage about 1/4 mile.\nWater traps generally are homemade and consist of a 5-gallon bucket, string, and protein bait such as turkey, ham, fish, or liver. Fill the bucket with soapy water, and suspend the protein bait 1 to 2 inches above the water. A wide mesh screen over the bucket will help prevent other animals from reaching and consuming the bait. After the yellowjacket removes the protein, the yellowjacket flies down and becomes trapped in the water and drowns. Like the lure trap, these traps also work best as queen traps in late winter to early spring. In summer and fall they might assist in reducing localized foraging workers but usually not to acceptable levels. Place water traps away from patio or picnic areas, so wasps aren\u2019t attracted to your food as well.\nIn the past, poison bait products were available to reduce yellowjacket populations later in the season when their prey is no longer available and some species turn to scavenging. However, reliable products were taken off the market in the early 2000s. Esfenvalerate products that recently became available haven\u2019t been shown to be effective in research trials.\nEarly in the season, simply knocking down newly started paper wasp nests will cause the founding female to go elsewhere to start again or to join a neighboring nest as a worker. As there is little activity around newly started wasp nests, they are very difficult to find. Wasps are more likely to be noticed after nests and populations grow. Nest removal for controlling subterranean or cavity-dwelling yellowjackets isn\u2019t practical, because the nests are underground or otherwise inaccessible.\nAerosol formulations of insecticides labeled for use on wasp and hornet nests can be effective against yellowjackets and paper wasps, but the products must be used with extreme caution. Wasps will attack if they sense a poison being applied to their nests, and even the freeze-type products aren\u2019t guaranteed to stop all wasps that come flying out. It is prudent to wear protective clothing that covers the entire body, including a veil over your face and gloves. In addition, you need to wear protective eyewear and other clothing to protect yourself from pesticide hazards.\n   Wasps are most likely to be in the nest at night, but even after dark and using formulations that shoot an insecticide stream up to 20 feet, stinging incidents are likely. Underground nests can be quite a distance from the visible entrance, and the spray might not get back far enough to hit the wasps. Partially intoxicated, agitated wasps are likely to be encountered at some distance from the nest entrance, even the day after an insecticidal treatment. Hiring a pest control professional will reduce risks to you and your family; in some areas of California, this service might be available through your local mosquito and vector control district.\n\nWARNING ON THE USE OF CHEMICALS\n\nAkre, R.

That's the great thing about gardening \u2014 it's never boring! I've worked as a landscaper, on an organic farm, as a research technician in a plant pathology lab and ran a small cut-flower business, all of which inform my garden writing. A few years ago my husband and I purchased a beautiful old Victorian house and opened a pet-friendly B&B; I've spent the last few summers renovating garden beds and adding new ones. My husband once asked me when I'll be finished, to which I replied, \"Never!\" For me, gardening is a process, not a goal.\nDifficult to distinguish from a yellow jacket, this is most likely a European paper wasp \u2014 a yellow jacket probably would have stung me before I could take the photo. Like the yellow jacket, it has a smooth, bright yellow and black body with a well-defined waist and thin legs.\nHoneybees have relatively plump and fuzzy bodies. Their hind legs are flattened, and you'll often see yellow pollen attached.\nBumblebees are much larger, plumper and fuzzier than honeybees.\nClosely resembling a honeybee, this non-stinging hoverfly is the gardener's friend. The larvae feed on insect pests, including aphids, scale, caterpillars, mealybugs and thrips. The adults pollinate flowers.\nMany non-stinging insects, such as this hummingbird moth, have the same coloration as stinging insects. \nThis honeybee is dusted with yellow pollen, which it will inadvertently transfer to other flowers as it gathers nectar and pollen to bring back to the nest.\nAlthough the appearance and sting of an individual Africanized honeybee are similar to those of a regular (European) honeybee, Africanized honeybees are far more dangerous. More akin to yellow jackets in their behavior, Africanized honeybees are easily provoked, attack in large numbers, and will pursue their victims over long distances, up to a quarter mile. They're also less particular about nesting sites and may set up home in any cavity, including places such as an overturned flowerpot, a tire or a mailbox.\n Researchers brought African bees to Brazil in 1956; they escaped and began mating with European honeybees to produce the much more aggressive hybrids dubbed \"Africanized bees.\" They reached the southern U.S. in 1990 and, although currently a threat in the southern tier of states as far north as Oklahoma and northern Utah, they're moving northward at a rate of about 200 miles per year.\nIf you see thousands of honeybees in the sky or a huge mass  clustered in a tree branch, just stand back and watch. \nThe bees are swarming. They've decided their colony is too large for the hive, so they've created a second queen bee, and half the bees and a queen are off to find a new home. \nThe swarming bees are docile \u2014 their bellies are full of honey and they don't have a home to defend. If they alight in your yard, contact a local beekeeper who may be interested in capturing the swarm. \nYou're outdoors enjoying a late-summer picnic and within minutes, dozens of yellow, flying insects intrude on your fun. People often think, \"Bees!\" but these uninvited guests are just as likely to be yellow jackets, a type of ground-nesting wasp. Often confused with bees, yellow jackets are much more aggressive, and most reported \"bee stings\" may in fact be yellow jacket stings. As a former hobby beekeeper, it's my duty to stand up for bees and set the record straight!\nIn spring and early summer, yellow jackets are carnivores, feeding mostly on insects to provide protein to developing larvae in their colony. In doing so, they help keep garden pests, such as caterpillars, in check. As the season progresses, their population grows and their diet changes to include more sugars. As natural food sources become scarce, they turn to scavenging, and that's when you'll find them lurking around garbage cans and pestering picnickers. A few yellow jackets here and there are a nuisance, but a nest of them in your yard can pose a real hazard.\nYellow jackets often nest underground in rodent burrows, so if you see lots of  flying insects emerging from a hole in the ground, they're probably yellow jackets. By late summer, a colony may contain thousands of individuals that will aggressively defend their nests from intruders. They're easily provoked and will attack in force, chasing the perceived threat for large distances. What's worse, each yellow jacket can sting multiple times. Sounds and vibrations, such as those from a mower or trimmer, can trigger an attack, even from a distance.\nIf a yellow jacket nest poses an immediate threat to passersby, including pets, then you may need to take actions (see When Yellow Jacket Control is Necessary, below). Be sure to positively identify the insects, however. You don't want to inadvertently destroy the nests of bees or other look-alikes.\nGetting to know the habits of various flying insects will help you identify them and decide if they pose a serious enough threat that you need to take steps to control them. Here are some other common summer visitors; keep in mind that all, including yellow jackets, are beneficial in the garden, by eating pest insects and/or as pollinators. \nPaper wasps and hornets, like yellow jackets, are social wasps (that is, they form colonies) but they nest aboveground. They also help control garden pests. Both can inflect nasty stings and can be aggressive, but they don't scavenge like yellow jackets and so are less likely to show up at outdoor activities.\nHoneybees nest in cavities, such as hollowed out tree trunks (or in beekeepers' boxes). In contrast to yellow jackets, honeybees are relatively gentle (with the exception of Africanized honeybees). Bees that are out foraging among flowers for nectar and pollen usually sting only if stepped on or swatted. If you approach their nest, they'll defend it but only within the immediate area. They won't chase you hundreds of yards like yellow jackets will. A honeybee can sting only once. When it stings, its barbed stinger and the attached venom sac are ripped from its body, killing it. So the honeybee stings only as a last resort, sacrificing its life to protect the colony.\nBumblebees nest underground, but they are so big they're easy to distinguish from other bees and yellow jackets, and a colony rarely tops 100 individuals, in contrast to the thousands in a yellow jacket colony. Bumblebees will chase invaders and will pursue them further than honeybees, but they won't come out in droves like yellow jackets because their colonies are relatively small. Like a yellow jacket, an individual bumblebee can sting multiple times.\nSome solitary bees nest in the ground but they don't form colonies (although several may nest near one another, giving the appearance of a colony). Solitary bees, such as mason bees, mining bees, leafcutter bees and sweat bees, rarely if ever sting and definitely don't gang up on intruders. Count yourself lucky if they call your garden home; they're great pollinators.\nThere are many nonstinging insects that resemble bees, too. Examples including hoverflies, bee flies and even hummingbird moths.\nHere are some general tips on avoiding insect stings. \nYellow jacket traps can help keep the population of a nest in check if they're set out in spring and early summer, when the population in the yellow jacket colony is small. Later in the season, placing the traps around the perimeter of an outdoor seating area may help reduce their pestering, but the traps won't do much to reduce the overall population. \nIf you're stung by a bee, you may be near the nest; leaving the area will prevent further stings. A honeybee will leave its barbed stinger in your skin; remove it by scraping the sting site with your fingernail, a butter knife, a credit card or something similar. Don't try to pull it out or you'll squeeze the attached sac and inject more venom. Other bees and wasps don't leave their stingers behind so this step isn't necessary.\nIf you're stung by a yellow jacket, wasp or hornet, run! The insect may leave behind a chemical that marks you as the enemy, inciting other yellow jackets to attack. Don't swat at the insects, just get away quickly.\nSeek medical help immediately if:\nAnyone suspecting they are allergic should carry a bee sting kit, such as an epi-pen. \n There are commercial sting remedies available, but many people swear by homemade concoctions. Apply any of the following to the sting site:\nIce will help reduce swelling and ease pain, as will aspirin and ibuprofen. Antihistamines and cortisone cream may reduce swelling and itching. \nWhenever possible, leave yellow jacket nests alone and let them continue to prey on pest insects; the ensuing cold weather will cause the colony to die off. However, if the nest is in a well-traveled area and poses a risk, you may need to take action.\nThe easiest and safest  the option is to hire a professional.  If you're determined to do it yourself, know that the likelihood of getting stung is high. \nApply control measures on a cool evening. The insects will be back home from the day's foraging, and they're more sluggish in cool temperatures. Always wear protective gear, ideally beekeeper's attire.\nSmother them. Mike McGrath, host of WHYY's You Bet Your Garden talk show and former editor-in-chief of Organic Gardening magazine suggests this procedure: Fill a wheelbarrow with  ice and quickly dump it over the hole. Then cover the hole and the area around it with a heavy tarp weighed down with bricks, a piece of sheet metal, a big wooden board, or other heavy object. Then cover that with soil or wood chips. Or cover the hole with a thick piece of clear plastic, seal the edges tight to the ground, and the nest will cook in the sun once the ice melts.\nBoil or drown them. Some gardeners report success with pouring 10-plus gallons of boiling water into the nest. Other say soapy water does the same thing. Remember, any insects that you don't kill on contact will come after you.\nSpray them. Numerous wasp control sprays are available, including organic ones with mint oil as the active ingredient. There are also sprays that freeze upon contact. Some people report better luck using pesticide dusts rather than sprays. If you choose one of these methods, follow label directions very carefully, taking all precautions.\nDo NOT pour gasoline, kerosene or any other flammable or toxic liquid into the hole. If it doesn't kill on contact it will infuriate the insects. And it will poison the soil. \nGet the latest news, tips and gardening info!\nAssembly instructions, diagrams and other types of product information are available on product pages.

They can be distinguished from bees by their thin \"waists.\" Bees are thick-wasted. Yellow jackets fold their wings lengthwise when at rest. Like all wasps, yellow jackets prey on a variety of insects and other arthropods. Yellow jackets will also forage on foods that people eat, especially sweets and meats. They are considered beneficial insects, because they eat other insects. They are a nuisance to people however, because they are aggressive and leave painful stings.\n        The yellow jacket colony will remain active for only one summer, after which the queens will fly away to start more colonies. The remaining ones die at the end of the season, and the nest is not reused.\n\r\nIf a colony is disturbed, the yellow jackets can become very aggressive and sting. Make sure to inspect for yellow jacket nests, before mowing the lawn or using trimmers. For most people, the yellow jacket sting is temporary, but painful. However for allergic individuals, a single sting may result in a serious reaction that requires medical treatment.\nTypes of Yellow Jackets and Yellow Jacket Nests\nYellow Jackets are of the Vespula species and are social wasps. The German Yellowjacket is located across the northeastern and midwestern regions of the USA. It may also be found in western areas of the United States, such as Washington, Idaho, and California. The German Yellowjacket usually nests in structures, wall voids, crawlspaces, attics and cracks and crevices in the exterior surface of a building. Yellowjackets make nests of paper from fibers in wood and saliva.\n The Western Yellowjacket makes their nests in the ground and is usually referred to as, \"meat bees.\" Yellowjackets will also use rodent burrows for nests, enlarging the cavity as the colony develops. You can see small stones or dirt particles piled up around the openings of a burrow that is used to house a large yellow jacket colony.\n Some Yellowjackets, (D. areanara and D.maculata) build aerial nests hanging from a tree or attached to the eaves of buildings. These yellow jackets are not as aggressive.\n Here is an excellent video from University of California describing the difference between yellow jackets, wasps and mud daubers.         \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\r\n       Trapping Yellow Jackets may be used to trap with a lure like fruit juice or meat like :\u00a0\nYELLOW JACKET TRAP by Advantage, which would be helpful if you can't find the location of the nests.\r\n     \n \n\n\n\n\nContact \u00a0|\u00a0 Customer Service\u00a0|\u00a0USDA Extension Locations\u00a0|\u00a0Disclaimer\n\n\u00a9 2014 Do It Yourself Pest Control \n"], ["Yellow Jacket iPhone stun gun case | Indiegogo", "https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/yellow-jacket-iphone-stun-gun-case", "We greatly appreciate any and all support!

They measure 10 to 16 mm in length. Most yellow jackets are black and yellow, although some may exhibit white and black coloration. In contrast to the bee, the yellow jacket\u2019s waist is thinner and defined. Their elongated wings are as long as the body and fold laterally when at rest.\nYellow jackets are wasps that can be identified by their alternating black and yellow body segments and small size. They are often mistaken for bees, although their bodies lack the same amount of hair, rounded abdomen, and the expanded hind leg used for carrying pollen of the bee. These social wasps live in colonies that may contain thousands of insects at a time.\nYellow jackets are pollinators and may also be considered beneficial because they eat beetle grubs, flies and other harmful pests. However, they are also known scavengers who eat meat, fish and sugary substances, making them a nuisance near trash receptacles and picnics.\nMany yellow jackets are ground-nesters. Their colonies can be found under porches or steps, in sidewalk cracks, around railroad ties or at the base of trees. Sometimes the queen uses a wall void of a building as a nesting place. Some yellow jackets build aerial nests in bushes or low-hanging branches or in the corners of buildings and other manmade structures.\nA queen yellow jacket starts a new nest by building a small paper nest in which she lays the first batch of eggs. After hatching, these eggs are fed by the queen until they are ready to pupate and mature into adult yellow jackets. Adults live through one season and feed on caterpillars, grubs and other insects. They also enjoy nectar and sweet substances such as fruit and tree sap. Yellow jackets are attracted to garbage and other human foods, particularly meats and sweets.\nA colony may contain 1,000 or more workers by fall. All of the workers are sterile females. In late summer males will begin to appear. When they become adults, they will mate with the females that will become the next year\u2019s queens. The fertilized females will hibernate through the winter. The workers and the males will perish when the weather turns cold.\nYellow jackets usually are detected when workers are encountered. Nests, particularly the aerial nests, also may be a sign.\nKnown to be aggressive defenders of their colonies, yellow jackets are otherwise not quick to sting. The sting of a yellow jacket is painful, and each insect is capable of delivering multiple stings. Because they are equipped with lance like stingers with small barbs, compared to the larger barbs in honey bees, yellow jackets are capable of stinging repeatedly. Yellow jacket stings may induce severe allergic reactions in some individuals.\n\nHow Big Does a Yellow Jacket Nest Get?\nQueen Yellow Jacket\nYellow Jacket Bees\nWestern Yellow Jacket Wasps\nYellow Jacket Life Cycle\nYellow Jacket Stings\nYellow Jacket Traps\n\n\t\tGive us a call:\n        \n844-514-3980\n\n\nOr schedule a call with an Orkin Specialist today and get a FREE estimate for:\n\n\t\tThis branch appears close by:\n\t\t\n\n,  \n\n\nNot in ?\n\t\tEnter a zip code below to view local branches.\n\n See more photos here \n\u00a0"], ["Eastern Yellow Jacket", "http://www.fcps.edu/islandcreekes/ecology/eastern_yellow_jacket.htm", "Vespula\nmaculifrons\n\nE.R.

The females are\nthe only ones with stingers.\nAn Eastern Yellow Jacket colony\ncan have up to 5,000 members, ruled over by a queen. Female workers\nwill go out looking for food for the larvae\n(baby yellow jackets). Adult yellow jackets drink nectar\nfrom flowers, but the workers will kill other insects to feed to the\nlarvae.\nOnce the female has captured and\nkilled her prey,\nshe will cut it into pieces and carry each piece back to the nest.\nThen she will chew the piece into a paste. The worker will next\n\"tickle\" the larva which will begin salivating (releasing\nsaliva).\nThe worker will drink the saliva, at the same time delivering the\npaste to the larva. This process is called \"malaxation.\"\nYellow Jackets will sometimes\ncollect moisture and nutrients from dead animals, such as the frog\npictured below:\n\nEastern Yellow Jackets build their\nnests using materials such as rotted wood fibers, dead stem fibers,\nand coccoon\nsilk (from caterpillars). Sometimes they will include pieces of paper\nor string. They chew the materials into pulp and build layers of\nchambers on top of each other.\nEastern Yellow Jackets, despite\ntheir reputation, are very beneficial\nto people, since they kill many insect pests.\n\n\n\nAdditional\n         Media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nType\n\n\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nEastern\n                  Yellow Jacket\n\n\nSound\n\n\nUnknown\n\n\n\n\nYellow\n                  Jacket Coloring Page\n\n\nLink to Printable\n                  Page\n\n\nEnchantedLearning.com\n\n\n\n\nYellow\n                  Jacket's Head Under a Microscope\n                  #1\n\n\nLink to\n                  Image\n\n\nUglybug.org\n\n\n\n\nYellow\n                  Jacket's Head Under a Microscope\n                  #2\n\n\nLink to\n                  Image\n\n\nUglybug.org\n\n\n\n\nYellow\n                  Jacket's Head Under a Microscope\n                  #3\n\n\nLink to\n                  Image\n\n\nUglybug.org\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nType\n\n\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nEastern\n                  Yellow Jacket\n\n\nSound\n\n\nUnknown\n\n\n\n\nYellow\n                  Jacket Coloring Page\n\n\nLink to Printable\n                  Page\n\n\nEnchantedLearning.com\n\n\n\n\nYellow\n                  Jacket's Head Under a Microscope\n                  #1\n\n\nLink to\n                  Image\n\n\nUglybug.org\n\n\n\n\nYellow\n                  Jacket's Head Under a Microscope\n                  #2\n\n\nLink to\n                  Image\n\n\nUglybug.org\n\n\n\n\nYellow\n                  Jacket's Head Under a Microscope\n                  #3\n\n\nLink to\n                  Image\n\n\nUglybug.org\n\n\n\n\nRelationships in\nNature:\n\n\n\nPREY/FOOD\n\n\nPREDATORS\n\n\nSHELTER\n\n\nOTHER\n\n\n\n\nField\n         Cricket\n\n\nBullfrog\n\n\nRed\n         Maple\n\n\nLeast\n         Shrew SP\n\n\n\n\nHoney\n         Bee\n\n\nRaccoon\n\n\nBlack\n         Willow\n\n\nAmerican\n         Holly Po\n\n\n\n\nBlack\n         Carpenter Ant\n\n\nWood\n         Frog\n\n\nAmerican\n         Sycamore\n\n\nBull\n         Thistle Po\n\n\n\n\nGoldenrod\n\n\nLeast\n         Shrew\n\n\n\n\n\nGoldenrod\nPo\n\n\n\n\nBull\n         Thistle\n\n\nAmerican\n         Toad\n\n\n\n\n\nEastern\n         Tent Caterpillar Moth\nSP\n\n\n\n\nAmerican\n         Holly\n\n\nGreen\n         Darner\n\n\n\n\n\nPainted\n         Lady SP\n\n\n\n\nDifferential\n         Grasshopper\n\n\nGoldenrod\n         Spider\n\n\n\n\n\nChicory\nPo\n\n\n\n\nGolden\n         Northern Bumble Bee\n\n\nBig\n         Brown Bat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChicory\n\n\nChinese\n         Mantid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat\n         Crested Flycatcher\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStriped\n         Skunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack\n         and Yellow Argiope\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarolina\n         Chickadee\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEastern\n         Mole\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpotted\n         Salamander\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack\n         Crappie\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouthern\n         Leopard Frog\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorthern\n         Mockingbird\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTufted\n         Titmouse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField\n         Cricket\nBullfrog\nRed\n         Maple\nLeast\n         Shrew SP\nHoney\n         Bee\nRaccoon\nBlack\n         Willow\nAmerican\n         Holly Po\nBlack\n         Carpenter Ant\nWood\n         Frog\nAmerican\n         Sycamore\nBull\n         Thistle Po\nGoldenrod\nLeast\n         Shrew\n\nGoldenrod\nPo\nBull\n         Thistle\nAmerican\n         Toad\n\nEastern\n         Tent Caterpillar Moth\nSP\nAmerican\n         Holly\nGreen\n         Darner\n\nPainted\n         Lady SP\nDifferential\n         Grasshopper\nGoldenrod\n         Spider\n\nChicory\nPo\nGolden\n         Northern Bumble Bee\nBig\n         Brown Bat\n\n\nChicory\nChinese\n         Mantid\n\n\n\nGreat\n         Crested Flycatcher\n\n\n\nStriped\n         Skunk\n\n\n\nBlack\n         and Yellow Argiope\n\n\n\nCarolina\n         Chickadee\n\n\n\nEastern\n         Mole\n\n\n\nSpotted\n         Salamander\n\n\n\nBlack\n         Crappie\n\n\n\nSouthern\n         Leopard Frog\n\n\n\nNorthern\n         Mockingbird\n\n\n\nTufted\n         Titmouse\n\n\nRelationship to\nHumans:\nEastern Yellow Jackets, as\nmentioned above, are great pest controllers.

Our Quality Report Card helps us \u2014 and you \u2014 keep track of how we're doing.\nFollow us with your favorite RSS feed reader.\nBy Jennifer Rea\n \nThe September sun is making for a warm evening, and your family has just sat down to a delicious meal on your back porch. Then it happens. That first yellow jacket makes its appearance zipping around the table. Suddenly another one joins the first on its journey from side dish to side dish. Then another. And another. Soon your family is charging inside, plates in hand, to avoid the swarm of hungry yellow jackets set on interrupting your backyard barbecue. \n \nThis has been an unusually popular season for yellow jackets. So much so that the Department of Natural Resources has been accused of releasing them as biological control agents. In a recent article, the DNR explained that they are not responsible for the increased amount of yellow jackets disturbing camping trips and barbecues, but rather our wet spring is to blame. \n \nYellow jacket (or wasp) stings can be a very serious medical situation for some people. We interviewed\u00a0Dr. Bret Lambert\u00a0of the Emergency Department at MultiCare Good Samaritan Hospital to find some answers to commonly asked questions regarding yellow jacket stings.\n \nWhat is the difference between a bee sting and a yellow jacket sting?\n \nYellow jackets can cause a very severe, sometimes fatal, allergic reaction. However it would take a very large amount of bee stings to cause someone to become ill. Also a yellow jacket can sting a person multiple times, but a bee can only sting once. \n \nHow do I know if I\u2019m allergic?\n \nWhen someone has an allergic reaction to a yellow jacket sting they generally break out in hives and have difficulty breathing. If someone is stung and they begin going into anaphylactic shock, the sting can become fatal within 5 minutes. \n \nFor this reason Dr. Lambert encourages patients with a history of many allergies or who have had a previous allergic reaction to a yellow jacket sting to carry an EpiPen. In an emergency situation where a person has been stung and they are going into anaphylactic shock, a shot of epinephrine can be the difference between life and death.\n \nWhat should I do if I get stung? \n \nIf the skin appears red around the site of the sting this is only a local reaction, and a cold compact should decrease the inflammation. If it is red and there is noticeable swelling you should take an antihistamine such as Benadryl in addition to applying a cold compress.\nIf hives appear at the site of a sting on a child under the age of 16, it is a less serious reaction than if hives were present on someone over the age of 16.\n \n\u201cIf hives become visible after a sting, but the person\u2019s breathing is normal, they should make sure to remain in the presence of others aware of the sting. Delayed allergic reactions are not too common, but are very possible, and if that person begins having difficulty breathing they needed to be taken to the hospital immediately,\u201d explains Dr. Lambert.\n \nWhen should I seek treatment from a doctor?\n \nThose who are allergic to yellow jacket stings still have only a 50% chance of reacting when stung. If you are someone with a history of this allergy, you should have your primary physician refer you to an allergist for desensitization therapy. \n \n\u201cThrough a series of allergy shots, an allergist can reduce an allergic person\u2019s chance of having a serious reaction from 50% down to 10%,\u201d said Dr. Lambert.\n \nFive basic tips for treating yellow jacket stings:\n \n \n\n\nLearn more about\u00a0childhood allergy testing and treatment at Mary Bridge Children's Hospital.\u00a0\n\n800-342-9919 All Contacts\n\u00a92014 MultiCare, All Rights Reserved.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\tTerms of Use | Privacy | Sitemap\u00a0\u00a0\t\t\t\t\tWebsite Design and Development by SiteCrafting\n"], ["Yellowjackets | Missouri Department of Conservation", "http://mdc.mo.gov/discover-nature/field-guide/yellowjackets", "Yellowjackets are bee-sized social wasps that build paper nests, usually underground. They usually have beelike black and yellow bands on their abdomens, but unlike honeybees, they are not hairy, nor do they collect pollen. Yellowjackets have yellow or white faces. When resting, they usually hold their wings down their back (not spread out). Right before landing, they often fly quickly side to side.\nYellowjacket nests are made of paper like those of paper wasps, but they have multiple parallel layers of comb with downward-facing cells (paper wasps always only have a single layer of cells). Yellowjacket nests are always enclosed in a wood-pulp paper envelope built by the wasps.\nYellowjackets are widely, and incorrectly, called \"sweat bees\" in Missouri.\nYellowjackets are a significant stinging threat: They nest in colonies and aggressively defend their nest as a group. Individuals can sting repeatedly.\nPaper wasps are the most familiar of Missouri's social wasps. A late summer nest bristling with dozens of wasps can be an impressive sight. If you have a garden, however, these wasps are your friends!\nMany species and genera of sand wasps occur in Missouri. They nest in the ground during summer. They are found in many habitats but most often in open, sandy areas along rivers.\nMost ichneumon wasps are harmless, although the long ovipositor of the female is intimidating. Their larvae live as parasites inside caterpillars and other larval insects.\nBald-faced hornets are fairly large wasps that are primarily black, with white or ivory markings on the face, thorax, and toward the tip of the abdomen. The large, rounded, papery, gray nests of this social insect are frequently seen in natural history displays.\nHorntails look a lot like wasps but have a taillike spine that projects from the tip of the abdomen. Their cylindrical bodies also lack the narrow waist so common in wasps.\nVelvet ants are not true ants. True ants are social insects, while velvet ants are a group of solitary wasps. Female velvet ants are wingless throughout their lives; males are winged.\nA large solitary wasp, the great golden digger wasp is found throughout Missouri. The abdomen is orange in front and black at the end. The head and thorax have golden hairs. Like all solitary wasps, this species is not aggressive.\nMDC protects and manages Missouri's fish, forest, and wildlife resources.\nWe also facilitate your participation in resource-management activities, and we provide opportunities for you to use, enjoy and learn about nature.\nFind out more\nMDC protects and manages Missouri's fish, forest, and wildlife resources.\nWe also facilitate your participation in resource-management activities, and we provide opportunities for you to use, enjoy and learn about nature.\nCheck out the featured picture and other images at the MDC Media Gallery\n        "], ["RESCUE!\u00ae - Yellowjackets", "http://www.rescue.com/bug/yellowjackets", "To ensure optimal functionality of this website, it is recommended you enable your browser's javascript.\nProducts\nBig Bag Fly Trap\nDisposable Fly Trap\nDisposable Yellowjacket Trap\nJapanese  & Oriental Beetle Trap\nPOP!

You\u2019ll find the bright yellow and black insects in the backyard, at picnics and other outdoor activities.\n\n\t\t\tThey scavenge for meat and sweet liquids, which brings them into frequent contact with humans. Yellowjacket attacks can be deadly for people who are allergic to their stings.\n\n\t\t\tAlthough many people see their yellow and black markings and label them \"bees\", yellowjackets are actually a type of wasp. Yellowjackets, paper wasps and bees are differentiated by several physical characteristics.\n\n\t\tYellowjackets are more aggressive than other stinging insects such as wasps, hornets, mud daubers or bees. Yellowjackets can sting and bite. Since they don't lose their stinger, they can sting numerous times, and will do so unprovoked.\n\n\t\tYellowjackets vigorously defend their nests. Swarm attacks can occur when someone accidentally steps in or hits a nest opening. Ground vibrations can also trigger attacks from underground nests -- thus, mowing lawns can be hazardous during the late summer season when colonies are large.\n\n\t\tMost yellowjacket workers forage for food within 1,000 feet of their nest -- a distance of three football fields.\n\n\t\tIn the middle of the season -- usually June or July -- yellowjackets are drawn to protein sources, such as hamburgers on the barbecue grill. During the late summer to early fall, they tend to shift their diet to sweets, including soda and juice.\n\n\t\tYellowjacket nests are usually built underground, although some species will construct their nests in hollow logs, trees, attics, between walls, or under eaves of houses. An underground yellowjacket nest is difficult to locate because the entrance is about the size of a nickel.\n\n\t\tYellowjacket nests are established by a single queen in the spring. She builds 20-45 cells, lays eggs in them as they are constructed, and forages for nectar and arthropod prey to feed the developing larvae. In about 30 days, the first 5-7 workers emerge and take over the nest-building functions while the queen lays more eggs.\n\n\t\tYellowjackets construct their nests of plant fibers gathered from weathered or decayed wood or even living plants. A yellowjacket nest consists of a number of rounded combs attached one below another. The combs are usually covered with a layered envelope allowing only one opening. A \"guard\" will usually be stationed at the entrance of a nest to warn of possible danger.\n\n\t\tNest size varies from 300 to 120,000 cells, although the majority of nests average 2000 to 6000 cells and are 3-6 inches in diameter. The largest yellowjacket nests are those of perennial colonies, which do not die out over winter but continue on for additional seasons with multiple queens. These would be most likely found in warmer climates. The nest of one such colony in California was discovered to be nearly 4 feet long, and a nest found in Florida was 9 feet tall. In November 2000, a nest was discovered in a park in Clermont, Florida that measured about 6 feet in height and 8 feet across and weighed 200 pounds. A pest control operator estimated that it contained 25,000 yellowjackets. The record for any yellowjacket nest probably belongs to a nest found in 1960 in New Zealand, which was nearly 15 feet tall, probably contained several million cells in about 1890 combs, and weighed an estimated 1,000 pounds!\n\n\t\tThe nest decomposes after the season ends and is not reused.\n\n\t\tIt is important to note that a nest need not be on your property to cause a yellowjacket problem, since yellowjackets can travel up to 1,000 feet (a distance of 3 football fields) from the nest to forage for food.\n\n\t\tIf you do have a nest on your property, we recommend calling a pest control operator to remove it because of the danger involved.\n\n\t\tThe onset of spring's warmer temperatures can bring an unwelcome invader: the queen yellowjacket, searching for a spot to settle and start her colony for the summer.\n\n\t\tYellowjacket queens spend the winter in sheltered locations, such as under loose tree bark or in decaying stumps.\n\n\t\tDuring the first warm days of spring, when the daytime temperatures consistently reach the upper 60s to low 70s Fahrenheit, the queen emerges to look for a new site for her nest. The most frequent nest sites are underground, but some yellowjackets have been known to nest in wall voids of a house.\n\n\t\tYellowjacket colonies started by just one queen can grow to include anywhere from 400 to 5,000 workers later in the season.\n\n\t\tTo prevent some yellowjacket nests from ever being established, you can use the RESCUE!\u00ae Yellowjacket Trap to catch the queens in early spring. Every queen caught in the spring means fewer yellowjackets will be around to torment you in the summer.\n\n\t\tCatching queens at this time will not decimate the yellowjacket population. But it does decrease the likelihood that yellowjackets will build a nest on or near your property.\n\n\t\tYellowjacket colonies grow exponentially. A colony started by a single queen can produce thousands of workers -- hundreds of which are fertilized at the end of the season and become new queens themselves. The original queen dies, but the new queens overwinter and each produces a new colony the following year.\n\n\t\t\tYellowjackets are aggressive and can be unpredictable \u2014 especially in late summer when their colonies are at their largest. Taking precautions can help you avoid being stung.\n\n\t\t\tWhat to do if you\u2019re stung by a yellowjacket:\n\n\t\t\tSigns you may be allergic:\n\n\t\t\tIf you experience any of these symptoms, seek medical attention immediately.\nCopyright \u00a9 2014\u00a0Sterling Rescue :: All Rights Reserved\n\n\t\t\tProducts\nBig Bag Fly Trap\nDisposable Fly Trap\nDisposable Yellowjacket Trap\nJapanese  & Oriental Beetle Trap\nPOP!

He soon switched from using capsules to a Pym particle-filled gas, but eventually his body had absorbed enough particles to shrink and grow at will. At one point, Pym found himself able to use the Pym particle field about his body to shrink and grow objects in contact with him, and he carried various high and low tech equipment in his jumpsuit. Currently, he can only shrink and grow objects that have been specially-treated with Pym paticles beforehand. When fully grown as Giant-Man or Goliath, he also exhibits superhuman strength.AbilitiesPym is a brilliant scientist in both the feilds of robotics/cybernetics and biochemistry. During his carreer, he created robot Ultron, explored and repaired the Vision often, and created much of the Avengers' equipment. Another robot, Rover, was a jet with rudimentary artificial intelligence and sophisticated offensive capabilities. His greatest scientific acheivement, however, was the discovery of \"Pym particles\" that enable mass to be shunted or gained from an alternate dimension.WeaponsAs Yellowjacket, Pym used his shrinking ability along with a bio-energy gun (later incorporated into blasting gauntlets.)ParaphernaliaIn his insect guises, Pym used a communication device in his helmet that allowed him to communicate and control insect life (mostly ants) and a loudspeaker that enabled him to be heard while shrunken.  As Ant-Man, he often used miniaturized equipment such as a slingshot-type vehicle to propel him to trouble spots around Manhattan.Launch Connections\nHeightvaries, normally 6'\n\n\nWeightvaries, normally 185 lbs.\n\n\nEyesBlue\n\n\nHairBlond\n\nOne day he discovered a process in which he would manipulate a newly discovered group of subatomic particles through magnetic fields. Pym tested the serums on himself, and had accidentally shrunk himself to the size of an ant and was trapped inside an anthill. Once normal sized, Pym destroyed the serums, thinking that they were too dangerous . He rethought his decision, and recreated the serums, dubbing them \"Pym  Particles\" and developing a formula that would enable himself to shrink and return to normal size. He also worked on a cybernetic helmet to enable him to communicate and study ants. Pym was also working on behalf of the government to find to work on a formula to help provide immunity to low-level radiation. It was then that several Soviet KGB Agents broke in, attempting to kill Pym and destroy his work. Pym donned the cybernetic helmet and newly designed protective suit, shrank himself, and escaped outside, to the anthill. There, he gained control of the ants, and attacked the agents and freed his assistants.\n\nAnt-Man and the Wasp were mistakenly called to battle the Hulk with heroes Thor and Iron Man. When the heroes discovered that the Hulk was innocent and it was all a trick formulated by Loki, Pym and the Wasp suggested they form a team, combining their different powers to fight evil, and the Wasp named the team the Avengers. Pym continued to fight alongside the Avengers, but soon felt outclassed by the powerhouses of the team and created the identity of Giant-Man. Later still, Pym proposed to Janet, and the two briefly left the team for their marriage. Pym found himself back in the Avengers, creating another identity of Goliath. Although he usually preferred abstain from adventuring to stay in his lab, he continued to fight off-and-on alongside the Avengers because the Wasp always wanted to.\n\nYears later, Pym, who was undergoing severe mental stress, had an accident in his laboratory, breathing in chemical fumes. His sanity warped, and created a fourth identity: Yellowjacket. He returned to the Avengers, kidnapping Janet and forcing her to marry him. When he was confronted by the Avengers and brought back to his right mind, Pym and Janet decided to let the marriage stand. They adventured with the Avengers, and later, they enjoyed a brief tenure alongside the heroes of the Defenders.\n\nPym's mental problems continued to worsen. He returned to the Avengers, determined to prove himself alongside the heavyweights of the team, which only added to his stress. At one point, he struck Janet, and later, during battle with the misguided Elfqueen, Pym lashed out at her just as she was about to surrender. The Avengers began a court-martial process for Pym, who, losing his sanity, created a robot to destroy the Avengers-- but built with a failsafe that Pym would activate to \"save\" his friends and regain his status. The ploy failed, and the Wasp, who discovered Pym's treachery, saved the team. Pym promptly quit, and the Wasp filed for divorce. Pym was further oppressed as his old enemy Egghead framed Pym for stealing nuclear devices, leading to Pym's arrest. Egghead led the Masters of Evil in freeing Pym from his trial, further implicating him in villainy. Pym soon defeated the Masters single-handedly, redeeming himself, but he decided against rejoining the Avengers. Pym later would ally with them when his expertise was needed. Over time, his relationship with the Wasp was reconciled.\n\nLater still, Pym found his body could not handle the stress of constant size-changing, and he retired from costumed crime-fighting. He still joined the Avengers, however, when they opened their West Coast branch, in order to oversee the facilities and the scientific research. Growing more despondent, however, he soon decided to commit suicide but was stopped by their associate Firebird (then Espirita,) who helped him to reconcile the two areas of his life-- costumed crime-fighting and scientific research. As Hank Pym, Scientific Adventurer, he would use the aura of Pym Particles his body produced in order to shrink and grow objects around him, and he rejoined the Avengers full-time, often acting as field leader.\n\nAlthough he stayed with the West Coast branch for some time, Pym soon found himself actively adventuring from the New York mansion. Later still, Pym and other size-changing heroes and villains were caught up in an invasion attempt from the natives of the dimension Kosmos, the place where Pym particles stem from. The outcome left Pym able to grow again but not to shrink, and he resumed his old Giant-Man identity.\n\nPym was on hand with the other Avengers who seemingly sacrificed their lives to absorb the energies of the being known as Onslaught. In reality, he was shunted to another dimension. When he and the other heroes were restored to Earth, Pym found that he was capable of his full range of size-changing abilities, although he could not shrink and grow other objects unless he specifically treated them in his laboratory. He and the Wasp also returned to their previous romantic relationship.\n\nPym helped reorganize the Avengers with the Wasp and their teammates, stopping the menace of the sorceress Morgan Le Fay. He then agreed to stay on as a reserve member, returning to his laboratory work full-time. Pym and the Wasp would join with the Avengers on an as-needed basis, such as helping them thwart the villainous Grim Reaper. During this time, Pym switched to his Goliath identity once again.\n\nPym's research was monitored by Ultron, who later kidnapped Pym and other of its so-called \"family.\" Ultron revealed that Pym had used his own brain patterns as a template for Ultron's intelligence, and Ultron intended to do the same with all members of its \"family\" when building a new robot army with Pym's latest research. Ultron was confronted by the Avengers, who freed Pym and allowed him to deliver the blow that defeated Ultron. Soon after, Goliath and the Wasp rejoined the Avengers full-time.\n\nAt one point, when investigating the machinations of the barbarian sorcerer Kulan Gath, who had transformed a South American village into a version resembling his native time period, Pym was transformed into a giant version of his Yellowjacket identity. Although he was quickly restored to normal, the reversion had unconsciously allowed the Yellowjacket identity to form for itself a body out of the extradimensional mass Pym used to grow. Pym had long sought to suppress the impulsive, egotistical Yellowjacket and instead rely on rationality and prudence, and now the two sides of his personality shared the same mass in the form of two separate bodies. \"Yellowjacket\" surreptitiously helped \"Goliath\" and the Avengers escape Kulan Gath, and he secretly followed them back to their Mansion headquarters. Soon, Yellowjacket kidnapped Goliath, imprisoning him and taking his place as Goliath among the Avengers.\n\nAlthough many of his teammates recognized \"Goliath's\" strange behavior, no one suspected the truth. Yellowjacket would occasionally succumb to debilitating pain, a stress of drawing upon the same mass. The strain eventually became too much, and Yellowjacket began to fade away. Unaware of what was happening, the Avengers found only one source of help, their former enemy, Jonathan Tremont of the Triune Understanding. Tremont helped Pym confront the two sides of personality, and he merged together to restore himself to normal. Pym rejoined the Avengers and assumed his Yellowjacket identity once more, claiming that it would be as Yellowjacket, the identity that gave him the most problems, that he would face his problems and find out if he was truly cured.\n\nPym and the Wasp renewed their romantic relationship, often taking time off together like a whirlwind trip to Las Vegas. Pym again proposed to Janet van Dyne, but she declined, fearing that he might one day lose control under stress. The Wasp then began to explore different avenues of her life. She started to use her size-changing powers to grow in size similar to Giant-Man. She also had a dallying affair with her teammate Hawkeye, which Pym walked in on. The Wasp, Hawkeye, and Pym avoiding come to terms with this uncomfortable new love triangle, as the Avengers were suffered a series of sudden and devastating attacks from friends and enemies alike, part of which resulted in She-Hulk starting a rampage. The Wasp was summarily swatted aside and remanded into a coma. When she recovered, she and Pym renewed their relationship once more. The couple chose not to resume membership when the Avengers disbanded, and Pym took an offer as a research scientist at Oxford University.   \n\nAfter the Skrull Invasion, Pym adopted the codename Wasp in tribute to his deceased partner and rejoined the Avengers, leading a team of his own. During the time when his teammates were fighting the Unspoken, the entity Eternity named Pym Earth's Scientist Supreme (the scientific counterpart to the Sorcerer Supreme). Soon after Pym and his team defeated the Unspoken, they fought and defeated Absorbing Man with the help of Norman Osborn's Avengers. Pym's Avengers were previously deputized by agents of G.R.A.M.P.A., ensuring Osborn couldn't arrest them, but that was only temporary. Pym would be asked to give aid during Osborn's siege of Asgard, but he could not due to the return of Ultron. \n\n\n\nSearch the Marvel Universe\nPOWERGRID\ndurability\nenergy\nfighting\nintelligence\nspeed\nstrength\nRelated Links\nFollow Marvel"], ["University of Rochester YellowJackets", "http://www.jackets.org/", "Ontario Public Library Presents: The Yellowjackets at Wayne Central High School\n\n\nThursday, April 24 @ 7:00 PMThu, Apr 24 @ 7:00 PM\n\n\n\nWayne Central High School, Ontario, NY\n\n\u00a0\n\nShare\n\nCrush Cancer Concert\n\n\nSaturday, April 19 @ 2:00 PMSat, Apr 19 @ 2:00 PM\n\n\n\nFairport High School, 1 Dave Paddock Way, Fairport, NY\n\n\u00a0\n\nShare\n\nMathew Carlin Senior Trombone Recital\n\n\nSaturday, April 12 @ 7:00 PMSat, Apr 12 @ 7:00 PM\n\n\n\nHatch Recital Hall (Eastman School of Music), 26 Gibbs St., Rochester, NY\n\n\u00a0\n\nShare\n\nRelay for Life\n\n\nFriday, April 11 @ 1:15 AMFri, Apr 11 @ 1:15 AM\n\n\n\nUniversity of Rochester, 300 Wilson Blvd., Rochester, NY\n\n\u00a0\n\nShare\n\nUniversity of Rochester 2018 Experience\n\n\nWednesday, April 9 @ 9:20 AMWed, Apr 9 @ 9:20 AM\n\n\n\nHubbell Auditorium (University of Rochester), 300 Wilson Blvd., Rochester, NY\n\n\u00a0\n\nShare\n\nThe YellowJackets' Spring Senior Show\n\n\nFriday, April 4 @ 8:00 PMFri, Apr 4 @ 8:00 PM\n\n\n\nStrong Auditorium, Rochester, NY\n\n\u00a0\nTBA\n\n$15 General Public\n\n\nShare\n\nICCa Mid-Atlantic Semifinal\n\n\nSaturday, March 29 @ 7:00 PMSat, Mar 29 @ 7:00 PM\n\n\n\nNicholas Music Center, 85 George Street, New Brunswick, NJ\n\n\u00a0\nCome support us as we compete against:\nThe Deaftones | Westminster Choir College\nCounterparts UPenn | University of Pennsylvania\nCasual Harmony | Rutgers University\nVocal Synergy | Wagner College\nVocalign | Elizabethtown College\nMelica | Elizabethtown College\nThe NYU N'harmonics | New York University\nFordham Ramblers | Fordham University\nIC Voicestream | Ithaca College\n\nShare\n\nGananda Concert\n\n\nFriday, March 7 @ 7:00 PMFri, Mar 7 @ 7:00 PM\n\n\n\nGananda High School, Gananda, NY\n\n\u00a0\n\nShare\n\nSaint Bonaventure Performance\n\n\nThursday, March 6 @ 7:30 PMThu, Mar 6 @ 7:30 PM\n\n\n\nSaint Bonaventure College, 3261 W State Rd, St. Bonaventure, NY\n\n\u00a0\n\nShare\n\nICCA Mid-Atlantic Quarterfinal\n\n\nSaturday, March 1 @ 7:00 PMSat, Mar 1 @ 7:00 PM\n\n\n\nHendricks Chapel, 900 S Course Ave, Syracuse, NY, US\n\n\u00a0\nWith your support, we'll make it to the Semifinals!\n\n$20 General Admission, $18 Students\n\n\nShare\n\nDelta Gamma Charity Auction\n\n\nSaturday, February 22 @ 5:00 PMSat, Feb 22 @ 5:00 PM\n\n\n\nUniversity of Rochester, Rochester, NY\n\n\u00a0\n\nShare\n\nThe Sing-Off Live Tour\n\n\nWednesday, February 19 @ 8:00 PMWed, Feb 19 @ 8:00 PM\n\n\n\nTurning Stone Resort & Casino, Verona, NY\n\n\u00a0\n\nShare\n\nProctor's Theatre Performance\n\n\nSaturday, February 1Sat, Feb 1\n\n\n\nProctor's Theatre, 432 State St, Schenectady, NY\n\n\u00a0\n\n$25 General Admission, $20 students\n\n\nShare\n\nOpening Act for \"Enter The Haggis\"\n\n\nSaturday, November 30, 2013 @ 8:00 PMSat, Nov 30, 2013 @ 8:00 PM\n\n\n\nWater Street Music Hall, 204 N.

The most common type of bees in the Northern Hemisphere are the Halictidae species, also known as sweat bees. These are drawn to salt in animals and human sweat and are often mistaken for wasps or flies. The bees are annoying and will do just about anything to get to your skin. They will sting if squeezed. Perhaps you are wondering why these insects are particularly attracted to your skin and whether or not they are dangerous. The following sweat bee facts should help to answer some of your questions.\nSweat bees are spread throughout the world, except for Australia, Southeast Asia, and Antarctica. They find shelter in the ground, but some species can nest in wood. They prefer a warm climate and are typically seen in spring and summer, when they swarm in search of a new nest. They are particularly spread throughout North America and Canada. The insects can swarm over orchards and gardens and infest barren yards. These species of ground bees dig tunnels into the soil, bringing provisions of nectar and pollen inside for their offspring. They prefer dry soils and avoid damp areas.\nThe most common species in the Halictidae family are black, red, blue, or metallic green. They can be up to 1/2 an inch long, and they differ in size, depending on the species. The males usually have yellow markings on their backs and a distinct yellow head. They have hairy hind legs, which are used to collect large amounts of pollen. In solitary species, each female digs her own burrow and makes provisions for it. Males are often seen flying about in search of a mate. Only female sweat bees can sting, which is similar to most species of bees. The green metallic bee is a solitary species that lives on its own and doesn't depend on a colony for its survival.\nBecause they do not live in large colonies, sweat bees are less defensive than honey bees or wasps. While they are drawn to perspiration, they often lay down on your skin and can be squeezed by accident, often causing them to sting in defense. The sting is considered painless and does not become inflamed. However, persons that are allergic to insects should see a doctor immediately. Only provoked females sting.\nMost species of the Halictidae family are eusocial insects with a queen and workers, but their casts are not as well-defined as with honey bees. Their life cycle can differ from one species to another. Unlike honey bees, which repeatedly feed their young until they grow, sweat bees practice mass provisioning with their larvae. Inside the colony, the workers build a waterproof cell filled with nectar and pollen. The egg is laid upon it, and the cell is sealed. Therefore, the larvae is given all of its food at once. The pupae leave the cell during winter and develop into adults the following year.\nAlthough they are irritating creatures that fly around and constantly try to get to your skin during hot, summer days, these insects play an important role in pollination. They feed on flower nectar. They gather pollen to feed their young and can carry large amounts using their hairy hind legs. The bees visit a variety of flowers. Therefore, pesticides are not recommended for controlling these insects, as they are extremely beneficial to agriculture. If your garden has been invaded, you can simply cast them out by pouring water over the ground. Sweat bees hate water and will fly off to a different location.\nAll bees are fascinating creatures that play an important role on Earth. Without them, flowers would no longer be pollinated, and they would bare no fruits. In fact, all life depends on these small, flying insects, which are often considered a nuisance. Some lay on your skin and collect sweat drops. The salt in your perspiration is a delicacy for sweat bees, and they are generally trying to satisfy their cravings without an intent to harm.\n\nPlease login to add comments\n"], ["sweat or halictid bees", "http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/creatures/misc/bees/halictid_bees.htm", "Halictidae are one of the seven bee families in the order Hymenoptera. Also known as sweat bees, halictids are a very diverse group of metallic and non-metallic bees. They typically are more abundant than most bees with the exception of Apis (honey bee) species. Halictids display the most diverse gradation in social behavior (Michener 2007) as species can be solitary, communal, semi-social or eusocial. Some species exhibit solitary or eusocial behavior depending on time of year, geographic location, altitude and often unknown factors (Michener 2007). The genus Lasioglossum (=Dialictus) in Halictidae is one of the largest genera of bees worldwide, with an incredibly diverse array of behaviors. \n\nFigure 1. Adult Lasioglossum nymphale Smith, a  sweat bee, gathering pollen and nectar on goldenrod. Photograph taken in  Highlands County, Florida. Photograph by Tim Lethbridge. \n\nFigure 2. Adult Halictus poeyi Lepeletier, a  sweat bee, gathering pollen on lanceleaf coreopsis, Coreopsis lanceolata.  Photograph by Katie Buckley, University of Florida. \n  Halictid bees are found worldwide, but are especially abundant in temperate regions. Halictidae is split into four subfamilies: Rophitinae, Nomiinae, Nomioidinae and Halictinae. In Florida, there are 44 species found within eight genera. These genera include: Sphecodes (10 spp. of parastic bees), Lasioglossum (17 spp.), Nomia (4 spp.), Agapostemon (2 spp.), Augochloropsis (3 spp.), Augochlora (1 sp.), Augochlorella (3 spp.) and Halictus (4 spp.) (Pascarella 2006). Most of these species are also common throughout the eastern United States.\r\n\n  Halictid bees can vary greatly in appearance. While a select few are robust, most are slender bees. About 50% of the species are dull to metallic black, with the remaining species being metallic green, blue or purple. Female halictids carry pollen on the tibia and femur of their hind legs, except for parasitic species which do not carry pollen at all. Males usually resemble females of the same species except that they are often more slender, do not have scopa (area of long dense hairs on hind tibia used for carrying pollen) and sometimes have a yellow clypeus (sclerite below the antennae on the bee's face).  Mature larvae are grub-like in appearance, without setae, and usually less than 15 mm long. Pupae are very delicate and rarely encountered due to their brief developmental period (Michener 2007).\r\n\n\nFigure 3. Adult Agapostemon splendens (Lepeletier), a sweat bee. Photograph  by Jeff Hollenbeck. \n\nFigure 4. Adult Halictus poeyi Lepeletier, a  sweat bee, collecting pollen on Spanish needle, in Highlands County, Florida. Photograph by Tim Lethbridge. \n This family of bees can be separated from other families of bees by a strongly curved basal vein in the wing. The genus Lasioglossum can be  further separated by weak or reduced wing veins. \n\nFigure 5. Example of Halictid wing venation. Arrow  points to strongly curved basal vein which separates sweat bees from other  families of bees. Photograph by Katie Buckley, University of Florida.\n\nFigure 6. Example of Halictid (sweat bee) wing venation  in Lasioglossum, showing weak or reduced wing veins. Photograph by  Katie Buckley, University of Florida. \n  In general, many bee species overwinter as prepupae. Some halictids do the same, including females of the  subfamily Rophitinae. In Nomioidinae, both sexes overwinter. Halictinae and Nomiinae overwinter as mated adult females (Michener 2007, Wcislo & Engel 1996). In the spring or summer, the females emerge, mate if they have not already done so, and begin digging nests and provisioning cells with pollen and nectar. In each cell they lay a single egg. When the larva emerges from the egg, it consumes the pollen provision until the food is gone. The larva then defecates, and may or may not remain in this prepupal form that year depending on the species, season or other unknown factors. It is believed that some prepupae remain so for a year or more as a fallback for years of drought. Some prepupae, on the other hand, will pupate immediately and emerge as adults. Some of these adults also may remain in their cell over the winter, again depending on the species.\r\n  \n\nFigure 7. Augochlorini adult standing next to a broken  larval cell. The yellow pollen balls lining the cell are created by the female  before she deposits the eggs. These provisions then sustain the developing  larva until pupation and emergence as an adult. Photograph by Beatriz  Moisset. \n Most species are polylectic, or gather floral resources from multiple plant species. There are a few oligolectic species and subgenera that feed from a single plant family. Adult halictids eat nectar, and collect nectar and pollen for the larvae. All halictids are mass provisioners, that is, the adults provision each cell with all the food (pollen and nectar) a larva will need until it emerges. \n\nFigure 8. Lasioglossum sp. consuming nectar or water. Photograph  taken in Pierce County, Washington. Photograph by Lynette Schimming. \n  Most halictids nest underground. Nests that are built in rotting wood usually resemble ground nests (Eickwort & Eickwort 1973), or if that species is a parasite of other bees then nests are not built at all. Despite usually nesting in the ground, nesting behavior is otherwise highly variable between the species. Each subfamily has its own characteristic nesting habit:\r\n\n\n\nFigure 9.

Typical nest entrance for Augochlorini, a  tribe (group of genera in a subfamily) of sweat bees. Photograph by  Katie Buckley, University of Florida. \n  The family Halictidae contains a few social parasites and cleptoparasitic bee genera. These include Sphecodes, Microsphecodes and Lasioglossum. Sphecodes is parasitic on Halictus spp., while the other two are parasitic on other Lasioglossum spp. Sphecodes females typically kill the egg or larva in the cell before they lay an egg, but in most other cleptoparasitic species, eggs are laid on unfinished cell walls or through sealed cells and the larva of the cleptoparasite kills the other egg or larva before eating the host's stored food (Michener 2007).\r\n  \n\nFigure 11. Adult Sphecodes heraclei Cockerell, a  parasitic sweat bee, feeding on a flower. Photograph taken in Highlands County, Florida. Photograph by Tim  Lethbridge. \n\r\n  Sweat bees are very important pollinators for many wildflowers and crops, including stone fruits, pomme fruits, alfalfa and sunflower. Sweat bee populations can be encouraged with wildflower plantings and by providing nesting areas. Halictids typically nest in bare soil located in a sunny location. Minimum tillage and insecticide use will help to increase populations of Halictidae and other soil nesting bees.\r\n  \n\nFigure 12.

"], ["Sweat Bees | Missouri Department of Conservation", "http://mdc.mo.gov/discover-nature/field-guide/sweat-bees", "There are many species of sweat bees in several genera in Missouri. All are small; none are aggressive. They can be brightly colored or dark; they can be metallic; their markings vary from green to red to yellow, often with bands similar to those of honeybees. To humans, one of the most noticeable traits of sweat bees is their attraction to perspiration, which offers them precious moisture and salts.\nIn 1985, the honeybee was made Missouri's official state insect, and most people know how to identify it. This social insect is unquestionably a friend to humanity and has been for millennia. Today, more than ever, we rely on honeybees to pollinate our crops, as well as for the sweet honey that only they can make.\nBumblebees are fuzzy, familiar and are like huge honeybees: They are yellow and black, collect pollen and nectar, live in colonies and make honey. They are capable of stinging, if molested or if their nest is endangered, but you need not fear them; they are not aggressive.\nLeafcutter bees are common throughout Missouri from late spring into early autumn. All are solitary. They are dark-colored with several whitish hair bands across the abdomen. One sign of their presence is the rounded holes they cut in the leaves of plants.\nEastern carpenter bees somewhat resemble bumblebees but have a noticeably black, shiny abdomen. Also, they are rather solitary and excavate their nests in wood.

These bees are widespread and especially found in huge numbers in Northern parts of America. Since the sweat bees are very small, they are almost inconspicuous but at times hundreds of sweat bees swarm over the flowers in meadows and gardens. All types of bees along with the sweat bees are extremely vital to our eco-system. They play a crucial role in the sustenance of myriad plant species by carrying out pollination amongst vegetations scattered over large distances. There are many people who specifically strive to keep these bees alive so that the vegetation and crops in their region show abundant growth. Lately people have become more aware of the loss of bee population and are striving to keep their species alive.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSweat bees belong to the Hymenoptera family of insects which is one of the biggest insect families and\u00a0 includes some of the common insects ants, bees, sawflies and wasps in its group. Evolved from the Halictidae group of family, these bees are commonly found in Australia and Southeast Asia. Sweat bees range from 4mm-8mm in size and are black, brown, green, metallic to red in color. One of the features of\u00a0sweat bees is their prominent yellow face. These bees have\u00a0long hairy hind legs,which are easily mistaken for bumblebees. The long extended hairy legs are instrumental in transferring of pollen and nectar from the flowers to the beehive.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe male sweat bees do not sting. What we think as a sting is actually a pinch or bite by the sweat bees. Its the female bees that sting when we try to shoo them away from our skin. These bees attack our skin because they are attracted to the salt in our perspiration and pollen that\u00a0 gets lodged in our skin during the dispersion. These bees belong to Apidae class of bees and hence their sting is almost painless. According to the Schmidt Sting Pain Index, the sting intensity of sweat bees is 1.0 \u00a0which is low to minor pain.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSweat bees differ from other types of bees in their ways of nesting. Their hives are usually found inside the hollow trunk or wood or underground. Their nests are made for holding one female at one time, but sometimes the hives contain several female queen bees that live in the same hive but in different cells. Although each female bee has a separate hive, they stay very close to each other so much so that their whole lot looks like living in a group in one single hive nestled alongside shrubbery roots. These hives have couple of exits as well as entrances well guarded by the guard bees. Sweat bees build their hives in April and are later joined by female bees who have not built their nests. These added bees stay as workers but do not lay eggs. At the onset of summer there is only one egg laying bee who continues to produce offspring as long as she is fertile till the next winter.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSince more often the nests of sweat bees are under the ground, these bees store nectar and pollen and some parts of flowers as food. The larvae \u00a0survive by eating the nectar and pollen mass that is made available when the eggs are being laid. Just as athletes need electrolytes \u00a0for enhancing their energy and power, similarly, sweat bees need supplements of salts! They try to get this supplement from the perspiration of humans. In case sweat bees have made their nests in your garden or home ground and if you are feeling threatened you can destroy their nests by sprinkling Diazinon or liquid detergent during the night as during night these bees are almost inactive. Always be sure to cover yourself with thick clothes, face mask and boots while carrying out this activity.\nTo read more on Bees, click below:\u00a0\nDifferent Types of Bees\nWhy are bees vanishing\nLearn about the Colony Collapse Disorder\nBirds falling from the Sky\n\u00a0\nRelated Innopedia"], ["Honey Bees, Bumble Bees, Carpenter Bees, and Sweat Bees", "http://pods.dasnr.okstate.edu/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-2292/EPP-7317web%20color.pdf", ""], ["Augochlora Sweat Bee - Insect Identification", "http://www.insectidentification.org/insect-description.asp?identification=Augochlora-Sweat-Bee", "\r\nThe shiny, metallic green color of this bee are vivid and uncommon compared to the typical yellow and black image of bees. They are small bees and can vary in socializing.  Some daughters remain with their mothers to help rear the next generation, but they are more solitary than the more widely known honey bees that live in a hive. They are more tolerant of cool weather and are visibly active in late winter and early spring.\n\nIn the warmer southeastern U.S., they may appear more blue or purple in color.\n\nSweat bees have pollen baskets on their legs and collect it like other bees.  They can also sting like other bees.  Adults feed on flower nectar they collect, or steal it from aphids.  They can be found on flowers or on tree bark. Larvae feed on both pollen and nectar.\n\nFemales nest in rotting wood, in tunnels bored out by other insects (like beetle larvae), or underground in loose soil.  A female fills the end of the tunnel with cells and stuffs a pollen grain in each one with some nectar.  Then, she will lay one egg on each grain.  The larvae overwinter and emerge as adults in the spring having grown to maturity by feasting on the nectar and pollen grain left by the mother.\r\n\nCategory: Bee, Ant, Wasp and Similar\nCommon name: Augochlora Sweat Bee\nScientific Name: Augochlora\u00a0pura\n\nTaxonomy:\r\n\u00a0 Kingdom: Animalia\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Phylum: Arthropoda\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Class: Insecta\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Order: Hymenoptera\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Family: Halictidae\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Genus: Augochlora\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Species: pura\n\nAdult Size (Length): \r\n7mm to 8mm\r\n(0.28in to 0.31in) COMPARE\nIdentifying Colors: green; black\nGeneral Description: shiny, metallic, green, flying, stinging\nNorth American Reach (Though Not Limited To*): Alabama; Arkansas; Connecticut; Delaware; Florida; Georgia; Illinois; Indiana; Iowa; Kansas; Kentucky; Louisiana; Maine; Maryland; Massachusetts; Michigan; Minnesota; Mississippi; Missouri; Nebraska; New Hampshire; New Jersey; New York; North Carolina; Ohio;  Pennsylvania; Rhode Island; South Carolina; Tennessee; Texas; Vermont; Virginia;  West Virginia; Wisconsin; New Brunswick; Newfoundland and Labrador; Nova Scotia; Ontario; Prince Edward Island; Quebec\n* Keep in mind that insect reach is not governed by lines on a map and therefore may appear in areas/regions/states beyond those listed above.\n\u2022 Spiders\r\n\u2022 Beetles\r\n\u2022 Bees, Ants, Wasps and Similar\r\n\u2022 Butterflies and Moths\r\n\u2022 Dragonflies and Damselflies\r\n\u2022 Centipedes\r\n\u2022  Earwigs\r\n\u2022 Alderflies, Fishflies and Dobsonflies\r\n\u2022 Grasshoppers and Crickets\r\n\u2022 True Bugs\r\n\u2022 Walkingsticks and Timemas\r\n\u2022 Cicada and Similar\r\n\u2022 Flies and Mosquitoes\r\n\u2022 Mantises\r\n\u2022 Mites and Ticks\r\n\u2022 Scorpions or Scorpionlike\r\n\u2022 Cockroaches\r\n\u2022 Bristletails\r\n\u2022 Mayflies\r\n\u2022 Snakeflies\r\n\u2022 Antlions and Lacewings\r\n\u2022 Crustaceans\r\n\u2022 VIEW ALL\n\u2022 Indentifying Insects\r\n\u2022 Insect Anatomy\r\n\u2022 Insect Mouth Parts Guide\n\u2022 Anatomy of the Honey Bee\r\n\u2022 Insect Dichotomous Key \r\n\u2022 Arachnid Dichotomous Key \r\n\u2022 Taxonomic Orders\r\n\u2022 Insect Orders\r\n\u2022 Scientific Names\r\n\u2022 Metamorphosis\r\n\u2022 Molting Process Pictures\r\n\u2022 Winged Insect Key\n\u2022 Biting Insects\r\n\u2022 Flying Insects\r\n\u2022 Helpful Insects\r\n\u2022 Nursery Web Spider\r\n\u2022 Spiders.us\n\u2022 Alabama\r\n\u2022 Alaska\r\n\u2022 Arizona\r\n\u2022 Arkansas\r\n\u2022 California\r\n\u2022 Colorado\r\n\u2022 Connecticut\r\n\u2022 Delaware\r\n\u2022 Florida\r\n\u2022 Georgia\r\n\u2022 Hawaii\r\n\u2022 Idaho\r\n\u2022 Illinois\r\n\u2022 Indiana\r\n\u2022 Iowa\r\n\u2022 Kansas\r\n\u2022 Kentucky\r\n\u2022 Louisiana\r\n\u2022 Maine\r\n\u2022 Maryland\r\n\u2022 Massachusetts\r\n\u2022 Michigan\r\n\u2022 Minnesota\r\n\u2022 Mississippi\r\n\u2022 Missouri\r\n\u2022 Montana\r\n\u2022 Nebraska\r\n\u2022 Nevada\r\n\u2022 New Hampshire\r\n\u2022 New Jersey\r\n\u2022 New Mexico\r\n\u2022 New York\r\n\u2022 North Carolina\r\n\u2022 North Dakota\r\n\u2022 Ohio\r\n\u2022 Oklahoma\r\n\u2022 Oregon\r\n\u2022 Pennsylvania\r\n\u2022 Rhode Island\r\n\u2022 South Carolina\r\n\u2022 South Dakota\r\n\u2022 Tennessee\r\n\u2022 Texas\r\n\u2022 Utah\r\n\u2022 Vermont\r\n\u2022 Virginia\r\n\u2022 Washington\r\n\u2022 West Virginia\r\n\u2022 Wisconsin\r\n\u2022 Wyoming\nSite Disclaimer \u00a0|\u00a0 Privacy Policy \u00a0|\u00a0 Site Map\n\u00a92014 www.InsectIdentification.org.

One such example of another valuable pollinator is the sweat bee, or Halictidae, from the order of Hymentoptera. To date there have been 49 unique species of sweat bees identified.\nPhoto Credit: http://waynesword.palomar.edu/redmite8.htm\nThese tiny bees range from the less than 1/4 inch to 3/4 inch in length and can have bright, dark or metallic coloring. You may recognize the most commonly seen sweat bee with a green, metallic exoskeleton in the photo below. Sweat bees occupy a number of different habitats such as city sidewalk cracks or soil, but lucky for us, are non-aggressive. They most often nest in the ground though a few varieties make their homes in rotting wood. While some sweat bees are solitary others are more social, building nests together. For example, those that nest in the ground begin to do so in April, digging burrows in soil and then placing pollen and nectar at the end of the tunnels in preparation for larvae. Some of the overwintered females in the nest will take on the worker function while others will lay eggs and eventually, only one egg laying female remains. At this point some of the females will mate; lay eggs that overwinter as larvae or pupae, living through the winter to begin the process again the next spring.\nPhoto credit: http://greennature.com/gallery/wasp-pictures/halictus.html\nSweat bees benefit plants as they feed on nectar and pollen, pollinating in the process.\u00a0 You may be wondering where they get the name \u2018sweat bee.\u2019 While they do feed on pollen and nectar, the bee is also attracted to human perspiration. Yum. A light brush will dislodge them and they will most likely not bother you again, however if you do happen to get stung it is not a painful as that of a honey bee. Male sweat bees, common with Apis species, also do not sting. So although the bees can be annoying in the heat of the summer, they are really nothing to worry about, rather they are just another important pollinator that helps to keep our ecosystem running smoothly.\n\u00a0\nJennie Stitzinger has written 56 post in this blog.\nIn the summer of 2010 I walked in to the Penn State Agricultural Sciences building to inquire about a job a friend had mentioned to me.

They are most diverse and abundant in temperate regions and southwestern U.S. deserts. Agapostemon are commonly called \u201csweat bees\u201d because they are closely related to, and resemble bees in the Halictus and Lasioglossum genera.  Unlike those bees however, Agapostemon, are not attracted to human sweat. \nKey: Species of Agapostemon key.\nDescription: Agapostemon are brightly colored metallic green or blue bees.  They are medium sized ranging from 0.3 to 0.6 inches (7 to 14.5 mm) long. Most species have a bright metallic green head and thorax, and a black-and-yellow striped abdomen; some females are entirely bright green or blue. Females carry pollen on scopal hairs located on their hind legs. Female Agapostemon are relatively fast-flying bees. Males fly much more slowly because they are often searching flowers for females.  Under a microscope, you would look for a shield like indentation on the abdomen to confirm that a large bright green bee is an Agapostemon and the face of the propodeum on the thorax is completely encircled by a clearly raised line.\nSimilar insects: Osmia species can also be metallic green, but are more robust and carry pollen on the underside of the abdomen instead of on the hind legs. Some cuckoo wasps also look similar to Agapostemon.\nFood sources: Agapostemon are generalists. Like other members of the family Halictidae, they are short-tongued and thus have difficulty extracting nectar from deep flowers. Males can be observed flying slowly around flowers looking for females. \nNests: Agapostemon dig deep vertical burrows in flat or sloping soil, or sometimes in banks. Most species are solitary, but some species nest communally. Up to two dozen females may share a single nest entrance, but each individual builds and provisions its own cluster of brood cells.  Where a communal nest gallery shares a single entrance, one bee usually guards the hole, with only her head visible from above ground.\nFlight season: These are summer to fall bees\nDistribution\n\n\u2039 MIning Bees: Genus Andrena\nup\nSWEAT BEES: GENUS LASIOGLOSSUM \u203a\n\nBees: Responsible for Every Third Bite of Food."], ["Sweat Bee", "http://www.sites.ext.vt.edu/departments/entomology/factsheets/sweatbee.html", "\nSweat Bee\nContact: Eric Day, Manager, Insect Identification Laboratory\n\nRevised, September 1999\n\n\nSweat Bee\n\nSIZE: Less than 1/2 inch (12mm), usually less than 1/4\ninch (6mm)\n\nCOLOR: Metallic green\n\nDESCRIPTION: The sweat bee is a small metallic green bee that\nis commonly seen in the summer.\n\nHABITAT: Sweat bees build small nests in the ground, often in the form of a colony.\nThey stock the nest with pollen.

Cane, Bee Biology  & Systematics Lab, Logan, Utah.\nBy Vince Tepidino\nUSDA ARS (retired), Bee Biology & Systematics Lab, Logan, Utah\nMany students of pollination like to shine a spotlight on specialized  pollinators, species that collect pollen from flowers of a few kinds of plants.  Examples of such \"spotlighting\" can be seen in other Pollinator-of-the-Month  features such as those about globe mallow bees, squash bees, and pollen wasps. Such  examples seem to pique our sense of wonder and perhaps even satisfy our sense  of morality (\"Gosh, that pollinator and that plant are locked together in monogamy!\"). However, no less wonderful are the many other bee species,  especially in the family Halictidae (sweat bees), which seem to be  \"anti-specialists\". To paraphrase the early 20th century humorist  Will Rogers, they have never met a flower they did not like, and they rarely  find one whose pollen or nectar is unyielding. Such generalists visit a wide  variety of flowers and often seem to do so indiscriminately. Variety seems to  be the spice of their foraging lives. The gorgeous metallic-green sweat bee  (genus Agapostemon) in the picture to the right was photographed  visiting a wild rose flower on the Wyoming  prairie, but she could as readily have been snapped visiting any of five or  even ten other flower species on that single foraging trip.\nIt is hardly all fun and games for generalized foragers. Generalization  presents problems to the plants that seek to manipulate flower visitors in the  pollination game, as well as to the flower visitors themselves. Plants, after  all, \"want\" their flower visitors to confine their visits to flowers of the  same species, otherwise their pollen stands a good chance of being deposited on  stigmas of other species of flowers, and therefore wasted. The more different  kinds of flowers visited on a foraging trip, the lower the chances that any  pollination will occur. What's a plant to do?\nThere are many possible \"remedies\", all of which have probably  been \"tried\" by plants over evolutionary time. Only a few can be mentioned  here. One is to seize a part of the blooming period that is less crowded with  competitors, thereby increasing the likelihood that consecutive flower visits  will be to the same species. For example, natural selection might favor shedding  pollen at a time during the season and/or during the day when competition for  pollinators is less intense. Selection might also favor morphological  modifications in stamens or anthers that place pollen on a particular spot of  the insect body that is less likely to compete for carrying or deposition space  with pollen of other species.\n\n        Sweat bees have no fear of wild garlic. Here another species prepares to ply a garlic flower before someone throws it into their pasta sauce. Photo by James H. Cane, Bee Biology  & Systematics Lab, Logan, Utah.\nThere are also potential problems for the generalist  foragers themselves. One difficulty is metabolizing the contents of pollen  grains of different plant species. While pollen grains contain most of the  nutrients required by adult bees to mature and rear their offspring, including  proteins, starches, fats, and vitamins, plant species are by no means uniform  in their pollen constituents. Indeed, pollen grains of some species contain  toxic compounds. Thus, digesting pollen from many flower species, as  generalists must do, may require more sophisticated metabolic and  detoxification systems than possessed by bees that specialize.\nAnother problem for generalist foragers is learning  how to manipulate flowers of many plant species, each unique in floral morphology.  The behavioral repertoire required to extract pollen and nectar from flowers differs  for each plant species. Dealing with several flower types contemporaneously is  not easy for small-brained insects to learn. Several studies have shown that workers  of social bees such as honeybees and bumblebees forage less efficiently the  more flower types they visit. Social bees solve this problem by having  individual workers specialize on different plant species, rather than  generalize. The hive is thereby, generalized in its flower diet. In contrast, in  halictids, even though many species display rudimentary social behavior, individual  foragers are the generalists. Learning in halictid bees has not been studied,  but their ability to forage indiscriminately may signal that they are the  unrecognized geniuses of the bee world.\nForest Service Home | USDA.gov | recreation.gov | USA.gov | Whitehouse.gov\nPlug-Ins | FOIA | Accessibility Statement | Privacy Policy | Important Notices | Information Quality | Photo Credits & Use"], ["New Sweat Bee Generates Buzz - WSJ", "http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304356604577341683875011896", "NEW YORK\u2014A new bee is buzzing in Brooklyn: The tiny insect, the size of a sesame seed, sips the sweet nectar of the city\u2014sweat. \n\"They use humans as a salt lick,\" said entomologist John Ascher, who netted the first known specimen of the species in 2010 while strolling in Brooklyn's Prospect Park near his home. \"They land on your arm and lap up the sweat.\"\nNorth America is home to thousands of species of native bees. But they have long been overshadowed by imported honeybees, prized for their honey and beeswax since the time of the Pharaohs and a mainstay of commercial agriculture. Now, native bees are generating serious buzz. \n\n                New York City is a hive of activity and one of the most diverse cities in the world. It's also host to hundreds of bee species, including one newly discovered specimen that lives on human sweat. WSJ's Lee Hotz reports.\n                \n              \nFor Mr. Ascher, 41 years old, nothing quite brightens the day like a new box of unidentified bees landing on his desk from some distant glade. So puzzling was the greenish-blue city bee he netted, though, that it took Mr. Ascher, who oversees a digital catalog of 700,000 bee specimens at the American Museum of Natural History, months to pinpoint its proper place in the insect kingdom. \nIn the end, only DNA testing by sweat bee specialist Jason Gibbs at Cornell University could identify its niche. Last November, they announced the discovery of Lasioglossum gotham, in a peer-reviewed journal called Zootaxa. The newbie joined the growing catalog of easily overlooked wild native bees.\nSweat bees don't have a high profile outside academic circles. Unlike honeybees, which were originally imported from Europe, native bees don't make much honey. To their credit, though, sweat bees rarely sting; their occasional pinprick registers a one on the Schmidt Sting Pain Index, the lowest on the four-point scale. (Bullet ants and the tarantula hawk wasp rate a four.)\n\n                 A new species of sweat bee, Lasioglossum gotham, was discovered in the Brooklyn borough of New York in 2010, joining the growing catalog of easily overlooked wild native bees. Shown, a Lasioglossum gotham specimen.\n                  Jason Gibbs/Cornell University\n\nThese bees prefer sweaty people\u2014over most animals\u2014because the human diet usually is so salty that their perspiration is saturated with the essential nutrient, experts said. Yet most people never notice when the tiny bees alight on a bare arm or leg. \nAs it turns out, Mr. Ascher and his colleagues are discovering New York City is a hive of activity. \nBy latest count, about 250 species of native bees are known to nest in sidewalk cracks, traffic median strips, parks, and high-rise balcony flower pots\u2014more perhaps than any other major city in the world, several entomologists said. In Prospect Park alone, at least 90 species of native bees flit from flower to flower among the park's sun-dappled golden rod, dandelions and dogwood. \n\"For certain species, the city is as good as or better than a natural area,\" Mr. Ascher said.\nHovering around city parks and flower beds are masked bees, miner bees, mason bees, plasterer bees, cuckoo bees, leafcutter bees, horned bees, and at least 49 species of sweat bees. \"We routinely see bees 30 stories up in window gardens,\" Mr. Ascher said. A local bumblebee has even been spotted on the observation deck of the Empire State Building. \nSweat bees often live unobtrusively. \n\"You can have sweat bees nesting in your front yard and never know it,\" because they are so small and mild-mannered, said Cornell's Mr. Gibbs. \"Hundreds can nest in a square meter of lawn.\"\nAs an urban wilderness, New York City continues to surprise field biologists. Not so long ago, museum bug hunters discovered a new genus of centipedes\u2014perhaps the world's smallest\u2014under the fallen leaves in Central Park. In 2009, a new species of cockroach turned up in a West Side supermarket. Earlier this year, researchers at Rutgers University and the University of California identified a previously unknown species of leopard frog whose natural range centers on Yankee Stadium.\nThe discovery of this new sweat bee species\u2014which belongs to a large family of bee species that depend on human perspiration for salt to survive\u2014highlights the importance of the thousands of native bee species in pollinating plants, flowers and fruits. \nSweat bees aren't ready to swarm into the commercial workplace. But other native bees are gaining scientific attention at a time when honeybee hives are plagued by myriad problems that threaten their survival. \n\n              Sweat Bee\n               \n\n\"We've neglected the native bees because the honey bee was so successful,\" said entomologist Anne Averill at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst who is conducting a $3.3 million federal study of native bees in 10 states. They hope to expand the role of native bees in agriculture. \nNot a single native plant in North or South America actually needs a honeybee to survive, so long as native bees thrive, museum and university entomologists said. Untended and largely unnoticed, native bees play a role in pollinating cash crops such as tomatoes, cranberries, alfalfa and squash. They are more prevalent among farmers' fields than previously believed, often more effective than honeybees as pollinators and more resistant to the problems that have decimated honeybees in the U.S. and Europe, several studies show. \nUnlike many honeybees, urban bees in the Northeastern U.S. have adapted to rising temperatures, which have caused spring\u2014and the first bloom of flowers for pollination\u2014to arrive about 10 days earlier in recent years, Rutgers University researchers said.\nIt isn't easy keeping track of so many bees. \nSweat bees encompass an unusually broad range of behaviors, but often differ from each other in almost imperceptible ways. All that distinguishes the Gotham sweat bee from its most closely related species is the pattern of bristles on its abdomen and a few links of DNA. They are so hard to tell apart that agriculture experts world-wide are hard-pressed to take stock of them all.\n\"If there is a new bee species in New York, imagine the situation...somewhere in South America,\" said Mr. Ascher. \"It is hard to effectively manage pollinators if they have not been named scientifically.\"\nAt the American Museum of Natural History, Mr. Ascher and his colleagues scramble to keep up with requests to catalog unidentified bee species. Museum corridors are a honeycomb of bee boxes and specimen drawers packed with 450,000 preserved bees. \nAlmost every day new native bee specimens arrive in the mail. \n\"We are finding out these things at a fast pace,\" Mr. Ascher said. \"I just got another box of bees and there was a new species in Queens.\"\n Write to  Robert Lee Hotz at sciencejournal@wsj.com \nYour email has been sent.\nAn error has occurred and your email has not been sent.\n          Please try again.\n          \nContent engaging our readers now, with additional prominence accorded if the story is rapidly gaining attention.

Sweat bees belong to the family Halictidae and most are\u00a0small to medium-sized, 3 to 10 mm (0.12 to 0.40 ins) in length. They are generally black or metallic coloured and some are brilliant green or bright yellow. Sweat bees are among the most common bees and make up\u00a0the majority, number wise,\u00a0of bees wherever bees are to be found,\u00a0except in Australia and Southeast Asia.\u00a0There are about 1000 species in the United States, Canada and Central America alone and 20 in the UK.\nBecause of their small\u00a0size they are often mistaken for flies as they swarm sometimes in their\u00a0hundreds\u00a0over flowers in gardens or meadows, visiting a variety of plants. The different species are also often difficult to distinguish.\u00a0The males often\u00a0have a distinct yellow face, which is a common trait among many species of bees.\u00a0They have extended hairy hind legs, which often make people mistake some of the bigger species\u00a0for bumblebees. The hairs on their legs collect pollen which is carried back to the nest,\u00a0while also pollinating the plants they visit.\nLife Cycle\nThe life cycles of sweat bees vary tremendously among species. Most species nest in the ground, but some nest in wood. Nests usually consist of a single main tunnel having one or more clumped cells arising from lateral branches.\u00a0A wide range of social development is displayed in the sweat bee\u00a0family and\u00a0many insights into the evolution of social behaviour among insects have been learned from sweat bees.\nWhile all bumblebees and\u00a0honeybees\u00a0are social, sweat bees evolved (and are still evolving rapidly) sociality more recently\u00a0and exhibit the full range of behaviour, from strictly solitary to strictly social species, with a queen and some workers. Many species are solitary, that is, the female builds and occupies its nest alone. This is considered the basic, most primitive nesting behaviour. In some sweat bee\u00a0species, females nest communally, sharing a common nest entrance but constructing cells individually. Many species, including the common North American\u00a0Eastern sweat bee, show varying levels of sociality, passing through a continuum of stages in social development. In these species, there may be several egg-laying \u2018queens\u2019 with the other nest mates functioning as workers. Sometimes generations of these bees overlap and live together and there may be a division of labour among nest mates. However, unlike many social bees, such as honey bees, there appears to be little communication between adults.\nOf special interest are \u2018socially polymorphic\u2019 sweat bees, who take more than one social form within the same species. One of these\u00a0the socially polymorphic sweat bee Halictus\u00a0rubicundus is the subject of the study by Professor Field at the University of Sussex, England,\u00a0in collaboration with colleagues at Queen\u2019s University Belfast. In Britain and Ireland, northern or high-altitude populations of this bee are solitary, while southern, low-altitude populations of the same species are social.\nThe key experiment aimed to test whether individual bees could switch behaviour. The researchers transported bees between southern and northern locations,\u00a0for example, from Belfast in Northern Ireland, where bees are always solitary, to warm and sunny Brighton on the English South Coast. The result was that the previously solitary bees switched to social behaviour. In the reverse experiment, southern, social bees became solitary when transplanted to Peebles in Scotland.\nProfessor Field says: \u201cSweat bee sociality is thought to occur only where the growing season is long enough to permit two annual broods. First, the queen must rear some workers. Then the workers must help to rear a second brood of new queens. A bee that finds itself too far North may not have a long enough summer to do this. Our findings suggest that individual bees adjust their strategies according to the time remaining for queen production: the earlier a nest produces its offspring, the more likely those offspring are to become workers. The queen may also have an influence, because more of her offspring become workers if she is still alive when they are born.\u201d\nHe adds: \u201cOrigins of sweat bee sociality are linked with past episodes of climatic warming and sociality is today associated with warmer conditions. Rapid switching could thus help some sweat bees adapt to future warming and has probably allowed them to invade new biogeographic regions.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSweat Bees Sting\nThe males bite or pinch, while the females sting\u00a0when pinched or removed roughly from the skin as it collects salt from\u00a0our skin. The sting from a sweat bee however is much less painful than that from a honey bee.\n\u00a0\nParasitic Sweat Bees\u00a0\nIn some parasitic species of sweat bees, females invade the nests of other bees and lay their eggs in the food stored by the host bee. The sweat bee larva will then kill the host larva and consumes their food. The hosts are usually other species of sweat bees.\n\u00a0\nSee also\u00a0 Alkali Bees\n\u00a0\n\n<!--\ngoogle_ad_client = \"pub-7470726160490114\";\n/* 120x600, created 10/11/11 */\ngoogle_ad_slot = \"6070112209\";\ngoogle_ad_width = 120;\ngoogle_ad_height = 600;\n//-->\n\n\n\n<!--\ngoogle_ad_client = \"pub-7470726160490114\";\n/* 200x90, created 10/11/11 */\ngoogle_ad_slot = \"0121100435\";\ngoogle_ad_width = 200;\ngoogle_ad_height = 90;\n//-->\n\n\n\n<!--\ngoogle_ad_client = \"pub-7470726160490114\";\n/* 120x600, created 10/11/11 */\ngoogle_ad_slot = \"2704577959\";\ngoogle_ad_width = 120;\ngoogle_ad_height = 600;\n//-->\n\n\n\nReturn to top of page\nCopyright \u00a9 2013  \u00b7 Genesis Theme Framework by StudioPress\n"], ["Sweat Bees | Bee Friendly", "http://beefriendly.ca/sweat-bees/", "Sweat Bees on the North Shore\nSweat Bees belong to the large family of bees known as Halictidae of which we have, native to our area, members of the sub groups, Sweat Bees (Halictus), Metallic Green Bees (Agapostemon) and Orchid Bees (Lasioglosum). Sweat bees (Halctidae) are among the smallest of our many local bee species, averaging only 5 to 10mm in length, and get their common nickname from the habit of landing on people to collect the salt from our skin during hot summer weather. These little bees, like most bees, have the ability to defend themselves with small stingers which they will use if harmed or roughly handled. Sweat bees are excellent pollinators of many of the smaller flower type of native plants which are often bypassed by the larger bees.\nSweat bees (Halictus) are ground nesting bees that generally use vertical tunnels with side passages leading to egg chambers to rear their young. These shallow nesting sites are often accidentally destroyed by gardeners who are unaware of the presence of these native bees in their yards and gardens. Setting aside an area of sparsely covered, sandy soil in a sunny location will help provide a safe habitat to encourage these little pollinators to nest in your area.\nThe Green Sweat Bees (Agapostemon) are among the most strikingly noticeable of our native bee species with their metallic green or blue-green sheen and exotic mix of colors. These small bright green bees are a very solitary ground nesting sweat bee species that makes it\u2019s nests in separate locations and tends to each alone, unlike some of it\u2019s more communal (eusocial) relatives which sometimes share their nesting tunnels. The female green bees are fast fliers and have solid coloring while the males tend to fly more slowly while searching for females in the garden and have distinct stripes of different colors on their abdomens.\nOther native Sweat bees found on the North Shore are the dark metal green Orchid Bees, (Lasioglossum dialictus) and the dark green, almost black Orchid Bee, (Lasioglossum zonulum), both short range flyers that require nest habitat and forage sources to be within a few hundred yard area.These tiny generalist pollinators are commonly found in a wide range of habitats in large numbers due to their very communal nesting habits.

Tarantula hawks belong to any of the many species in the genera Pepsis and Hemipepsis in the family Pompilidae (spider wasps).\nThe more familiar species are up to 5\u00a0cm (2\u00a0in) long, with blue-black bodies and bright, rust-colored wings (other species have black wings with blue highlights), making them among the largest of wasps. The vivid coloration found on the bodies, and especially wings, of these wasps is an aposematism, advertising to potential predators the wasps' ability to deliver a powerful sting. Their long legs have hooked claws for grappling with their victims. The stinger of a female Pepsis grossa can be up to 7\u00a0mm (1/3\u00a0in) long, and the sting is considered the second most painful insect sting in the world.\n\n\nThe female tarantula hawk captures, stings, and paralyzes the spider, then either drags her prey back into her own burrow or transports it to a specially prepared nest, where a single egg is laid on the spider\u2019s abdomen, and the entrance is covered. When the wasp larva hatches, it creates a small hole in the spider's abdomen, then enters and feeds voraciously, avoiding vital organs for as long as possible to keep the spider alive. After several weeks, the larva pupates. Finally, the wasp becomes an adult, and emerges from the spider's abdomen to continue the life cycle. Tarantula wasps are also nectarivorous. The consumption of fermented fruit sometimes intoxicates them to the point that flight becomes difficult. While the wasps tend to be most active in daytime summer months, they tend to avoid high temperatures. The male tarantula hawk does not hunt; instead, it feeds off the flowers of milkweeds, western soapberry trees, or mesquite trees (females feed on these same plants, as well).[1] Male tarantula hawks have been observed practicing a behavior called hill-topping, in which they sit atop tall plants and watch for passing females ready to reproduce. Females are not very aggressive, in that they are hesitant to sting, but the sting is extraordinarily painful.\nWorldwide distribution of tarantula hawks includes areas from India to Southeast Asia, Africa, Australia, and the Americas. Tarantula hawk species have been observed from as far north as Goldendale, Washington in the United States, and south as far as Argentina in South America, with at least 250 species living in South America.[2] Several species of tarantula hawk are found in the deserts of the southwestern United States, with Pepsis grossa (formerly Pepsis formosa)[3] and Pepsis thisbe being common. The two species are difficult to distinguish, but the majority of P. grossa have metallic blue bodies and reddish antennae, which separates them from P. thisbe. Both species have bright orange wings that become transparent near the tip.\nThe tarantula hawk is relatively docile and rarely stings without provocation. However, the sting, particularly of P. grossa, is among the most painful of any insect, though the intense pain only lasts about three minutes.[4] Commenting on his own experience, Justin O. Schmidt, entomologist and creator of the Schmidt Sting Pain Index, described the pain as \"\u2026immediate, excruciating pain that simply shuts down one's ability to do anything, except, perhaps, scream. Mental discipline simply does not work in these situations.\"[2] In terms of scale, the wasp's sting is rated near the top of the Schmidt sting pain index, second only to that of the bullet ant, and is described by Schmidt as \"blinding, fierce [and] shockingly electric\".[5] Because of their extremely large stingers, very few animals are able to eat them; one of the few animals that can is the roadrunner. Many predatory animals avoid these wasps, and many different insects mimic them, including various other wasps and bees (Mullerian mimics), as well as moths, flies (e.g., mydas flies), and beetles (e.g., Tragidion) (Batesian mimics).\nThe U.S. state of New Mexico chose the tarantula hawk in 1989 to become its official state insect. Its selection was prompted by a group of Edgewood, New Mexico, elementary school children doing research on states that had adopted state insects. They selected three insects as candidates, and mailed ballots to all schools for a state-wide election. The winner was the tarantula hawk wasp (specifically, P. formosa).[6]"], ["Tarantula Hawk - photos - video - DesertUSA", "http://www.desertusa.com/insects/tarantula-hawks.html", "Southwest Adventure, Living & Travel\nFollow DesertUSA\nEnter E-Mail address:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nSeveral species of the wasps known as \"tarantula hawks\" inhabit the desert lands of the southwest. Pepsis formosa and Pepsis thisbe are probably the two most common. Wasps in the genus Hemipepsis are also known as \"tarantula hawks.\" The species are difficult to distinguish.\n\nDescription\n\nBody lengths measures up to two inches, and the wasps are rather robust, which provides good protection during encounters with tarantulas. The insects are metallic blue-black with wings that are blue-black, orangish or mahogany in color. This is another group of insects which, like velvet ants, have aposematic coloring \u0096 that is, conspicuous warning coloring \u0096 which warns potential predators that this is a meal that might be more painful that it is worth.\n\nRange\n\n  Pepsis is a New World genus, with species occurring from Argentina northward to Logan, Utah. Over 250 species are found in South America. Fifteen occur in the United States, with at least nine occurring in the deserts. Tarantula hawks occur wherever tarantulas are found. P. thisbe is the most northern ranging of the genus.\n\nPredator and Prey\n\n  Only a few animals, such as roadrunners, eat tarantula hawks. The wasps are \"nectivorous,\" and they have been known to become \"flight-challenged\" after consuming fermented fruit.\n\n    Habits and Habitat\n\n   Tarantula hawks are most active in the summer, during the day, although they avoid the highest temperatures. Females give the wasps their common name. Like all members of this genus, they require a spider to serve as host for their larvae, and in the case of the local species, tarantulas are the preferred nursery.\n\n  A female wasp finds a tarantula by smell. Generally, she scampers across the ground to locate a burrow. She will enter the burrow and expel the spider, then attack it. She may also encounter a male tarantula during his search for a mate. In an attack, the wasp uses her antennae to probe the spider, which may raise its front legs and bare its fangs. (A tarantula does not always counterattack.) She then attempts to sting the spider. She might seize the spider by a leg, flip it over on its back and sting it, or she may approach from the side to deliver a sting. Once stung, the tarantula becomes paralyzed within seconds. The condition will last for the remainder of its life. The wasp may drink the body fluids oozing from the spider\u2019s wounds or from its mouth to replenish nutrients and water she used during the attack.\n\nVideo of the Tarantula Hawk\n\n If the wasp expelled her victim, she will drag it back into its own burrow, now a burial vault, lay a single egg on the spider\u2019s abdomen, then seal the chamber. If the wasp succeeds in stinging a male tarantula on a mating hunt, she will excavate a burrow, drag the paralyzed spider inside, lay her single egg, and seal the chamber. \n\n\n\nOnce the egg hatches, the tiny grub, initially connected to the spider by the tip of its tail, bends over, attaches its head and begins to suck. It continues sucking until its final moult. It then rips open the spider's abdomen, thrusts its head and part of the thorax inside, and \"feeds ravenously,\" as one entomologist described it. As one might hope, even for a spider, the tarantula at this point is finally dead.\n\nMale tarantula wasps also lead an intriguing life. They engage in a behavior called \"hill-topping,\" where they perch on taller vegetation or high points. They are strongly territorial at these sites because of the good view of the surroundings and in particular, of newly emerged virgin females, which may be receptive to mating. Once again we see that males of another species act quite like males of our own species; think of males posted up at a bar keeping an eye on the door.\n\n    Notes\n\n  Tarantula hawk stings are considered to be the most painful of any North American insect. Christopher Starr wrote an article entitled, \"A Pain Scale for Bee, Wasp and Ant Stings.\" On a scale of one to four, Pepsis formosa was one of only two insects to rate a four. This compares with a one for a Solenopsis xyloni (desert fire ant), two for a Apis mellifera (honey bee) and three for a Dasymutilla klugii (velvet ant).\n\n  One researcher described the tarantula hawk\u2019s sting this way: \"To me, the pain is like an electric wand that hits you, inducing an immediate, excruciating pain that simply shuts down one\u2019s ability to do anything, except, perhaps, scream. Mental discipline simply does not work in these situations. The pain for me lasted only about three minutes, during which time the sting area was insensitive to touch, i.e., a pencil point poked near the sting resulted only in a dull deep pressure pain.\"\n\n  Tarantula wasps are unusual in the severity of their stings. Generally, it is the more social insects that deliver the most painful stings because they have a large nest to defend. Researchers hypothesize that the Pepsis as well as the Dasymutilla have evolved such painful stings because they spend so much time out in the open, exposed to potential predators.\n\n  Although painful, the Pepsis sting is not especially lethal. It rates a 38 on a lethal capacity scale. This compares with 5.9 for a Dasymutilla klugii, 54 for a Apis mellifera, and 200 for a Pogonomyrmex maricopa (a desert-dwelling seed-harvester ant).\n\n\nDavid B.

Their fear factor goes up when you consider that they they are able to eat larger animals like lizards, mice, and some small birds. However, most of the 900 species have venom weaker than a honeybee and don\u2019t really pose a risk to humans. Besides, if you think these spiders are scary, just imagine the kind of creature that preys on them.\nMeet the tarantula hawk:\n\n\u00a0\n\"Pepsis rubra, Female, side, GTMO, Cuba_2013-11-06-09.54.00 ZS PMax\" by USGS Bee Inventory and Monitoring Lab\nAdult tarantula hawks are fantastic pollinators and aren't typically aggressive. The males aren\u2019t even able to sting.\nThe female, on the other hand, is one badass bitch. Though she is pretty docile most of the time, she will strike when threatened. Her sting is described as one of the most severe out of any insect, and for about three minutes, the victim (even a human) completely loses the mental capacity for any other action other than reacting to the pain.\nSo where do the spiders fit in? Well, when a mommy and daddy tarantula hawk love each other very much\u00a0want to pass along their genes and come together to fertilize an egg, they want to make sure that it will be well taken care of, as they won\u2019t physically be present to ensure it survives. They need to find a host, and as the name implies, it's a tarantula. Because male spiders will typically forego eating in order to search for a mate, the wasps prefer to target well-fed females.\nWhen the female wasp is ready, she attacks. If all goes well, the wasp stings the spider, rendering it paralyzed for a few minutes but does not kill it. The fertilized egg is then deposited into the spider\u2019s abdomen so it will be kept safe and warm. A few days later, the larva emerges and begins to feed on the spider\u2019s juices. As it grows over the next 20 days, it continues to eat the still-living spider from the inside, but is careful not to eat vital organs which would kill the spider, meaning that the larva wouldn\u2019t have fresh food.\nThe tarantula isn\u2019t typically able to kill the wasp, because the wasp can just fly out of reach. At best, the spider just hopes to escape and fights fiercely, knowing it is a matter of life and death. Despite the wasp\u2019s advantage, the outcome of the encounter could go either way.\nWho do you think will win this round?\n\nView the discussion thread."], ["Tucson's Sadistic, Mostly Harmless Tarantula Hawk Wasps ...", "http://www.tucsonweekly.com/TheRange/archives/2014/07/09/tucsons-sadistic-mostly-harmless-tarantula-hawk-wasps-return-to-mesquites", "\nArchives | \r\n      RSS\n\n\nBlog Categories:\nPolitics |  \r\n      \r\n        News |  \r\n      \r\n        Music |  \r\n      \r\n        Chow |  \r\n      \r\n        Do This! |  \r\n      \r\n        Media |  \r\n      \r\n        Fun in General |  \r\n      \r\n        Sports |  \r\n      \r\n        TV |  \r\n      \r\n        Cinema |  \r\n      \r\n        Arts and Culture |  \r\n      \r\n        Weird Stuff |  \r\n      \r\n      more\u00a0categories\u00bb\n\n\nIt's that time of year again, when Tucsonans can see dozens of two-inched metallic midnight-blue or burnt-sienna creatures scampering under our mesquite trees in a methed-out manner, as if perpetually looking for an imaginary missing lighter. They are the Pepsis and Hemipepsis  wasps, aka the tarantula hawk, which normally come out of hiding in July, and can be found mid-day just before and after a monsoon rain as they sniff out possible tarantula burrows amongst the mesquite's fallen bean pods. \nPhoto courtesty of mtrb.com\nAccording to a report by Dawn H. Gouge and Carl Olson of the UA Department of Entomology, the tarantula wasp has the most painful sting in North America, second in the world only to Central and South America\u2019s bullet ant, which earns top ranking on the Schmidt Sting Pain Index. The wasp's sting has been described as something close to sitting in a tub of water and throwing in a toaster oven\u2014blinding and debilitating, leaving the victim a screaming, balled-up hot mess. \nAfter only a few minutes, however, the excruciating pain usually subsides, and the tiny sting resembles that of a fire ant. You pretty much have to purposely pick the wasp up in order to get stung, as they mostly ignore humans. It\u2019s our velvety eight-legged friends that need to beware, for its fate shall be a slow and grisly one as the female tarantula hawk uses the spider as a host for its larvae.\nDavid B. Williams at Desert USA gets into the morbid details:\n Once stung, the tarantula becomes paralyzed within seconds. The condition will last for the remainder of its life. The wasp may drink the body fluids oozing from the spider\u2019s wounds or from its mouth to replenish nutrients and water she used during the attack.\nIf the wasp expelled her victim, she will drag it back into its own burrow, now a burial vault, lay a single egg on the spider\u2019s abdomen, then seal the chamber. If the wasp succeeds in stinging a male tarantula on a mating hunt, she will excavate a burrow, drag the paralyzed spider inside, lay her single egg, and seal the chamber. \nOnce the egg hatches, the tiny grub, initially connected to the spider by the tip of its tail, bends over, attaches its head and begins to suck. It continues sucking until its final moult. It then rips open the spider's abdomen, thrusts its head and part of the thorax inside, and \"feeds ravenously,\" as one entomologist described it. As one might hope, even for a spider, the tarantula at this point is finally dead.\nJAMES HUDSONAs close as I wanted to get to this tarantula hawk cruising Downtown Tucson yesterday evening.\nGene Hall, who is Museum Manager at the UA Entomology Museum's Insect Collection, said of the tarantula hawk, \"They are one of the beautiful gentle giants of the desert fauna.

The journey can be long, arduous, and deadly. Many tarantulas are run over by cars as they cross roadways or are eaten by predators before they ever find a partner. When the male tarantula detects a female, he cautiously approaches the entrance to the female's burrow. Once at the entrance he taps his foot to alert the female to his presence. If the female is receptive, she cautiously emerges from her den. If the female tarantula is hungry or has already mated, she is just as likely to make the male tarantula her next meal as she is to make him her mate.  Even if the male tarantula is able to leave the female's burrow unscathed, he will wander off and eventually die.\nPrintable Tarantula Fact Sheet (PDF)\nThe female tarantula hawk searches for the burrow of an unsuspecting tarantula.\nNPS Photo by Sally King\n\n\t\t\t\tMule deer fawns only keep their spots for the first several months of life.

Initiated by Edgewood, New Mexico elementary school students doing research on states which had already adopted insect symbols, they selected three insects as candidates and mailed ballots to all New Mexico schools for a state-wide election. As part of the project, the entire class attended the legislative hearing in Santa Fe when the bill was introduced.\nThese huge wasps (the largest wasps in the United States - up to two inches long) feed on nectar, but procreate in a particularly morbid fashion (the basis for their name). When a female is ready to lay her eggs, she seeks out a tarantula and injects it with paralyzing venom. She drags the tarantula to a burrow and stuffs it down the hole, then lays her eggs on top of the paralyzed spider. Several days later the eggs hatch and the larvae feed on the still living tarantula.\nSeveral species of wasps known as \"tarantula hawks\" inhabit the deserts of the southwest that build nests in the ground and provide their young with spiders for food (Pepsis formosa and Pepsis thisbe are probably the two most common). The majority of these wasps have metallic blue bodies with fiery red or orange wings, and long legs ending in hooked claws.\nOnly a few animals, such as roadrunners (New Mexico's state bird), eat tarantula hawk wasps. Tarantula hawk stings are considered to be one of the most painful insect stings in the world (the stinger of a female tarantula hawk can be up to 1/3 inch long).\n\n\n\nbird - animal\nreptile - insect\namphibian - fish\nflower - grass\nfossil - gem\nbutterfly - tree - soil\nvegetables\ncookie - quarter\n\nflag - seal\nmotto / slogan\nname - nickname\ntie - tartans\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmuseum\naircraft\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpoem - colors\nsong 1-2-3-4-5\n\u00a0\n\n\n<!--\ngoogle_ad_client = \"ca-pub-9351325408399104\";\n/* 300x250, created 8/26/10 */\ngoogle_ad_slot = \"7932915756\";\ngoogle_ad_width = 300;\ngoogle_ad_height = 250;\n//-->\n\n\n\n\n\n<!--\ngoogle_ad_client = \"ca-pub-9351325408399104\";\n/* 300x250, created 8/26/10 */\ngoogle_ad_slot = \"7932915756\";\ngoogle_ad_width = 300;\ngoogle_ad_height = 250;\n//-->\n\n\n\n\nTweets by @StateSymbolsUSA\n!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+\"://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");\n\n\n\nSee more state insect videos\n\n\u00a0home | about | donations | contact | copyright | privacy | gifts | sitemap"], ["10 largest insects: Tarantula hawk - Mother Nature Network", "http://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/animals/photos/10-of-the-largest-insects-in-the-world/tarantula-hawk", "\u00a0\nView the discussion thread.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2014 MNN HOLDING COMPANY, LLC.

They have a blue to black robust body which provides elusiveness and protection from their prey, the tarantula.\r  Tarantula Hawk wings range from blue-black to red, orange, or mahogany in color. The coloring of the wings provides warning to potential predators of the Tarantula Hawk. This type of warning\r  coloration is referred to as aposematic coloring. At the end of the wasp's legs they have hooked claws used for attaching themselves to other insects or plants and also for grappling with other\r  insects. Female Tarantula Hawks have a stinger that can be up to 7 mm long and provides one of the most painful stings of any insect.\nNatural History\nLife Cycle\nAdult male Tarantula Hawks will exhibit \"hill-topping\", in which they will reside on tall plants in search of females ready to copulate. Once impregnated, the female tarantula hawk will lay a\r  single egg on the abdomen of a tarantula. This egg will then develop into a larva, which feeds on the immobile spider. This larva will then mature into its adult form and repeat the process.\nHabitat\nTarantula Hawks will reside where tarantulas are found, which is in dry, warm climates such as in the Southwest. They are also found in rainforests. (Tarantula hawks are also most active during\r  the summer, but they seek shelter during extreme heat.)\nBehavior\nTypical behavior of the tarantula hawk is non-aggressive. They are nectar-feeding insects that only exhibit aggression when the females need to immobilize a tarantula to lay her eggs. The female\r  tarantula hawks will seek out either wandering tarantulas or invade burrows. The wasp provokes the tarantula into raising its body so that the wasp can sting the tarantula's abdomen, immediately\r  causing paralysis to the tarantula. Another means of attack is to try to flip over the tarantula by grabbing its leg and then stinging its abdomen. It will then drag the body to its nesting burrow.\r  One egg is laid on the abdomen of the spider. Once a larva, it will eat the tissues of the spider, while avoiding organs so as to preserve freshness. Typically these spider wasps are most active\r  during the day, avoiding high temperatures.\nDistribution\nTarantula Hawks have been found throughout southern North America south to Argentina. In North America, these wasps are found mainly populating the desert regions. Over this range, at least 250\r  different species are recorded\nReferences\nBurnie, D. 2000.

The head has mouthparts modified into a tongue-like structure, large eyes, and \r\nlarge antennae. The thorax has four red orange membranous wings, and long strong legs. There is a narrow \r\nconnection between the thorax and abdomen. The abdomen of the female has a sting, which evolved from an \r\negg laying organ.\nGeographic range:\nThe tarantula hawk wasp is found across most of the Southwest down \r\ninto Mexico.\nHabitat:\nThe tarantula hawk wasp is found in a variety of desert habitats such as \r\nshrub lands, grasslands, and arroyos. They are often seen around flowers or running around on the \r\nground.\nFood Web:\nThe adult feeds on nectar found in the flowers from a variety of desert \r\nplants. The larva feed on a tarantula that the female has paralyzed and provided.\nReproduction and Development:Mating occurs around flowers where the males and \r\nfemales feed. The eggs are deposited on a paralyzed tarantula that the female has stung and placed in a \r\nburrow. The grub-like larva feed on the tarantula. They next spin a golden colored cocoon around themselves \r\nand go into a resting stage. They emerge from this resting stage as adults.\nBehavior:The tarantula hawk wasp is diurnal, but its prey is nocturnal; so most \r\nhunting occurs at dusk. During the day they spend most of their time feeding around flowers. After mating \r\nthe female will search for a tarantula. This may involve finding a roaming male tarantula or a tarantula'sburrow. The female locates the tarantula burrows by using her sense of smell as she runs around on the \r\nground. When a burrow is found she will sometimes touch the silk around the burrow entrance to entice the \r\ntarantula to come out of the burrow. The female must now sting the tarantula between the legs on the \r\nunderside of the spider. She may use the tarantula's burrow or drag the paralyzed tarantula to a burrow she \r\nhas made. She will next deposit eggs on the tarantula. The female may also use the venom in the sting as a \r\ndefensive weapon.\nEcosystem roles:The adults feed on nectar and in the process help pollinate the \r\nplants they visit. The female is one of the predators of tarantulas. Predators that can catch them also \r\nprey upon the tarantula hawk wasps.\nTaxonomy:\nKingdom: Animalia\nPhylum: Arthropoda\nSubphylum: Atelocerata\nClass: Hexapoda\nOrder: Hymenoptera\nFamily: Pompillidae\nGenus: Pepsis\nSpecies: Pepsis chrysthemis\nReferences:Borror, Donald J. and Richard E.

Adult tarantula hawks are not carnivorous, but drink nectar just as honey bees do. But when a female tarantula hawk is ready to lay an egg, she must find a tarantula, sting it (with one of the most potent stings of any North American insect) and drag the paralyzed spider to its burrow, as shown in this photograph. The wasp will then lay a single egg on the spider, which will soon hatch into a maggot-like larva. The larva will feed on the still-living, but paralyzed tarantula for about a month. The adult wasp will emerge from the burrow the following season. Tarantula hawks may look intimidating, but are generally mild-mannered towards humans. Nonetheless, one should never attempt to pick up or molest a tarantula hawk as the sting is extraordinarily painful! \nTarantula hawks of a variety of species can be found almost anywhere in San Diego County, from the coastal plain to the foothills to the mountains to the desert. They are widespread throughout the San Dieguito River Park. Their only requirements are flowers for the adults to feed at and tarantulas for the young to feed on. \nText and Photo  by Robyn Waayers.

It inhabits humid lowland rainforests from Nicaragua and the extreme east of Honduras south to Paraguay. The bullet ant is called hormiga veinticuatro or \"24 (hour) ant\" by the locals, referring to the 24 hours of pain that follow being stung.[2] The species epithet clavata means \"club-shaped\".\n\n\nWorker ants are 18\u201330 millimetres (0.7\u20131.2\u00a0in) long[3] and resemble stout, reddish-black, wingless wasps. Paraponera is predatory, and like all primitive poneromorphs, does not display polymorphism in the worker caste; the queen ant is not much larger than the workers.[4]\nThe pain caused by this insect's sting is purported to be greater than that of any other hymenopteran, and is ranked as the most painful according to the Schmidt sting pain index, given a \"4+\" rating, above the tarantula hawk wasp and, according to some victims, equal to being shot, hence the name of the insect. It is described as causing \"waves of burning, throbbing, all-consuming pain that continues unabated for up to 24 hours\". The ant is thought to have evolved its sting to ward off any predators that would normally unearth them.[2] Poneratoxin, a paralyzing neurotoxic peptide isolated from the venom, affects voltage-dependent sodium ion channels and blocks the synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. It is being investigated for possible medical applications.[5][6]\nThe Satere-Mawe people of Brazil use intentional bullet ant stings as part of their initiation rites to become a warrior.[7] The ants are first rendered unconscious by submerging them in a natural sedative, and then hundreds of them are woven into a glove made of leaves (which resembles a large oven mitt), stingers facing inward. When the ants regain consciousness, a boy slips the glove onto his hand. The goal of this initiation rite is to keep the glove on for a full 10 minutes. When finished, the boy's hand and part of his arm are temporarily paralyzed because of the ant venom, and he may shake uncontrollably for days. The only \"protection\" provided is a coating of charcoal on the hands, supposedly to confuse the ants and inhibit their stinging. To fully complete the initiation, however, the boys must go through the ordeal a total of 20 times over the course of several months or even years.[8]\nColonies consist of several hundred individuals and are usually situated at the bases of trees. Workers forage arboreally in the area directly above the nest for small arthropods and nectar, often as far as the upper canopy; little foraging occurs on the forest floor. Nectar, carried between the mandibles, is the most common food taken back to the nest by foragers. Two studies in Costa Rica and on Barro Colorado Island (BCI) found about four bullet ant nests per hectare of forest. On BCI, the nests were found under 70 species of trees, six species of shrubs, two species of lianas and one species of palm. Nests were most common beneath the canopies of Faramea occidentalis and Trichilia tuberculata, but these trees are also the most abundant in the forest. Nests were present more frequently than would be expected based on the abundance of the trees under Alseis blackiana, Tabernaemontana arborea, Virola sebifera, Guaria guidonia and Oecocarpus mapoura. The large number of nest plants suggests little active selection of nest sites by bullet ants. Small shrubs, however, are underused, probably because they do not provide access to the forest canopy. The study on BCI concluded trees with buttresses and extrafloral nectaries may be selected for by bullet ants.[9]\nThe small (1.5\u2013 to 2.0-mm-long) phorid fly, Apocephalus paraponerae, is a parasite of injured workers of P. clavata, of which the supply is constant because frequent aggressive encounters occur between neighbouring colonies, resulting in maimed workers. They are able to parasitise healthy ants if they are artificially restrained, but this is thought to be rare in practice, as healthy ants are agile and able to repel the flies. Both male and female flies are attracted by the scent of injured ants; the females lay eggs, as well as feed, and the males feed and possibly mate with the females. The flies are attracted to a crushed ant within two to three minutes and 10 or more flies may be attracted to each ant. Each ant can harbour 20 fly larvae. Carl Rettenmeyer observed P. clavata actively trying to attack A. paraponerae when they approached the entrance to their nest.[3][10]"], ["Paraponera - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraponera", "Paraponera is a genus of ants in the subfamily Paraponerinae.[2] It is the only genus in the subfamily and consists of two species: the extant Paraponera clavata, also known as a bullet ant, found in the Neotropics, and the very small[3] fossil species Paraponera dieteri known from Dominican amber (Early Miocene; 16-19 million years ago).[4]\n"], ["bullet ant - Why Evolution Is True - WordPress.com", "http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2014/08/06/the-worst-pain-known-to-humans-the-bullet-ant-gloves-of-brazil/", "Parponera clavata is known as the \u201cbullet ant\u201d because of the intense pain it inflicts with its stings.

Somebody is using a drill to excavate your ingrown toenail.\nAnimal: Paper wasp\u2028\nSchmidt Index: 3.0\n\u2028Description: Caustic and burning. Distinctly bitter aftertaste. Like spilling a beaker of hydrochloric acid on a paper cut.\nAnimal: Tarantula hawk\u2028\nSchmidt Index: 4.0\n\u2028Description: Blinding, fierce, shockingly electric. A running hair drier has been dropped into your bubble bath.\nAnimal: Bullet ant\u2028\nSchmidt Index: 4.0+\u2028\nDescription: Pure, intense, brilliant pain. Like fire-walking over flaming charcoal with a 3-inch rusty nail grinding into your heel.\nAnd in any of these scenarios\u2026if you are allergic. Perhaps death. Honey Bees can kill me, so I\u2019d put those at the top of the list.\nI know this is a pain index\u2026just aquating pain to death. apples/oranges\u2026drrr\nMostly I don\u2019t understand modern poetry, but sometimes someone gets it just right. Apparently that version is a loose collaboration between Schmidt and someone (unnamed) at Outside magazine in 1996, but it\u2019s a thing of beauty.\nThe sweat bees I know in northern Australia don\u2019t sting at all as far as I can tell (level 0 or n/a), and are probably phylogenetically distant from the ones Schmidt rated.\nA large spider-killer wasp (presumably comparable to the tarantula hawk mentioned under level 4 in the link above) got me once, and I compared it to being hit with a hammer. There was also momentary retrograde amnesia, as I\u2019d been slowly moving my hand towards it (it was immobile under a rock I turned over, and I thought it was probably dead) but couldn\u2019t recall getting closer than a couple of inches. \nPersonally, I\u2019d think about using separate scales for onset, peak intensity and duration. I\u2019ll try to get hold of more of the literature (not much is open access, but this one\u2018s good), and see if there\u2019s anything useful to say about elapid snakebites, which I\u2019ve sampled a bit. On the Schmidt/Starr scale based on immediate pain, I doubt that any snake goes above level 2. Some of them kill with no pain at all.\nAs is so often the case, substitute \u201cmanliness\u201d for \u201cstupidity\u201d. Trouble is, I can remember a time when I might have had a go myself. :-)\nUh! Not only would I not put the gloves on, I\u2019d run the other way screaming!\nThat makes two of us!\nThree\nGlad I\u2019ll never have to prove my manhood.\nI\u2019ve found there are much more enjoyable ways to do that ;).\nA nod\u2019s as good as a wink to a blind bat\u2026.\nThree glad???  What was my iPad thinking?  I meant very glad..Was it on here that I saw the comment \u201cAutocorrect has become my worst enema\u201d?\nI thought you were just adding yourself onto the list after missironfistatheist.  Like the autocorrect quote :).\nWhoops \u2013 maybe that IS what I meant\u2026.I can still damn autocorrect gratuitously just on principle;-)\n :) :)\nSmall correction, it\u2019s Paraponera, not Parponera. I\u2019m sure your finger just slipped.\nI\u2019ve seen some of Hamish comedy programs and while, in my opinion, this was inmensely stupid, it was also the funniest thing i\u2019ve seen him do :P\nCan evolution be somewhat involved here?  Presumably, passing (surviving) the manhood test will have a bearing on getting a spouse and status in the community.  The current population is likely descended from those most immune to the toxin.  This could explain why tribal members can bear the pain, while outsiders are totally debilitated.\nJust what I was thinking. Do we know how long this tradition has existed, and how often it is fatal?\nditto\nDarwin Award candidates?  As fate would have it, I have a date with a hornet\u2019s nest tonight.  Full body armor for me.\nI was thinking that the tribesmen could have some more tolerance b/c they had been stung once or twice before, as kids playing in the woods. But I am sure that also being very stoic and not showing pain at any cost is also a big factor.\nDon\u2019t know if it is common, but my allergies to honey bees became worse each time I was stung. No tolerance here.\nThe Schmidt pain index, at least the version \u201cwheedled\u201d out of Schmidt by some popular magazine (whose name I forget) is a work of art by itself, with descriptions of the pain parodying the pretentious vocabulary of wine tasting reviews.  For example, the bullet ant is described as producing a \u201cpure, intense and brilliant\u201d pain, while the sweat bee produces one that is \u201clight, ephemeral, almost fruity\u201d.\nIt\u2019s possible that the Satere-Mawe are having some fun at the filmmakers\u2019 expense. Maybe the glove for their tribesmen are not quite the same as those for the gawkers. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time something like that happened.\nTarantula hawk wasp\u2026state insect of New Mexico.  I just found two of them in my yard.  They have a commanding presence, like \u201cStay the hell away or you die slowly and painfully while I walk, not fly, away.\u201d\nThey are gorgeous, impressive and extraordinarily terrifying. Our common wasps make me uneasy and get my adrenalin pumping if they get too close\u2026one of those giants  in my yard would make me move away to another part of the country.\nYes, I have seen a few of them while living in the west. They are not aggressive, thank ceiling cat. I did consider letting one crawl on me (b/c I used to like to do lost of stupid things like that). Now, I am glad I did not.\nI think regular wasps say, \u201cI\u2019ll get buddies & we\u2019ll sting you all at once & kill ya!\u201d\nThose are the kind that hang out in our garden. When they do that to me, ah, the pain is like being injected briefly with acid then vinegar and finally strong mouthwash. Thankfully it last only minutes.\nScary video of tarantula hawk wasp vs tarantula\nFascinating, but ickyissimo!  Nothing like Scylla and Charibides\u2026\nI wonder if the Amazonian tribe that practices the ritual has developed somewhat of a tolerance to the stings. \nMy grandfather raised bees and though my father would don protective clothing when handling the bees to avoid being stung, my grandfather wouldn\u2019t bother finding the gear more inconvenient than the bee stings which he described as mild pricks.\nNever heard of bullet-ants\u2026thanks for the post. These right of passage rituals are fascinating. How about those people in India who rub ghost peppers in their eyes? Yikes!\nGhost peppers in the eyes? Yeesh. But they eat a lot of spicy food, so maybe it is only excruciating.\nPZ just posted about a guy in the UK who regrets putting popping candy under his foreskin.  The rituals people from strange cultures will perform!\nI was having such a good time in here, then I read \u201cPZ just posted\u201d.\nFunnym, I was having such a good time in here, then I read \u201cputting popping candy under his foreskin\u201d.\nputting popping candy under his foreskin\nI know people who would think that a good start to the evening. At least, if \u201cpopping candy\u201d is the sort of confectionery that I think it is. If it\u2019s not \u2026 that could get very weird.\nI dunno Jerry\u2026 you have inflicted a lot of Sofistikated Theology upon yourself over the years, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll never forget that pain either.\nI often wonder how Jerry manages to endure the pain of reading the nutcase and wacko mail.  Would repeated exposure desensitize a person or amplify the pain.\nI wonder how some of that stuff would score on the Schmidt sting pain index\u2026.\nTheologian: Alvin Plantinga\nSchmidt Index: 3.5\nDescription: A gooey, pungent sort of pain. Like placing your face on a George Foreman grill.\nThe repeated exposures must build some kind of tolerance, right? Otherwise it\u2019s hard to imagine anyone going through this 20 TIMES.\nAnd this may be considered an \u201cinitiation ritual\u201d now, but it may have actually had a purpose at some point. If tribes in this area go to war, those ants would make an effective weapon. In order to become a warrior you\u2019d have to desensitize yourself in advance, or else experience it in battle with fatal consequences.\nThe different texts move back and forth between \u201cstings\u201d and \u201cbites.\u201d  I always thought that ants bit and formic acid got into the wound (hence the family name Formicidae).  Can someone clarify?  My class in entomology was in 1971.  Thanks.\nBoth are correct. Some genera have stingers (e.g. Solenopsis), while others don\u2019t and instead have an apparatus that sprays the chemicals (e.g. Formica). Those can bite and then spray the wound. Generally speaking, unless i\u2019m mistaken, the ones with stingers tend to be significantly worse.\nI\u2019d like to know that too. It looks like it has a little stinger on its rear end. I once had someone tell me that there is a difference between a wasp sting and a wasp bite, but when I looked into it, entomologists said that wasps never bite as a defensive measure. If you get pricked by a wasp, it\u2019s definitely a sting and not a bite. Maybe ants are the same? I don\u2019t know.\n\u201cPoneratoxin, a paralyzing neurotoxic peptide isolated from the venom, affects voltage-dependent sodium ion channels and blocks the synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. It is being investigated for possible medical applications.\u201d\n___\nHow many other medical applications are never discovered because of species extinction?\nGot to wonder (did not watch the vid) if the \u2018glove\u2019 is woven by the lad\u2019s mom.\nAnd does the bullet ant need to be so beautiful? :-(\nAre there any societies that have these sort of rituals for their women? By that I mean undergoing great pain or risk as an initiation ritual.\nPerhaps childbirth is the female equivalent.\nI\u2019ve heard of a southern African tribe where part of the initiation to be an elite warrior is to remain flaccid in the presence of a woman dancing naked after being alone in the bush for a while. That\u2019s probably quite risky for the woman.\nWouldn\u2019t that just be an indication that he\u2019s gay?\nLike this?\n\nI have been told by a brother-in-law who works in an emergency room that women who have experienced the passing of a kidney stone tell him that it is roughly equivalent to childbirth in severity of pain.  Having passed a kidney stone a couple of months ago \u2013 well, it wasn\u2019t fun.\nI\u2019d heard several horror stories and people would screw up their faces and act very sympathetic. When it was my turn the pain from having stones in my kidney was worse than actually passing them, which was eased by taking medication that partly dissolved and weakened the structure of the stones, breaking them up and making them easier to pass. But it was not a fun time in my life. :-(\nScience-based medicine: http://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/kidneystones_ShockWave.cfm\nMy last serious stone incident (about eight years ago) ended with laser lithotripsy, in which they threaded a fiber-optic laser through my urethra and bladder to where the stone was lodged in my ureter. (Fortunately I was unconscious during this procedure.) Because of its position near my pelvis they couldn\u2019t pinpoint the stone accurately enough for external shock-wave lithotripsy.\nBest advice for people prone to stone formation: stay hydrated, limit your coffee intake (oxalic acid contributes to stone growth), learn to recognize the early sensations of stone formation, and titrate your urinary pH with daily doses of strong lemonade to shrink any stones that do form.\nDue to my weight I wasn\u2019t a candidate for this. I\u2019ve read that apple juice (I was an addict) can be a factor. I continue to take the appropriate medication to (hopefully) prevent stones from re-forming.\nWell this is just great \u2013 I had coffee this morning and I just heated up some apple cider.  Should I hop in the car and head for the hospital right now?\nBlack coffee two or three times a week hasn\u2019t been a problem for me \u2014 so long as I remain alert to those internal symptoms.  Lattes (calcium + oxalic acid) are definitely not on, however.\n{Replying to Gregory] My father had a kidney stone years ago.  The experience was so traumatic that he cut way back on his dairy intake.  He is now osteopenic and will be on meds for that for the rest of his life.\nFemale circumcision and other scarring rituals would be the closest equivalent. I had a prof in college who said that in some tribes, a girl\u2019s first period is considered her \u201cinitiation\u201d into womanhood\u2013she\u2019s showing that she\u2019s an adult by shedding blood.\nAren\u2019t first periods considered the same kind of thing in the West?\nHis point, which I realize I didn\u2019t make clear, is that the tribes don\u2019t put the girls through an blood-letting initiation ceremony because nature provides one.\nMakes sense.\nThat is the only ant I have seen more menacing than mutant alien ants in various horror films.\nHope the CIA doesn\u2019t learn about these ants\u2026.\nYeah\u2026and we thought water-boarding was bad!\nObama will have to say, \u201cwe stung some folks\u201d.\nThat sound bite will, ahem, bite him. But it\u2019s sad that this guy can\u2019t even smile without ridicule. The hate for our President is abhorrent.\nDiana\u2026not saying you hate him\u2026should have been more clear on that.\nNo worries, I realized you weren\u2019t implying I hate him.\nI agree.  The disrespect is appalling (I\u2019m also not declaring Diana to be in this camp.)  Though one out two of the haters unintentionally outed themselves but saying something like \u201d i wanted to see him fail from the moment he took the oath of office\u2026\u201d   So tell me, what did you know about him at that point except for, um, skin color.\nThe worst thing is that the hate is so massive that when Mr. Obama does something I think should be criticized, it isn\u2019t possible to have a serious, balanced convetsation about it.\nWhen I was watching the news about bin Laden being killed, I said, \u201cThe Republicans must be wracking their brains, trying to figure out how to use this AGAINST Obama.\u201d I was right; conservatives were soon saying that bin Laden wasn\u2019t really THAT important, that Obama waited too long to launch the attack, that Obama should have waited several days before making the announcement that bin Laden was dead, that it was Obama\u2019s fault that a helicopter crashed, etc. They obviously were incapable of giving him credit for ANYTHING. It reminded me of the old joke: if he walked on water, they\u2019d say \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Can\u2019t he swim?\u201d\nIt is truly appalling how he\u2019s been treated.  The hatred of Obama by so many is so visceral that no rational discussion is possible.  These people can\u2019t admit they\u2019re motivated by racism so they have to rationalize like crazy.\nThere is a mention here of gated sodium channels. There is a gene called SCN11A that encodes a voltage-gated sodium channel. Activating mutations in this gene cause familial episodic pain syndromes (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24207120). I wonder if these guys have a downregulation of that gene that allows them to at least partially resist the pain. The natives certainly seemed to be suffering less than the visitors.\nUsually, it gets worse when the gloves come off\u2026\nAll this sort of tribal nonsense will soon be eradicated from this world and will go in the way of other tribal customs that no longer exist such as Aztec human (child) sacrifice. This will happen as slowly the whole world becomes civilised, even Afghanistan! How? By the spread of reason.\nYou really think so? Bull Fighting, which as a method of inflicting ritual pain does not seem to be much better, goes on in several regions of the world that would be considered \u201ccivilized\u201d by any standards.\nAnd is not likely to last for much longer\u2026\nHere in Spain, the attitudes towards it are shifting quickly and it may be a matter of a few years before significant changes are made or it even disappears. It\u2019s already banned in one region\u2026\nBull fighting also survives in Tamil Nadu in India.  What makes things even more ironic is that by any standards, Tamil Nadu is among the most \u201cdeveloped\u201d Indian states, with various economic and social indicators matching with the best in the world, and also one of the most economically prosperous.  Yet, bull fighting survives despite court orders and animal rights activism.  The saving grace is that unlike the Spanish version, the bull is not killed, but people still die occasionally.\n\u201cSaving grace..\u201d seems a bit strong. The version in India does not give the humans any weapons as far as I am aware, the bull is not constantly stabbed or slowly bled to death. That is a world of difference, not a tiny matter of death at the end as your statement (at least to me) implies. This is basically, especially after looking at some quick youtube videos, like American and Canadian rodeos. I think it would be hard to say if the bull undergoes any serious physical or emotional trauma here, it seems to be on the same level as pack animals (in fact less because the bulls have an awesome life the rest of the time, they hardly undergo backbreaking exertion). The only ones with real risk for  trauma are the humans here. Funnily this activity matches activities in the US and Canada (very civilized places) like the other indicators you point out, so maybe Tamil Nadu really is becoming more \u201ccivilized\u201d.\nI think the larger point is that cruelty to animals has become progressively less tolerated over history. Pinker covers this extensively in his Better Angels book.\nYes I agree with that point which is why I think this a bad example as it doesn\u2019t seem to display any cruelty to animals. And it hasn\u2019t displayed cruelty to animals  historically, especially for cows in this part of the world, and so has little do with Pinker\u2019s point, if anything its a counterpoint or exception. Anyway getting a bit too pedantic, that\u2019ll be the last I\u2019ll post on this.\nHmm, not sure I share your optimism.\nIf you ever see a hen or stag do here in the UK, these are a) not very civilised, but more importantly, b) also lead to excruciating hangovers that last up to 24 hours.\nThey are also considered by some to be an initiation ritual where you show you\u2019re an adult by inflicting and tolerating the pain.\nPlus \u00e7a change\u2026\nNot having the experience of either one of these ants, or of passing a kidney stone, I don\u2019t know how they compare. But I\u2019ve had a colleague who started passing a kidney stone during a fogged-in spell on a rig, and it took 3 days before he could get to shore for some proper medication. I\u2019ve frequently heard of that as being the worst pain in the world.\nIt\u2019s not that bad. I wouldn\u2019t wish it on my worst enemy, but I think the Bullet Ant would be far far worse.\nsee my comment to #18.  The kidney stone is vry painful, the guy in the bullet ant video looks like he had it quite a bit worse.\nI\u2019ve passed kidney stones. It felt like I was passing a red-hot ball-bearing, and I made Ralph Kramden noises while it was happening: \u201cOOOOOHwoooahooooh!\u201d Once it was out, though, there was no pain, but everyone\u2019s experience is different.\nI was giving my medical history to a woman from an insurance company and mentioned that I had had kidney stones. She asked if I needed surgery; when I told her I passed them, she matter-of-factly said, \u201cSo you know what it\u2019s like to give birth.\u201d\nAs David Duncan says above, the pain from having them was excrutiating; passing them was over in a couple of seconds.  You\u2019ll definitely know you\u2019re passing them though.\nHmmm, St******* was stuck with his for 3 days (no helicopters because of fog ; no transfer to boats because of sea state) and described it in \u201cI don\u2019t have words\u201d words. But no doubt individuals (the stones) differ.\nNow just imagine a bullet ant passing through your kidneys\u2026\nLucky he didn\u2019t lose a finger. Shows how much thought he put into this, he didn\u2019t even take the precaution of taking off his ring\nHe wasn\u2019t wearing a ring during the glove incident, nor in hospital, nor I think, as it\u2019s not very clear in the photo, later in the restaurant.\nI suspect those are not his swollen hands.\nLol, Hamish and Andy are not documentary makers! https://m.facebook.com/hamishandandy?_rdr\nJust to point out that Hamish Blake (and his colleague, Andy Lee) are comedians, not documentary makers. They have made several popular series for Australian television where they travel to various parts of the world and do various silly (and supposedly entertaining) stunts like this.

The pain of their stingers is 30 times worse than a bee or wasp sting. Certainly enough to take your breath away.\nCurious about the bullet ant and why its name sounds so dangerous? It is said that getting stung by one of these little guys is like getting shot by a bullet. The bullet ant is distinguished from other ants by its harsh sting and large size. It is the largest type of ant in the world. It can grow up to an inch in length and is typically either red or brown in color. The bullet ant likes to nest at the bases of trees. It is also known as the 24-hour ant because the pain from the sting is said to last 24 hours.\nThis scary critter derives its name from its sting, which has been proven to be \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe most painful sting out of all the invertebrates in the world. Imagine getting stung by a big, ugly wasp and think of the pain it brings. Now imagine a sting 30 times more painful. This is the equivalent of the bullet ant's sting. In fact, the Schmidt Sting Index describes it as similar to \u201cfire-walking over charcoal with a 3-inch rusty nail in your heel.\u201d I definitely would not want to be around this insect when it gets mad.\nSome tribes in the Amazon have an interesting ritual for the males of their societies. Adolescent boys go through a rite of passage into adulthood that involves bullet ants. They are stung by hundreds of these painful insects in order to prove their manhood. A young man must stick his hands into gloves that contain a couple hundred bullet ants. He must keep his hands in the gloves for at least ten minutes. \nYou may be wondering who would willingly handle the bullet ants to place them into the gloves, considering they are more painful than root canal. The ants are found among trees, and great care is used when picking them up. The tribe's medicine man drugs the ants to temporarily allow them to doze off. While they are dazed, he places them into the gloves, ensuring that the stingers are facing the inside layers of the gloves. The medicine man also helps the initiates by dancing with them during the ritual as a distraction to their pain.\nDuring the ten minute ritual, a young man feels sharp pricking from the stingers, but nothing too painful. However, the aftereffects of the stings are far worse. The venom shoots quickly through the blood of the body and into the muscles. The muscles become extremely weak, the entire body shakes, the lips swell and the eyelids begin to droop. The young man sweats profusely and drools uncontrollably. He will not be aware of his surroundings and may become very confused. These effects can last as long as 3 hours.\nAfter the worst part is over, the pain still does not subside. The young man's hands swell two or three times their normal size and remain swollen for at least another twelve hours. The sharp pains continue to come and go. The effects of the bullet ants will not fully dissipate until 24 hours after being stung. If a young man can handle physical pain induced by bullet ants, it is felt he will certainly be capable of handling anything. Some tribes even require men to commit to this ritual not just once, but 20 times before becoming a tribe warrior. I'd rather go to the marines for my training, thank you.\nThe toxin the bullet ant gives off from its stinger causes all of these effects. This toxin is called poneratoxin which causes slow, but harsh contractions of muscles. After being stung by a bullet ant, animals have no control over relaxing or contracting their muscles. They can only wait until the venom wears off and for their bodies to return to a normal state.\nTribal peoples of Central America also use bullet ants in their cultures. They can be used as an aid against rheumatism. Bullet ants are used to seal wounds. The ants have strong mandibles, or jaws are placed over an open wound. The ant's mandibles seal the wound tightly, and the saliva of the bullet ant provides an extra layer of protection for the wound.\nThe good news is that bullet ants do not live in North America. However, you may encounter some when visiting a zoo or when traveling abroad, especially to Central or South America. In the off chance you experience a bullet ant sting, have someone take you to the emergency room immediately. You cannot drive because of the pain that will hit you about ten minutes after being stung. Also, take an antihistamine. Many people are allergic to bullet ant stings and may suffer severe allergic reactions, including anaphylactic shock.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<!--\ngoogle_ad_client = \"pub-2578104988343239\";\n/* 468x15, created 2/19/09 */\ngoogle_ad_slot = \"7246903869\";\ngoogle_ad_width = 468;\ngoogle_ad_height = 15;\n//-->\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndiv#usernotes {\n\tbackground-color: transparent;\n}\ndiv#usernotes div.head, div#usernotes div.foot {\n\tbackground-color: transparent;\n\tpadding: 4px;\n}\ndiv#usernotes div.foot {\n\ttext-align: right;\n}\n\ndiv#usernotes div.foot form {\n\ttext-align: right;\n\tbackground: #FFFFFF; \n}\n\ndiv#usernotes div.foot a, div#usernotes div.head a {\n\tbackground-color: transparent;\n}\ndiv#usernotes span.action {\n\tfloat: right;\n}\ndiv#usernotes div.note {\n\tmargin-left: 2em; \n\tmargin-right: 2em; \n\tborder-bottom:1px dashed;\n\tpadding: 4px;\n}\ndiv#usernotes div.text {\n\tpadding: 2px;\n\tmargin-top: 4px;\n}\n\n\n\nComments\n \nAlecia\n07 Apr 2009, 17:41\n\n  Oh my gosh!

He\nhad the misfortune to be bitten by these ants during a foray into a remote\narea one afternoon.  He literally sat down in the middle of a nest of them.\n He was incapacitated for days by the bites and grandma feared that he\nwould die.  At the moment he was bitten, grandpa was terrified and didn't\nunderstand what was happening to him.  But as he told me later, nothing\nbefore or since has been as painful.  He literally cried from the pain; and\nmy grandpa was no sissy at all.\n  \n \nmikenordy\n31 Oct 2010, 19:52\n\n  I got bit 3 times in Peru. I was staying in an ecolodge and  was walking to\ndinner when it felt like a hot needle stabed me in my shoulder. I yanked\noff my shirt infront of everyone and started slapping my shoulders. the\nguides looked in  my shirt and found the bullet ant. i took 3 benadrylls\nand couldnt lift my arms the rest of the night. However when I awoke the\nnext morning I felt so much better. The pain only took 12 hours to ware off\nfor me and I never cried. It hurt like horribly, but its certainly not the\nworst pain in the world. If u are bitten u need to take benadryll as soon\nas possible.

I dont personally carry anti-histamine so could initially only curse\nexpletives but had to focus and concentrate as our guide had disappeared\nand i was lost with 2 of my daughters. We had to clear our way out of very\nspiny forest before stumbling on to a path and meeting a local Ashaninca\nwoman. After an hour i could no longer hold a machete, the pain would not\nallow me to sit down, just dance from foot to foot. There was still a tough\n4 hours to our destination village, hospital and doctor were 2 days away, a\nprecipitous path to descend plus the usual bees and wasps and ants. My leg\nmuscles were cramping involuntarily and the surface of my skin was rippling\nwith tiny muscle spasms. Yes, it was just about ok after 24 hours but i can\nconfirm it hurts indescribably, way ahead of scorpion sting i experienced\nin the N Australian outback. Just dont put your hand round a thin tree - my\nprotaganist was hidden the other side.

True bullet ants,\nParaponera, are not found outside the tropics and are actually a fair bit\nbigger than the Pachycondyla. \n  \n \nDanny\n10 Nov 2013, 05:10\n\n  South Texas does indeed have a version of the bullet ant. It's common name\nis \"hairy panther ant\". They walk the ground solitarily to search for bugs\nto sting, kill, and drag back to the nest. BTW, it's really hard to locate\none of their nests, but if you live anywhere near one, you must locate it\nand destroy it. These wandering ants have no discretion about what places\nthey wander, and crawl around the inside of your home. They're brutal.\n  \n \nwtf\n17 Feb 2014, 10:56\n\n  what the heck obviously it stings\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Name: \n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail:\n\n\nthe most painful sting out of all the invertebrates in the world.

Well, you should be.';\ndigg_media = 'news';\ndigg_topic = 'general_sciences';\n\n\n\nThere are about  \n10,000,000,000,000,000,000 insects on earth at any given moment. Seriously, that's a real number. For every one of us, there are 1.5 billion bugs. \n\n\nBut some of them are so horrifying, just one is too many. Here are five you want to avoid at all costs.\n\nJapanese Giant Hornet (vespa mandarinia japonica)\n\n\n\n\nFrom: Japan, obviously.\n\n\nWhy you must fear it:\n\nIt's the size of your thumb and it can spray flesh-melting poison.\n   We really wish we were making that up for, you know, dramatic effect because goddamn, what a terrible thing a three-inch acid-shooting hornet would be, you know? Oh, hey, did we mention it shoots it into your eyes? Or that the poison also has a pheromone cocktail in it that'll call every hornet in the hive to come over and sting you until you are no longer alive?\n\n\nThink you can outrun it? It can fly 50 miles in a day. It'd be nice to say something reassuring at this point, like \"Don't worry, they only live on top of really tall mountains where nobody wants to live,\" but no, they live all over the goddamned place, including outside Tokyo.\n\n\nForty people die like that every year, each of them horribly.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore scary shit:\n\nHere's how the Japanese hornet treats other insects (and would presumably treat us, if we were small enough). An adult hornet will fly miles to find some squishy shit to feed to its children. Often times, it finds its food in, say, a hive inhabited by thousands of bees.\n\n\nWhat to do? Well, Vespa japonica sprays the nest with some of the acid/pheromone and brings in reinforcements, usually consisting of  30 or so fellow hornets. They then descend upon the beehive like an unholy plague of hell-born death engines and proceed to make this world a scary goddamned place. This is maybe 30 wasps against 30,000 bees and the 30,000 bees do not stand a chance.  \n\n\n\n\n\nBehold the hornets systematically seize them with huge, wicked jaws and literally fucking cut them apart, one by one by one by fucking one.  In three hours, there are piles of limbs and heads and just fucking bits of things that could possibly have been alive at one point, and the hornets have stormed the hive and flown away with all the bee's children. Who will then be eaten.\n\n\n\n\n\nNature is fucking hardcore.\n\nBullet Ant (Paraponera clavata)\n\n\n\n\nFrom:\n\nRainforests from Nicaragua to Paraguay\n\n\nWhy you must fear it:\n\nIt's a full inch long, it lives in trees and thus can and will fall on you to scare you away from its hive--the one you didn't know was there, because it's in a fucking tree. Before it does this, it shrieks at you.  This ant, you see, can shriek.  \n\n\nIt's called a Bullet Ant because its 'unusually severe' sting feels like getting shot.\n On the Schmidt Sting Index, Bullet Ants rate as the number one most try-not-to-shit-out-your-spine painful in the entirety of the Kingdom Arthropoda.\n   Also--and we do feel the need to stress this--they fucking shriek at you before they attack.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore scary shit:\n\n Are you the sort of person who likes to think of yourself as tough? A \"badass,\" perhaps? \"Hard,\" as they say?\n\n\n Some of the indigenous peoples of the area use Bullet Ants as part of this initiation-to-manhood ceremony that they do. You know the kind we mean, with us it's like, a big party and your relatives give you money and everyone loves you and is so proud of you? Yeah with them, it's these special leaf sleeves with hundreds of bullet ants woven into them, stingers-inwards. They put them on and are immediately stung to holy fucking bejeezus by, and this is important, hundreds of Bullet Ants woven into the sleeves, stingers-inward.\n\n\n\n\n\n   The goal is to leave them on for 10 minutes, after which their arms are stiff, useless lengths of twisting agony, their bodies wracked with uncontrollable spasms for days. And in order to be actually pass the ordeal and become a man, they have to do it 20 fucking times.\n\nAfricanized Honey Bee (Apis mellifera scutellata)\n\n\n\n\nFrom:\n\nSouth and Central America, the American Southwest\n\n\nWhy you must fear it:\n\nYou know how you can spot one of these? You can't. There is no physical way to determine the difference between an Africanized bee and a common European bee. None whatsoever.\n\n\nYou can, however, easily tell the difference based on their behavior. Regular bees will give you about nine seconds of being too close to the hive before deciding you're a threat and then attacking you. So it's pretty easy to just walk past them without any screams. And if you do get them after you, they'll consider you to be 'chased off' after about 300 feet.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfricanized bees do not roll this way. They give you half a second of being too close before they decide it is time to completely fuck your shit up and empty the entire hive--tens, maybe hundreds of thousands of angry, angry bees. When you run, flailing and crying and soiling yourself while screaming \"JESUS CHRIST I'M COVERED IN BEES,\" they will chase you for over half a mile.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore scary shit:\n\nAfricanized bees owe their existence to science. Warwick E. Kerr created them in Brazil during the 1950s by crossing a European bee with an African bee. He wanted a bee that could live in the jungle. He got a bee that swarms by the hundreds of millions, is insanely territorial, mindlessly aggressive, has killed anywhere from a few dozen to a few thousand people. And, can live in the jungle.\n\n\n And after they escaped and swarmed northward, it turned out they were a-OK with deserts, too. They'll be in Montana by 2010. \n\nArmy or Soldier Ant (Eciton burchellii)\n\n\n\n\nFrom:\n\nThe Amazon Basin. There's other subfamilies living in Asia and Africa, but these are the most notorious.\n\n\nWhy you must fear it:\n\n By now, you will not be surprised to hear that these ants are, in fact, fucking huge, with the soldiers reaching a half inch in length. You will also not be surprised to learn that they have massive, powerful, machete-like jaws half the length of the soldiers themselves. They're notorious for dismantling any living thing in their path, regardless of size. They're also completely blind, which for some reason makes the whole thing worse.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey're called 'Army' ants because their entire colony, comprising up to and over one million insects, is a 100 percent mobile battalion. They don't make permanent hives like other ants, no, they bivouac down in single locations just long enough for the queen to shit out thousands of eggs, while the soldiers spread out in wide fans daily in search of food (\"food\"  here, means \"anything moving\"). Then the eggs hatch and they enter the dreaded swarm phase of their existence.\n\n\n\n\n\n   Much like the word \"killer,\" nature takes words like \"dreaded\" and \"swarm\" very, very seriously.\n   They carefully pick up their larvae and go on the move, a near-solid mass of insect death and horror moving steadily and swiftly along the jungle floor, flaying alive and disassembling every living thing too stupid, slow or asleep to get the living fuck out of the way. There is no talk of painful stingers or ballistic acid here, no, this is terror of a far more primordial nature--the kind that simply flows over you by the hundreds of thousands and rips you apart with massive, unbelievably powerful jaws, utterly and literally blind to size and species, considering everything in their path to be a threat to the continuation of their colony.\nThere are reports of animals the size of horses being overwhelmed and shredded by them. Go stand next to a horse and then think about what that means for you. \n\n\nMore scary shit:\n\nArmy Ants are masters of wholly-organic, living architecture.  \n   For the good of the colony, the ants will use their own living bodies to build any conceivable structure necessary, latching on to each other foot-to-foot to create protective walls and ceilings against the ravages of the weather, bridges to cross otherwise impassable spans, whatever happens to be needed. (Can they form themselves into a crude catapult mechanism and launch themselves at prey? Not yet.) \n\n\nThere is no other living thing in the entire world that does this. \n\n\nAnd, they're blind.\n\n\nNow, time for the disclaimer. If you are squeamish or have a weak stomach or value your sanity in any way, you may want to bail out now.\n\n\nOkay, here goes...\n\nBot Fly (family oestridae, genus and species varies)\n\n\n\n\nFrom:\n\nMost species found in Central and South America, some species found all over the world\n\n\nWhy you must fear it:\n\nOh boy. Ohhhhh boy. Okay, Bot flies. \n\n There are dozens of varieties of Bot Fly, they're each highly adapted to target a specific animal, they have delightfully descriptive names like Horse Stomach Bot Fly, Sheep Nose Bot Fly and, hey, guess what. One of them is called Human Bot Fly.\n\n\nThere are about  \n10,000,000,000,000,000,000 insects on earth at any given moment. Seriously, that's a real number. For every one of us, there are 1.5 billion bugs. \n\n\nBut some of them are so horrifying, just one is too many. Here are five you want to avoid at all costs.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom: Japan, obviously.\n\n\nWhy you must fear it:\n\nIt's the size of your thumb and it can spray flesh-melting poison.\n   We really wish we were making that up for, you know, dramatic effect because goddamn, what a terrible thing a three-inch acid-shooting hornet would be, you know? Oh, hey, did we mention it shoots it into your eyes? Or that the poison also has a pheromone cocktail in it that'll call every hornet in the hive to come over and sting you until you are no longer alive?\n\n\nThink you can outrun it? It can fly 50 miles in a day. It'd be nice to say something reassuring at this point, like \"Don't worry, they only live on top of really tall mountains where nobody wants to live,\" but no, they live all over the goddamned place, including outside Tokyo.\n\n\nForty people die like that every year, each of them horribly.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore scary shit:\n\nHere's how the Japanese hornet treats other insects (and would presumably treat us, if we were small enough). An adult hornet will fly miles to find some squishy shit to feed to its children. Often times, it finds its food in, say, a hive inhabited by thousands of bees.\n\n\nWhat to do? Well, Vespa japonica sprays the nest with some of the acid/pheromone and brings in reinforcements, usually consisting of  30 or so fellow hornets. They then descend upon the beehive like an unholy plague of hell-born death engines and proceed to make this world a scary goddamned place. This is maybe 30 wasps against 30,000 bees and the 30,000 bees do not stand a chance.  \n\n\n\n\n\nBehold the hornets systematically seize them with huge, wicked jaws and literally fucking cut them apart, one by one by one by fucking one.  In three hours, there are piles of limbs and heads and just fucking bits of things that could possibly have been alive at one point, and the hornets have stormed the hive and flown away with all the bee's children. Who will then be eaten.\n\n\n\n\n\nNature is fucking hardcore.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom:\n\nRainforests from Nicaragua to Paraguay\n\n\nWhy you must fear it:\n\nIt's a full inch long, it lives in trees and thus can and will fall on you to scare you away from its hive--the one you didn't know was there, because it's in a fucking tree. Before it does this, it shrieks at you.  This ant, you see, can shriek.  \n\n\nIt's called a Bullet Ant because its 'unusually severe' sting feels like getting shot.\n On the Schmidt Sting Index, Bullet Ants rate as the number one most try-not-to-shit-out-your-spine painful in the entirety of the Kingdom Arthropoda.\n   Also--and we do feel the need to stress this--they fucking shriek at you before they attack.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore scary shit:\n\n Are you the sort of person who likes to think of yourself as tough? A \"badass,\" perhaps? \"Hard,\" as they say?\n\n\n Some of the indigenous peoples of the area use Bullet Ants as part of this initiation-to-manhood ceremony that they do. You know the kind we mean, with us it's like, a big party and your relatives give you money and everyone loves you and is so proud of you? Yeah with them, it's these special leaf sleeves with hundreds of bullet ants woven into them, stingers-inwards. They put them on and are immediately stung to holy fucking bejeezus by, and this is important, hundreds of Bullet Ants woven into the sleeves, stingers-inward.\n\n\n\n\n\n   The goal is to leave them on for 10 minutes, after which their arms are stiff, useless lengths of twisting agony, their bodies wracked with uncontrollable spasms for days. And in order to be actually pass the ordeal and become a man, they have to do it 20 fucking times.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom:\n\nSouth and Central America, the American Southwest\n\n\nWhy you must fear it:\n\nYou know how you can spot one of these? You can't. There is no physical way to determine the difference between an Africanized bee and a common European bee. None whatsoever.\n\n\nYou can, however, easily tell the difference based on their behavior. Regular bees will give you about nine seconds of being too close to the hive before deciding you're a threat and then attacking you. So it's pretty easy to just walk past them without any screams. And if you do get them after you, they'll consider you to be 'chased off' after about 300 feet.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfricanized bees do not roll this way. They give you half a second of being too close before they decide it is time to completely fuck your shit up and empty the entire hive--tens, maybe hundreds of thousands of angry, angry bees. When you run, flailing and crying and soiling yourself while screaming \"JESUS CHRIST I'M COVERED IN BEES,\" they will chase you for over half a mile.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore scary shit:\n\nAfricanized bees owe their existence to science. Warwick E. Kerr created them in Brazil during the 1950s by crossing a European bee with an African bee. He wanted a bee that could live in the jungle. He got a bee that swarms by the hundreds of millions, is insanely territorial, mindlessly aggressive, has killed anywhere from a few dozen to a few thousand people. And, can live in the jungle.\n\n\n And after they escaped and swarmed northward, it turned out they were a-OK with deserts, too. They'll be in Montana by 2010. \n\n\n\n\n\nFrom:\n\nThe Amazon Basin. There's other subfamilies living in Asia and Africa, but these are the most notorious.\n\n\nWhy you must fear it:\n\n By now, you will not be surprised to hear that these ants are, in fact, fucking huge, with the soldiers reaching a half inch in length. You will also not be surprised to learn that they have massive, powerful, machete-like jaws half the length of the soldiers themselves. They're notorious for dismantling any living thing in their path, regardless of size. They're also completely blind, which for some reason makes the whole thing worse.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey're called 'Army' ants because their entire colony, comprising up to and over one million insects, is a 100 percent mobile battalion. They don't make permanent hives like other ants, no, they bivouac down in single locations just long enough for the queen to shit out thousands of eggs, while the soldiers spread out in wide fans daily in search of food (\"food\"  here, means \"anything moving\"). Then the eggs hatch and they enter the dreaded swarm phase of their existence.\n\n\n\n\n\n   Much like the word \"killer,\" nature takes words like \"dreaded\" and \"swarm\" very, very seriously.\n   They carefully pick up their larvae and go on the move, a near-solid mass of insect death and horror moving steadily and swiftly along the jungle floor, flaying alive and disassembling every living thing too stupid, slow or asleep to get the living fuck out of the way. There is no talk of painful stingers or ballistic acid here, no, this is terror of a far more primordial nature--the kind that simply flows over you by the hundreds of thousands and rips you apart with massive, unbelievably powerful jaws, utterly and literally blind to size and species, considering everything in their path to be a threat to the continuation of their colony.\nThere are reports of animals the size of horses being overwhelmed and shredded by them.

Ohhhhh boy. Okay, Bot flies. \n\n\n  They each have a different and elaborate reproductive cycle, all of which end with a fat, half-inch maggot embedded in living flesh.  Feeding.  \n\n\n\n\n\n   Horse Stomach Bots, for example, lay their eggs in grass. Horses eat the grass. And the eggs. Which hatch in the heat of the horse's mouth.  Upon which they chew through the horse's tongue and burrow, through the horse, into its belly. Where they meet up and dig honeycombs into the horse's stomach. And get fat. When they're ready to be flies, they just let go and get pooped out of the system.\n\n\nThe Human Bot Fly lays its eggs on a horsefly or a mosquito, something that will attempt to land on a human. This carrier finds a human and lands on him or her. The eggs rub off onto the human, whose body heat hatches the eggs. The larvae drop onto the skin and burrow right the fuck in. Where they live. Under your skin. Eating.\n\n\nHere's video of them removing one. DO NOT FUCKING WATCH THIS. Fuck, we don't even know why we linked it.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore scary shit:\n\n Here is the best part. The larvae can grow anywhere in your body, it just depends on where the eggs wind up. Which could end up with you having a fat wormy thing in your tear duct. Or your brain. We know, because that's happened.  \n\n\n\n\n\nA Human Bot Fly larvae, burrowing into your brain. Eating your thoughts.\n\nAll this learning and fear remind you of high school?

Well, the searing sting of this New World tropical species apparently feels like a gunshot wound. It tops Justin Schmidt\u2019s 4-point sting pain index:\nPure, intense, brilliant pain. Like fire-walking over flaming charcoal with a 3-inch rusty nail in your heel.\nParaponera clavata is one of those animals, like jaguars and monkeys, that everybody talks about in the rain forest. While there are certainly deadlier animals lurking in the Amazon, some snakes and big cats, Paraponera is respected as a more everpresent threat. It is one of the most dangerous species you are liable to encounter on a daily basis. The giant, inch-long workers are commonly seen walking up and down tree trunks as they travel from their soil nests up to the rich foraging grounds of the forest canopy.\nAnd just how dangerous is the infamous bullet ant?\nActually, not so much as you\u2019d think. Stories of people coming to permanent harm or death from Paraponera stings are rare. Mostly, the experience just hurts a lot. Or so I\u2019m told. In taking these photographs not once did any of the ants try to sting me, even when walking on my hand.\n\nWhile Paraponera is popularly known for the sting, Myrmecologists like these insects for a different reason: it\u2019s an odd evolutionary relict. Paraponera clavata is a single species in the lone genus in its subfamily, Paraponerinae, that last shared an ancestor with other ants over 90 million years ago. That\u2019s right back near the very origin of the ant family. This single lineage represents a unique evolutionary trajectory stemming from the early poneroid ants, and as such is invaluable for comparative studies on ant form, behavior, and ecology.\n\n\n\nWhether you\u2019re intrigued by the fear factor or interested in more scholarly pursuits, Paraponera is an animal worth looking out for during your next Neotropical vacation.\nMore bullet ant photos here.\nAnd speaking of extra long tongues, that is quite an extensible labium Paraponera has!\nI\u2019ve been waiting for the opportunity to pop this question \u2014 For a long time these were thought to be close to Ectatomma, which they do rather resemble. To wit: http://www.alexanderwild.com/Ants/Taxonomic-List-of-Ant-Genera/Ectatomma/8714468_HsL58#1174021656_TAuTe-A-LB\nAnd seems to me I heard some muttering about Paraponera possibly being closer to Myrmecia than to poneromorphs. Is this another sort of Martialis-Anomalomyrma situation?\nI looked at Paraponera morphology quite extensively, and I have to say they really show a mixture of features from different subfamilies: their maxillae are very Ponerinae like; their mandibles and antennal sockets very Ectatomminae like; while the petiole and gaster has some Myrmeciinae features. Reading Bill Brown\u2019s monographs, I can see why they were classified as allied to ectatommines for a long time: they were considered ponerines in the old, inclusive sense (meaning, NOT-any other derived subfamily), that had the antennal sockets NOT-together like currently recognized ponerines, and large frontal lobes. Those were ectatommines (even including proceratiines). Now, all those features happen to be plesiomorphies.\nWhile Paraponera seems to be a real relic, in-between lineages, I am very skeptical of its current position as sister to Tatuidris (basically). Both groups are very long branches, and it seems we have the usual problem of a phylogenetic artifact. Not sure how we are going to deal with this.\nThanks, Roberto, for your typically insightful comments!  I agree re: Tatuidris. Resolving these deep relationships may come down to shared rare genomic events.\nI\u2019m proud to boast that I was stung by one of these guys!  Painful?  Yes.  Near-death experience?  Not even.\nThansk roberto, very interesting. And looking forward to what others will say, too\u2026\nIn Ecuador a couple of years ago, I let a variety of Pseudomyrmex spp. sting me to compare the results, but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to let one of these giants sting me. Accident or purposeful experience, Ted?\nAccidental \u2013 I had been warned about them and was very careful, but one day I found a tree fall and was crawling through it picking off beetles.  I leaned my arm against a branch and got nailed!  Definitely the most painful sting I\u2019ve ever experienced.\nJustin Schmidt is also the only person I\u2019ve every seen cited on the topic of what velvet mites taste like (he reportedly says they \u201ctaste unpleasant\u201d). I wonder if he is also going to come up with an insect flavor index?\nIs this the ant they use for a men\u2019s coming-of-age ceremony in a certain South American tribe? They put the ants to sleep using a certain temporary poison, then they weave them into a kind of glove which they put on the boy. When the ants wake up, they sting (or bite, I don\u2019t know which end they use) his hand until he nearly dies of pain. On the first anniversary of this ordeal, he is put through it again, and is thereby able to compare two kinds of agony: the one for which he was initially unprepared, and the one which he knew only two well, and could feel anxious about for the whole year.\nThis is definitely the ant! I should probably post one of those videos.\nAny evolutionary explanation for such a powerful sting? Could it be related with an specialized prey which, perhaps, has developed an strong resistance?\nSay, what\u2019s with that luxuriant-looking gold fur on the first pair of tarsi?  Maybe it\u2019s associated with a gland?\nI\u2019d like to know the answer to that, too. I don\u2019t know anyone has figured out yet what tarsal fur does, but a glandular association seems a good starting hypothesis.\nThat\u2019s fascinating, Alex.  Everything I\u2019ve seen and read has made these guys out to be easily provoked and horribly memorable for the experience.  Yet here they are being docile and reasonable.  Very cool!\nOr maybe, I\u2019m just the ant whisperer.\nI was stung by ants on 3 occasions during the 6 months I was in Panama, twice by bullet ants and once by yellow and black ants that were somewhat smaller but also had colonies in trees.  I was working for the Peregrine Fund, and one of my jobs included using ropes to pull dead rats into trees for fledgling Harpy Eagles, nearly always in the dark.  Our ropes stayed in the trees and were used as walkways by the ants.  We\u2019d flick the ropes to try to remove all ants, but it obviously didn\u2019t always work.  I can honestly say that these stings were the most painful experience in my life thus far.  During the third occasion, I was actually stung in 3 spots, and I tried everything in our medical bin\u2013 even hemorrhoid cream- to try to stop the horrible throbbing pain!  Miraculously, Neosporin with pain relief worked to dull the pain.\nAlex, get stung for experience!\nPingback: The Sunday Bug Bash | The Bug Whisperer\nI would love to know what the yellow and gold ant is mentioned by Lisa Above. I live in the central pacific of Costa Rica and have found a nest of 3/4 inch long ants with gold(yellow) gasters that seem pretty hostile.\nMight be Pachycondyla villosa:\nhttp://www.alexanderwild.com/Ants/Taxonomic-List-of-Ant-Genera/Pachycondyla/9274860_TLxdxd/4/1191488735_amEcM#!i=1191488735&k=amEcM\nPingback: Bullet ants\nYou can find lots of victims to these ants in the scores of military members that have attended the Jungle Operations Training Center at Ft. Sherman, Panama (myself included).  Definitely a painful sting that left a large indurated mass at the bite site for an extended period of time.  I\u2019m not sure if the indurated site is typical for the stings of these monsters.  I\u2019m not scared of much but I\u2019ll climb down from my man chair for these guys.

He says that the most painful is a bullet ant (pictured) which he says 'makes you want to lay down and die'\nMr Schmidt\u2019s scale ranges from zero to four, with a one being a minor reaction, and four being the worst pain you can imagine.\nMr Schmidt explained to\u00a0Weather.com what a one on the scale would be.\nFire Ant - one (pain lasts two to four minutes)\nHoneybee - two (pain lasts up to ten minutes)\nBumblebee - two (pain for up to five minutes)\nGerman Yellowjacket - two (pain lasts four to ten minutes)\nVelvet Ant - three (pain for up to 30 minutes)\nHarvester Ant - three (pain for one to eight hours)\nPaper Wasp - three (pain for five to 15 minutes)\nWarrior Wasp - four (pain for up to two hours)\nTarantula Hawk - four (pain for three minutes)\nBullet Ant - four (pain for 12 to 24 hours)\nHe said it would cause a sharp pain but would not be enough to make you drop your drink. \nHowever, he goes on to explain how he\n would describe a four \u2013 this would be a creature such as a tarantula \nhawk, which he says feels like being hit by 20,000 volts. \n\nNot only would it make you drop your drink, it would make you throw it across the room, he says.\nHe told Weather.com that a bullet ant has the most painful sting he has encountered.\nHe said: 'They just make you want to lay down and die. You are just screaming in pain and agony.'\nIn contrast, he said that the sting of a fire ant is much less painful.\nHe said: 'They have this kind of sharp, piercing sting.\n'Your immediate reaction is \"brush those things off\". That's all its going to do to you.'\nMr Schmidt ranks the bug's stings from zero to four with four being the worst pain imaginable. He rated the sting of the tarantula hawk (pictured) a four\nMr Schmidt believes he has been stung by 150 different bugs.

They use their antennae to \"smell\" food, danger, and each other.\nAdult bullet ants feed solely on nectar. But they feed their young (grubs) animal matter: invertebrates and other small animals. \nWe keep bullet ants at our Zoo whenever possible.

Their common name velvet ant refers to their dense pile of hair which most often is bright scarlet or orange, but may also be black, white, silver, or gold. Black and white specimens are sometimes known as panda ants due to their hair coloration resembling that of the Chinese giant panda. Their bright colors serve as aposematic signals. They are known for their extremely painful stings, hence the common name cow killer or cow ant. Unlike a real ant, they do not have drones, workers, and queens. However, velvet ants do exhibit haplodiploid sex determination similar to other members of Vespoidea.\n\n\nThe exoskeleton of all velvet ants is unusually tough (to the point that some entomologists have reported difficulty piercing them with steel pins when attempting to mount them for display in cabinets). This characteristic allows them to successfully invade the nests of their prey and also helps them retain moisture. Like related families in the Vespoidea, males have wings but females uniformly are wingless. They exhibit extreme sexual dimorphism; the males and females are so different, it is almost impossible to associate the two sexes of a species unless they are captured while mating. In a few species, the male is so much larger than the female, he carries her aloft while mating, which is also seen in the related family Tiphiidae.\nIn mutillids, as in all Hymenoptera, only the female is capable of inflicting a sting because the stinger itself is a modified female organ called an ovipositor; female mutillids have unusually long and maneuverable stingers. In both sexes, a structure called a stridulitrum on the metasoma is used to produce a squeaking or chirping sound when alarmed. Both sexes of mutillids also bear hair-lined grooves on the side of the metasoma called felt lines. Only one other vespoid family, the Bradynobaenidae, has felt lines, but the females have a distinct pronotum and an elongated ant-like petiole.\nMature mutillids feed on nectar. Although some species are strictly nocturnal, females are often active during the day. Females of Tricholabiodes thisbe are sometimes active up to two hours before sunset. Guido Nonveiller (1963) hypothesized the Mutillidae are generally stenothermic and thermophilic; they may not avoid light, but rather are active during temperatures which usually occur only after sunset.\nThe male locates a female on the wing, and mates with her. The female then enters an insect nest, typically a ground-nesting bee, such as a bumblebee, or wasp nest, and deposits one egg near each larva or pupa. Her young then develop as idiobiont ectoparasitoids, eventually killing their immobile larval/pupal hosts within a few days.\nThe 3,000-5,000 species of Mutillidae occur worldwide, mainly in the dry tropics. They are especially common, however, in desert and sandy areas, with most of the over 400 North American species found in the southwestern United States and adjacent parts of Mexico, with others found in generally sandy regions throughout the United States and Canada."], ["Velvet Ant or Cow Killer Ant", "http://lancaster.unl.edu/pest/resources/cowkiller.shtml", " Skip Navigation \n\nYour browser does not appear to support JavaScript, or you have turned JavaScript off.

The females are wingless and are sometimes mistaken for a large, hairy, orange and black ant. These \"ants\" are actually wasp! A solitary wasp, the velvet ant does not live in colonies or have a \"nest\". They are found crawling through lawns, digging around soil, or even in garages where they have wandered in by accident.\nVelvet ants are not aggressive and will try to escape from you. The females have a very painful sting if handled. The name \"Cow Killer Ant\" was given to the velvet ant because of the reputation of the female's sting. It is said that the sting is so painful that it could kill a cow. This handsome insect does make a sound (especially when stepped on) but the squeaks of the cow killer ant would hardly be heard over the painful screams, if the person stepping on the wasp was barefoot.\nThe information on this Web site is valid for residents of southeastern Nebraska. It may or may not apply in your area. If you live outside southeastern Nebraska, visit your local Extension office\nContact Information\nThe adult velvet ants feed on nectar and water. The immature stages are external parasites of wasp that nest in the ground like cicada killer wasp. Cicada killer wasp dig burrows into the ground. The adult cicada killer wasp capture and paralyze cicadas and drag them into the underground burrow. The wasp lays an egg on the cicada and after it hatches, the cicada killer wasp larva uses the cicada as a food source. \nHere is where the velvet ant comes into the picture. After the developing cicada killer wasp have formed cocoons, the adult female velvet ants slip into the hole in the ground where the nest is located and lays eggs on the cocoon. The velvet ant larvae hatch and feed on, eventually killing, the developing wasp larvae. When it ready to become an adult, the velvet ant pupates inside the nest of the wasp where it will emerge the next season.\nVelvet ants do not cause damage and no chemical controls are need. Velvet ants should be left alone, but if control is desired, make sure you have on a heavy-soled shoe before stepping on the insect!\r\n\r\n "], ["Velvet Ants - National Pest Management Association", "http://www.pestworld.org/pest-guide/stingingbiting-insects/velvet-ants-cow-killers/", "Velvet ants are solitary and usually found only one at a time.\r\nTo avoid these stinging ants, contact a pest management\r\nprofessional to safely remove any cow killer ants found in your\r\nhome.\n\nFind a qualified pro in the U.S. or Canada:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr, find a professional in another country:\n\n\n\nSelect a Country\nAlgeria\nArgentina\nAruba\nAustralia\nAzerbaijan\nBahamas\nBahrain\nBarbados\nBermuda\nBrazil\nBrunei\nCambodia\nCameroon\nCayman Islands\nChile\nChina\nColombia\nCosta Rica\nCyprus\nCzech Republic\nDenmark\nDominican Repu...\nDominion Repub...\nEcuador\nEgypt\nEl Salvador\nEl Salvodor\nEngland\nFiji\nFinland\nFrance\nGermany\nGhana\nGreece\nGuam\nGuatemala\nGuinea Ecuator...\nHaiti\nHonduras\nHong Kong\nIndia\nIndonesia\nIreland\nIsrael\nItaly\nJamaica\nJapan\nJordan\nKorea\nKuwait\nLatvia\nLebanon\nLibya\nMalaysia\nMarshall Islan...\nMauritius\nMexico\nNamibia\nNetherlands\nNew Zealand\nNigeria\nOman\nPakistan\nPanama\nParaguay\nPeru\nPhilippines\nPhillipines\nPortugal\nQatar\nRussia\nSaipan\nSaudi Arabia\nSeychelles\nSingapore\nSouth Africa\nSouth Korea\nSpain\nSri Lanka\nSt. Maartin\nSultanate of O...\nSweden\nSwitzerland\nTaiwan\nTaiwan R.O.C.\nThailand\nTrinidad\nTrinidad & Tob...\nTrinidad and T...\nTurkey\nUAE\nUganda\nUnited Arab Em...\nUnited Kingdom\nUruguay\nVenezuela\nViet Nam\nVietnam\nWest Indies\n\n\n\n\n\u25ba Tips on choosing a qualified professional\n\nFemale velvet ants dig into the nesting chambers of\r\nground-nesting bees and wasps and lay their eggs on the larvae\r\ninside.

These insects are not ants but are, in fact, wasps. Males are winged, and are not frequently observed by most people. Females are wingless, ant-like in general appearance, and may be seen scurrying about on the ground. Both males and females are covered by dense, velvety pubescence, hence the name velvet ant. They are also sometimes called \u201ccow ants\u201d or \u201ccow killers\u201d (although there is nothing to indicate that any cow has ever been killed by one).\nAlthough not as abundant in the Southeast as in the Southwest, the family is still represented in South Carolina by six different genera and 41 different species. Of these, only one is commonly seen by the general public, Dasymutilla occidentalis, the large red and black velvet ant pictured above. Most of the velvet ants belonging to the genus Dasymutilla are relatively large (1/2\"-1\" in length) and brightly colored. Many have brilliant patterns of black with red, yellow, or orange. The colors make these wasps distinct. This acts much like a yellow or red traffic light, giving warning of possible danger. Although the winged males are harmless, the wingless females can inflict a severe sting S one to be avoided. The sting, though extremely painful, is rarely dangerous. Velvet ants may also produce a squeaking sound when disturbed. This also acts as a warning. The sound is produced by rubbing parts of two abdominal segments across one another.\nVelvet ants may be seen during the warm periods of the year. In South Carolina, they are common from about May through September. They are most commonly seen during the cooler daylight hours, especially late in the afternoon.\nInformation on the biology of velvet ants is incomplete. It is known that they are parasites of other predominantly ground-nesting bees and wasps. Females lay their eggs individually upon the pupae or prepupae of their host. The parasite then develops at the expense of the host, eventually killing it.\nVelvet ants are rarely plentiful enough to become a nuisance. They usually remain outdoors, in sandy areas, though they may very infrequently be found in dwellings. They should never be picked up by hand, or stepped on with bare feet. Due to an extremely tough integument (outer covering), chemical and mechanical control are not very effective. Careful removal of the insect to a more desirable location is the control method of choice. Or, if they are not hurting anything (or anyone), just leave them alone."], ["Mutillidae - velvet ants", "http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/creatures/misc/wasps/mutillidae.htm", "  Insects in the family Mutillidae are often referred to as \"velvet ants\" because female members of the family lack wings and have coarse setae that cover most of their body, making them resemble hairy ants.  To the surprise of most people, mutillids are not ants at all \u2013 they are wasps\r\n\n\nFigure 1. Adult female \"cow killer,\" Dasymutilla occidentalis  occidentalis (Linnaeus), a velvet ant.

Photograph by Clemson  University, www.forestryimages.org.\n  The Mutillidae family contains approximately 230 genera/subgenera and about 8,000 species worldwide (Manley and Pitts 2002).  Approximately 435 species occur in mostly arid areas of the southern and western parts of North America (Triplehorn and Johnson 2005).  Fifty species in seven genera are found in Florida (Table 1) (Krombein 1979).\r\n\n\r\n  All Mutillidae are solitary parasitoid wasps that mostly attack mature larvae or pupae of other solitary Hymenoptera. However, velvet ants have been observed targeting non-feeding stages of Diptera, Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, Blattodea, and even some eusocial Hymenoptera (Brothers et al. 2000).\r\n  \n Finding a matching reproductive pair can be difficult, if not impossible for some species, because of the extreme sexual dimorphism displayed within this family.  Color patterns and the relative body size of the two sexes of the same species can be very different, making it very difficult to relate one sex with the other (Mickel 1928). \n In Florida, male Mutillidae are frequently larger (heavier) than the females.  One study in south-central Florida found that in seven out of 13 species, the males were heavier than the females.  The remaining six species either showed comparable sizes between the male and female (3) or the female was larger than the male (3) (Deyrup and Manley 1986). \n Biological data is very scarce and differences obviously exist between genera and species, especially with regards to their life cycles and development, but the following has been reported for most Mutillidae.  Females have the difficult job of locating potential hosts.  Suitable hosts may be difficult to find for several reasons including: concealment, low population densities when solitary and lastly, if the hosts are eusocial, they will be heavily defended.  Once a host is located, female velvet ants parasitize the \"hard\" life stages (i.e., hardened pre-pupae, pupae, ootheca, eusocial cells, and cocoons) of the hosts and the emerging velvet ant larvae are essentially ectoparasites of those life stages. (Brothers et al. 2000).  Once development is completed, adults leave the nest and seek a mate. \n  All female Mutillidae are wingless and resemble ants.  They can easily be differentiated from ants by the lack of petiole nodes, which are present on all ant species.  In addition, the mesosomatic (thoracic) segments are completely fused and have at most two segments.  The metasoma (abdomen) contains six visible terga (dorsal surface of any body segment) and a \"felt line\" of dense, closely appressed hairs is located laterally on the second metasomatic tergum (except for the genus Ephuta) (Manley and Pitts 2002, Triplehorn and Johnson 2005).\r\n  \n Unlike the female, the male meso- and metathorax are not fused and they have three mesosomatic segments.  Their metasomal region contains seven visible terga and a felt line is also on the lateral margin of tergite II.  All male Mutillidae found in Florida normally have large wings lacking jugal lobes and forewings with the M and Cu1 veins ending far from the apical margin (Manley and Pitts 2002). \n \nFigure 7.

Like other stinging insects, only female Mutillidae are capable of stinging.  Some species are referred to as \"cow killers\" or \"mule killers,\"  because their sting is said to be painful enough to kill an animal.  Despite this assertion, they are not aggressive nor is their venom comparatively toxic.   Most female mutillids are so docile, they produce a startle response (an audible stridilation) when provoked to warn potential victims of her sting.  The LD50 of their venom when exposed to mice is around 71 mg/kg body weight which is relatively non-toxic compared to the very toxic harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex maricopa, venom (LD50 = 0.12 mg/kg) and the moderately toxic honey bee, Apis mellifera, venom (LD50 = 2.8) (Meyer 1996).

Velvet ants look like   large hairy ants, but they are actually wasps. They differ from ants in having   only a slight constriction between the thorax and abdomen and having straight   rather than elbowed antennae. They may be seen in lawns or pastures, or   occasionally wandering into buildings. These solitary wasps, as the name   implies, are densely covered with short hair. \n\u00a0\nThe males have two pairs of transparent black wings. The females are   wingless, and are sometimes confused with ants. Ants, however, have elbowed   antennae, and a \"hump\" in the constriction between the thorax and abdomen.   Velvet ants are brightly colored. They are shades of yellow and brown or red and   black. Velvet ants are not aggressive and will try to escape when encountered,   but females have a very painful sting if handled. Females use a long,   needle-like stinger concealed at the tip of the abdomen. Many of the velvet ants   can produce a squeaking sound when disturbed. \n\u00a0\nAdult velvet ants feed on nectar and water. The immature stages are external   parasites of bees and wasps that nest in the ground. A few species parasitize   some flies and beetles. Consequently, there are no identifiable nests to treat.   Velvet ants prefer pastures and fields with sandy soil where their prey are most   likely to be found. There is no effective control measure for them. If they are   particularly abundant in an area, it may be helpful in the long run to overseed   to get a better grass cover. This would discourage the ground nesting bees and   wasps on which velvet ants feed. Because velvet ants are uncommon and do not   cause any damage, no chemical control is recommended. \n\u00a0\nOne velvet ant that is commonly submitted for identification is the \u2018cow   killer.\u2019 The cow killer is the largest of the velvet ants in Kentucky, nearly an   inch in length. It earned its name by the reputation of the female\u2019s sting. It   is said that the sting is so painful that it could kill a   cow.\n\u00a0\nThe female is mostly red with some black, the male is half red and half black   with dark wings. Females seek out bumble bee nests and lay eggs inside the wax   cups. After bees or wasps have formed cocoons, adult female velvet ants enter   the host nest by digging through the soil or breaking through nest walls. The   cow killer larvae feed on the bumble bee larvae and pupae and will pupate inside   the bumble bee nest. This bumble bee is ultimately killed. \n\u00a0\nIssued: 9/99 \r\n    Revised: 1/04 \n\u00a0\nCAUTION! Pesticide recommendations in this publication are registered for use in Kentucky, USA ONLY!

The flightless females, which are often encountered while wandering on the ground, especially resemble ants. Two common varieties include thistledown (Dasymutilla gloriosa) and red (Dasymutilla magnifica). Two large ones include the Satan\u2019s, which is black with a yellowish-white abdomen and the D. klugii which is red and black. They are all in the family Mutillidae.\n\n\nVelvet ants range in size from 1/8 inch to one inch, with great variation within species. Size appears to depend upon size of host used during development. Velvet ants look like miniature walking cotton balls. One variety, Dasymutilla gloriosa, has been described as a \"creosote seed with legs\" due to its white, thistledown-like hairs. Red, orange, yellow, black or white bristle-like hairs, known as setae, cover the entire body. Biologists call this type of coloration \"aposematic,\" and they used the term to refer to conspicuous warning colors of animals that predators should avoid.\nMales have wings but no stingers, while females have stingers but lack wings. The heavy, deeply pitted integument (outer covering of body) functions as a suit of armor and can only be penetrated with great difficulty.\nOver 150 species of velvet ants occur throughout the United States, southern Canada and Mexico, although this is a rough number. Only about one third of those species are known from both sexes, while another one third are known from males only, and the final one third, from females only. There is a distinct possibility that many of those males and females belong together in the same species but because of the marked sexual dimorphism, it is not  obvious which males belong with which females and vice-versa. At least three dozen species inhabit Arizona. They live in all parts of the desert from hot and dry to semiarid areas to shrublands.\nVelvet ants are active during the day, and they may be some of the first insects to hit the trail in the morning and last to settle in for the night. They retreat from high ground temperatures in the middle of the day by burrowing under debris or climbing into plants. Nectar is their preferred food. Velvet ants are active from April through November, depending upon local climate. If you see a walking velvet ant, you can be assured that it is a female.\n\n\nOccasionally large aggregations form for courtship and mating. One grouping in Arizona contained an estimated 6000 individuals within 1500 square yards. More often, however, velvet ants are loners with males generally flying low to the ground seeking the wandering females. Biologists are not positive how males find females but believe that vision and pheromones play a part. After mating, females will scurry about looking for wasp or bee pupal chambers. Once found, they will enter a nest and use their ovipositor to lay an egg on or near to the host. If the parent is still present, the velvet ant may be carried away by the other bee or wasp.\nA grub-like larva will emerge from the egg, feed on its host, and grow to full size in a matter days. The shell of the original inhabitant then becomes a site to construct a cocoon for the velvet ant pupa. Some adults emerge that summer while others overwinter in a pupal or prepupal state.\n\n\n DesertUSA Newsletter -- We send articles on hiking, camping and places to explore, as well as animals, wildflower reports, plant information and much more.

The female wasp patrols tree canopies in search of cicadas, which she paralyzes with a sting. She takes wing with her oversize prey and drags it down her four-foot-long nesting burrow. She places one or two cicadas in a chamber, lays an egg on the stunned insects and carefully seals the enclosure.\nA wasp larva soon hatches to consume the cicadas, matures and spends the winter underground \u2014 unless it is itself eaten by the larva of a cow killer.\nCow killers, more often known as velvet ants, aren't ants; they are wingless female wasps that lay eggs on the pupae and mature larvae of cicada killers and other ground-nesting \nEastern velvet ant or \"cow killer\"Dasymutilla occidentalis3/4 inch long\nCicada killerSphecius speciosus2 inches long\nsolitary wasps and bees.

Photo by Bob Wilkin. Bugguide.net\nVelvet ants are not ants at all, but a specialized group of insects belonging to the wasp family Mutillidae. Mutillid wasps can be found in Texas during the summertime in both urban and rural habitats. They are often referred to as velvet ants because the females are wingless, ant-like and often covered with a velvety \u201cfur\u201d. Most kinds of velvet ants are black or brown and they may be strikingly ringed or marked with red, yellow or orange. They range in size from about one-half, to one inch-long and are frequently found outdoors in dry, open areas. Male mutillid wasps are winged and are more wasp-like in appearance.\nSome of the larger species of velvet ants, such as Dasymutilla occidentalis, are occasionally referred to as \u201ccow-killers\u201d because of the painful sting that the female can inflict. This species and some others are capable of producing a \u201csqueaking\u201d sound when trapped or disturbed. Other species of velvet ants are also common in Texas, including the gray velvet ant and the thistle down mutillids, Dasymutilla beutenmulleri and D. fulvohirta.\nKnowledge about the biology of velvet ants is limited, but those that have been studied are mostly parasites on ground-nesting bees and wasps. A few species are known to attack beetles and flies. Females spend much time in sandy areas searching for nests or aggregations of hosts. When a suitable host (e.g., a bee or wasp pupa) is found, the female lays one to two eggs inside its body. Upon hatching, the young feed on the host and devour it. Velvet ants spend the winter inside the nest of their hosts in a pre-adult (pre-pupal) stage. There is usually only one generation a year.\nPeople are most likely to receive a sting from a velvet ant when walking barefoot in infested areas, or by careless handling. The intensity of pain and reaction to the sting will vary according to the sensitivity of the person stung; however the sting is usually much more painful than a bee sting. Velvet ant stings should be cleaned and disinfected like a bee sting. Ice packs and pain-relievers should be applied as necessary. Because velvet ants usually travel alone and are not social, a person is unlikely to receive multiple stings. As with any stinging insect, if the sting victim experiences a generalized rash or difficulty breathing (signs of an allergic reaction) they should see a doctor immediately.\nEffective control measures for velvet ants are limited. The best steps for dealing with a velvet ant \u201cproblem\u201d are 1) educating children not to handle these insects and 2) wearing proper footwear in infested areas. Velvet ants have very hard bodies and are difficult to crush.\nFor more information about other stinging insects refer to Extension fact sheets E-239, Paper Wasps, Yellowjackets and Solitary Wasps or E-346, Honey Bees In and Around Buildings.

Drees, Professor and Extension Entomologist   \nVelvet  ants commonly are encountered in arid, sandy areas of Texas. Although related to wasps, the  wingless females resemble ants and have a dense coating of velvety hair. Males  have wings and actively fly. They are in the family Mutillidae in the order  Hymenoptera that also contains ants, wasps, bees and sawflies.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Krombein et al. (1979) list 30 genera of  Mutillidae in found in North America. Of these  at least 84 species are possibly considered to be \u201cvelvet ants\u201d and occur in Texas.  These species are from the three genera: Timulla \u2013 15 species, Ephuta \u2013 9 species,  and Dasymutilla \u2013 60 species. Many  other species are listed for this family of insects, but most are not normally  thought of as the day-active (diurnal), fuzzy or hair-covered, and colorful  \u201cvelvet ant\u201d species. The most commonly encountered and largest species is  known as the cow killer, Dasymutilla occidentalis comanche Blake (Fig. 1). \n\u00a0\nFigure  1 (left). The cow killer, Dasymutilla occidentalis, adult female.\nFigure  2. Another species of \u201cvelvet ant\u201d (Hymenoptera: Mutillidae) \nBiology\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Velvet ants are solitary wasps. Immature  stages or larvae feed externally on the prepupal or pupal stages of  ground-nesting bees, other wasps and some flies and beetles. The wingless  females actively search for hosts on which to deposit eggs. The host is  attacked after its cocoon has been spun, or the puparium formed. Upon locating  a suitable host, the female penetrates the cocoon or puparium with its long  ovipositor (which can also function as the stinger) and deposits one or two  eggs. \r\n  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Eggs hatch and young larvae feed on the  host, devouring it. After feeding, the velvet ant larva spins its own cocoon  within that of its host. Over-wintering occurs as the prepupal stage inside the  host's cocoon. Developmental times vary between species and in response to  various environmental conditions. \r\n  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Upon emerging as adults, winged males fly  in search of mates. The wingless females attract males of their own species  using specific sound produced by a rasping structure located between their  second and third abdominal segments. Mating lasts for only a few seconds. Males  not searching for females are often found visiting flowers in search of nectar.  They do not live as long as the wingless females. \nImportance \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Females spend much time in sandy areas  searching for hosts and may be encountered at close range by adults and  children. The females are capable of stinging repeatedly. The stinger is long,  and the sting is reportedly quite painful--perhaps the reason that the large  common species is called the \"cow killer\". \r\n  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 People are most often stung by velvet ants  on the foot while walking in infested areas without proper footwear. The  intensity of pain and reaction to the sting will vary according to the  sensitivity of the person stung.\r\n  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Luckily, these are solitary creatures and  the possibility of being stung by a number of these insects at one time is  unlikely.\r\n  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 No one has documented the importance of  velvet ants as parasites of other insects. Ground dwelling bees, often  important in the pollination of some crops such as alfalfa, are known to be  hosts for velvet ants. Other species are reportedly pests of white grub  parasites, a condition known as hyperparasitism. In each of these different  examples, velvet ants can be considered either beneficial or pestiferous  depending upon the host species.\r\n  \u00a0\nControl  Measures\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chemical control of velvet ants is rarely  justified. The best methods for coping with velvet ants are: 1) the education  of youngsters not to (or carefully) handle these insects and 2) wearing shoes  in infested areas to avoid accidental encounters. These insects are very  hard-bodies and difficult to crush by stepping on them. Also, their long stingers  (modified egg-laying structure or ovipositor) are flexible and can inflict a  painful sting even when the end of the abdomen is not directly contacting skin.\r\n  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Occasionally, numbers of velvet ants occur  in certain areas such as gardens or underneath houses, trailers or other  structures raised from the ground.

Login\nLetting a velvet ant crawl on your hand, like in the above photo, might make for great drama, but it is foolish to handle these creatures because they will sting.\nA velvet ant, or cow killer, is actually a unique species of wasp found in the Upstate.\n\nDuring the warm months of summer, a person who looks carefully in newly mowed grass may see the \"cow killer.\"\nThis femme fatale is capable of causing strong sensations, because she is both striking in appearance and capable of packing a wallop when disturbed.\nThe \"velvet ant\" is more often called the cow killer or \"cow ant.\"\nThis female, wingless wasp does not actually kill cows or anything else, but like most wasps, it can deliver a potent sting if molested, according to Clemson University scientists. Growing to lengths from three-quarter to 1 1/2 inches, velvet ants can emit a high-pitched hum or squeak if anything gets too close.\nThe name velvet ant derives from the wasp's fuzzy appearance. The insect is covered with a hairy fur that looks like velvet. These wasps usually are encountered crawling on the ground in fields or lawns and look very much like a large ant. The color of the insect can vary by region from almost pure white in the West to orange and black in the Midwest to the bright red and black of the South. The velvet ant is a unique species of wasp not often seen in the Upstate.\nThe rarely seen male has wings but no stinger and looks nothing like the female. Scientific descriptions of the velvet ant emphasize the \"extreme sexual dimorphism,\" or differences in appearance, between the sexes.\nScientific journals say there are at least 41 species of velvet ant in South Carolina. The most common type seen in the state is Dasymutilla occidentalis. While the insect is not technically an ant, the name has stuck.\n\"Velvet ants are nondestructive and should be left alone if encountered. They are parasitic on many ground nesting wasps and bees,\" said Clemson University entomologist Donald Manley, a noted expert regarding velvet ants.\nClemson entomologist Bob Bellinger said, \"It is sometimes difficult to determine what species you are dealing with unless the wasp is caught in the act of mating with an identifiable female. Their biology is incomplete, and the life cycle is not yet understood.\"\nAccording to the Web site \"What's that bug?\", 2008 \"may bring a bumper crop of velvet ants.\"\n\"We have received many more reports than usual from people wanting to know \u2018What is this fuzzy red insect?'\" according to the Web site.\n\"The biggest problem with velvet ants is their capacity to sting pets and humans. If you are of the habit of walking barefooted in the grass during summer, you should be aware of velvet ants,\" said Bellinger, whose fellow scientist was severely stung in Central America. \"You may never see one, but if you do, don't panic! They are not aggressive like other wasps and will leave you alone if you leave them alone. They are really pretty cool. Look for them in open areas with sandy soil. Marvel at their muscular body, and rest assured that they are solitary, and you do not have to spray insecticide over your entire yard to kill their \u2018nest'.\"\nSpecimens velvet ants of found in the Dominican Republic preserved in fossil amber (tree resin) are said to be between 25 million and 40 million years old, according to the Smithsonian Natural Science Museum.\n\nNeed Help?

The koala bear isn\u2019t a bear at all; it\u2019s a marsupial. The firefly isn\u2019t a fly but a beetle. A killer whale isn\u2019t a whale, a nighthawk isn\u2019t a hawk, and the common trait that links crayfish, jellyfish and starfish is that none are actually fish. \n We all know where this is going. The red velvet ant isn\u2019t an ant; it\u2019s a wasp. The females do pretty good ant imitations, though. Three-quarters of an inch long and wingless, their black bodies tufted on the thorax and abdomen with dense orange-red hair, they look amazingly like very big ants. Differences like straight rather than elbowed antennae aren\u2019t enough to undo the deception.\nBut wasps they are, and, like other wasps, they can inflict repeated stings that pack enough wallop to spur their common nickname: cow killer.\nRed velvet ant -\r\n          Dasymutilla occidentalis \nDescription: 3/4 of an inch long, black with tufts of red/orange hair. Large and solitary. \nRange and Habitat: : Sandy open soils; fields, pastures; much of S.C.\nReproduction: Parasitoid, in that female lays eggs on host\u2014pupa of ground-nesting bee or wasp.\nViewing Tips: Sandy soils, particularly fields and pastures, can be especially promising.\n\n\u201cI had heard from others who had been stung by a velvet ant that \u2018it hurt so bad for about twenty to thirty minutes that I just wanted to die and get it over with,\u2019 \u201d  says Don Manley, professor emeritus at Clemson University. \u201cI had worked with them for over twenty years before I was finally stung. I concur with the above description. I have not been stung by a velvet ant since\u2014I will not be stung by a velvet ant again.\u201d \n Red velvet ants are not normally aggressive, and if their bright coloration doesn\u2019t warn away potential predators, they can produce a squeaky chirp also designed as a warning. If escape is impossible, though, they\u2019ll prove they\u2019re all wasp. Perhaps not surprisingly, Manley, whose work with velvet ants extends back forty years, has not found a single predator for the red velvet ant.\nIn this species, males look like females, with the addition of black wings and the absence of a stinger. Still, says Manley, \u201cThe males have an elaborate stinging behavior that\u2019s very convincing. It can certainly make you think you\u2019re being stung. I\u2019ve collected them, especially early in my career, and I\u2019ve let them go at times, thinking I was being stung.\u201d\nThe male\u2019s wings are used in seeking out mates, with both vision and pheromones thought to play a part. Both sexes produce the squeak during the mating process. \nFertilized females dig through the soil and lay eggs singly on the outside of the pupa or prepupa of a ground-nesting bee or wasp. The velvet ant\u2019s outer layer is tough enough to be resistant to the stings of the host wasp or bee. \n\u201cWhen the egg hatches,\u201d says Manley, \u201cthe velvet ant larva begins eating the host. Since the host is in a \u2018resting\u2019 stage, it has no defense.\u201d \nThe larvae pupate inside the host nest, growing to full size in a matter of days. Some emerge in summer, while others overwinter in a pupal state. \nThere are approximately 150 North American species of Dasymutilla, the genus of red velvet ants to which our red velvet ant, or Dasymutilla occidentalis, belongs, with most found from the desert Southwest through Mexico into Central America, and 10,000 species worldwide. Red velvet ants, found from Texas and Oklahoma through the Southern states and into New England, are loners and are generally found singly in open, sandy areas in most parts of South Carolina. They are diurnal and are most active when the temperature is between 70 and 96 degrees. \n\u201cWhile the species may not be the most common in South Carolina,\u201d Manley says, \u201cit is certainly the most conspicuous. When people talk about velvet ants, at least in the Southeast, that is the species to which most are referring.\u201d \nThis is, says Manley, \u201cone of the later-emerging species in South Carolina. I usually do not see them until at least late June, sometimes early July.\u201d They remain active until September or early October, and some dig into the ground to overwinter in a quiescent state. \nThe adults feed largely on nectar and so can often be found in pastures and fields. It\u2019s that proximity to domestic animals that gives them their common names of cow killer and mule killer. Manley, though, has not found an instance of a red velvet ant\u2019s sting being responsible for the death of an animal of any kind. That doesn\u2019t for a minute lessen his respect for their sting. \n\u201cI was being careful,\u201d he says, \u201cand the one that stung me just barely got me. But I\u2019ve worked with bees, ants and wasps my entire career, and I\u2019ve been stung many times by many different things, and nothing even comes close.\u201d \nHe reports, reassuringly enough, that there were no lasting effects, although the knot on his thumb lasted for the better part of a month. \nNothing in the sting has diluted his appreciation for a creature that is part of a group he finds \u201cfascinating.\u201d They\u2019re part of the natural landscape worth looking at more closely\u2014although with the respect their formidable defensive abilities merit. \n\u2014Rob Simbeck\nRob Simbeck is an award-winning free-lance writer  living in Nashville, Tennessee.\nSubscribe Now!\n\u00a9 2009 South Carolina Wildlife Magazine, July -

While they do appear to be velvety, they are wasps, not ants. Males can fly. Females are flightless because they do not have wings. Females can sting: males cannot. As for the cowkiller common name of this species, their sting is not potent enough to kill a cow; however, humans stung by this velvet ant experience such intense pain that they believe the sting could kill a cow.\nThey are no longer on display at the Aquarium.\nEastern US: New York to Florida. Western US: to Missouri, Texas, and Arizona\nThese velvet ants live in meadows, clover fields, at forest edges, and deserts.\nThe body of cowkiller ants consists of two parts, a thorax and abdomen. There is a slight constriction between the two. They have a hard exoskeleton that is shed periodically. Males have transparent black wings and females are wingless. Antennae are straight and beadlike. The thorax and abdomen of these wasps are red above and covered with short red hairs. The body below and the head are black.\nThe largest velvet ant species, cowkillers are 15-25 mm (0.6-1 in) long. Females are slightly larger than males.\nAdult cowkiller ants primarily feed on nectar but they will also eat larvae and adult insects, such as flies, beetles, bees, and other wasps.\nMales fly low over the ground searching for females that they find using sight and smell to detect the pheromones that females secrete.  After mating, females seek nesting chambers of bees and other wasps. The female velvet ant enters the host\u2019s nest, puncture\u2019s the host\u2019s cocoon, and lays one egg. When the egg hatches, the larvae feed on either the mature host larva or the pupa of the host.  Typical Ant Life Cycle \nVelvet ants seen walking on sand are all females. Those seen flying low over the ground are all males. This genus, unlike many other velvet ants that are nocturnal, is active from sunrise to sunset.\nFemale cowkillers have a very efficient and powerful stinging apparatus. The curved needle-like stinger concealed at the tip of the abdomen is nearly as long as their abdomen and because of its length and maneuverability it can be directed at quite an angle from the abdomen. They are able to sting multiple times.\nThe exoskeleton of these wasps is like an armor plate. It prevents water loss and also supplies protection form predators, especially from stings of host wasps in burrows that a nesting female is invading.\nCowkillers are not on the IUCN Red List or any lists maintained by US or state agencies. Usually they do not reach pest status, although they may occasionally invade residences.\nCalifornia has about 100 species of velvet ants, most of which are nocturnal and live in the desert.\n\n\nChinese | Espa\u00f1ol | Deutsch | Fran\u00e7ais | Japanese | Korean\n\nConnect with us on:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2014 Aquarium of the Pacific, a 501(c)3 organization | 100 Aquarium Way, Long Beach, CA 90802 (562) 590-3100\n"], ["Fuzzy Doesn't Mean Friendly: Red Velvet Ants | The ...", "http://www.thefeaturedcreature.com/fuzzy-doesnt-mean-friendly-red-velvet/", "\nIn case you couldn't tell already, I'm slightly obsessed with animals.

I had to catch it in a plastic bag, while I googled it & showed everyone! It was hissing and/or buzzing at me!\nYes they have a very hard exoskeleton  and let off pheromone when they are agitated so if you can avoid them please do , I don\u2019t know if they live in a hive or colony but don\u2019t handle them around other ones  when you kill them you spread their pheromones about  so if you can just avoid them , I was at fort Benning sand hill area on FTEx  and picked one up with gloved hand it made noises and I watched it\u2019s stinger go into my glove about thirteen times in the seven or eight seconds I held it.

Good teaching moment with the kids.  Treat them with respect.\nSaw one in the parking lot outside my office today. Never seen anything like it. Thanks for the info.. kinda cool.\nI\u2019ve seen them hanging around Cicada Killer nest burrow colonies.  I\u2019ve read they deposit their eggs on the Cicada Killer larvae.  Cicada Killers are pretty scary looking but seem to be for the most part non-aggressive.  \nI like your site\u2026   Thanks!\nI live in Riverview, FL and have for 38 yrs. In that time I only came across 5.  But in the last 3 weeks we have come across 6 in our yard. Only one got away but we actually had to chop the others in half to kill them. Nothing we tried first worked. We tried grinding it into the ground with our foot, bug spray (and we drowned it in it, trust me)and finally chopped it with a shovel. Is there any way to safeguard your yard? I have a 5 yr old.\nHi, I\u2019m the girl from Riverview and i had to let anyone who reads this know that I\u2019m an extreme animal and nature lover. I\u2019m very allergic to honey bees but I always save any that I find in our pool because i know their integral part in our food chain, but the sting from a red velvet ant is extremely painful and can sometimes cause death,so being a person with an insect allergy and a young child who also has an insect allergy, I have to unfortunately choose to kill them when we see them.  I just needed to clarify that. And I have to let you know this is the first time I have ever read ANYONE\u2019S blog and it is just incredible.  Thank you so much for your time and effort. Planning to join your followers.\nFound one in Louisville, KY. Took me 5 times stepping on it to finally get it to stop running. This dude (or female after reading this) is a straight up bad a$$\u2026.\nI live in Charlotte, NC.  I have 15+ years as a Pest Control Technician.  I would occasionally see these ants usually one or two at a time.  About a year ago I saw about a hundred of them.  They were swarming an odorous house ant nest.  They were everywhere.  It was pretty awesome since my customer was having a serious odorous house ant infestation.\nwhere in the world do they be running to? Every time i see one its in a hurry, got an appointment? They have amazed me for 30 years\u2026\nSaw a ton of those while growing up in South Louisiana.  They\u2019re not that aggressive, but if you accidentally touch them, the sting is very painful, as I was unfortunate to find out as a child.  If you are allergic, I suppose that they would be dangerous, but other than that, just painful.\nWe live in southern California and saw one on a hike yesterday.  we didnt know what it was so we took a picture and posted to FB and the concensus was that it wa this guy.\nGreat photo! We also were on a hike today in So. Calif. near the beach and saw one of these \u201cants\u201d. Third photo from the top is exactly the species we saw. So surprised to find out that it is actually a wasp and can cause an allergic reaction! I have big time allergies and am now going to stay away from these creatures. Thanks so much for the photo. Never would have known what it was! What are they doing in California??? I\u2019ve lived here all my life and this is the first one I\u2019ve ever seen!\nI\u2019m doing a project on them do you guys know what their role in  food chain is?

First ones I have ever seen and I am a native of the area.\nSaw one when I took my chihuahua right now! Scared me to death I\u2019ve never seen one in my life till now!!!\nAs of today, I can verify that Fort DeSoto Beach, FL has at least one.  It looked exactly like the fourth picture.  From what I have read it was probably laying eggs in the larvae in ground nests.  I saw one as a kid in Lutz, Florida and I saw one in Madeira Beach, Florida a few years ago.  It is always interesting the things we learn when we take the time to be observant.\nWe have several in our back yard in Sacramento, CA.\nSaw two \u2013 one male and one female.  I live in Evans Georgia and noticed a bug flying around nervously.  He was black and good size wasp but not big.  I then noticed a big red ant with black stripes (at least I thought it was an ant).  The male was flying around her.  I got my phone out to take a picture and tried to take a picture of her \u2013 at the same time he landed on her.  The picture was a little fuzzy \u2013 I wonder why!  Anyway after he was done she brushed herself off and continued on her way.  My pictures of her looked exactly as the ones above.   John\ni just saw this thing running around in my front yard! I just sent my one year old in the house! I stepped on this thing atleast 6 or 7 times and it kept on moving in a hurry!

I\u2019ve really enjoyed reading all your comments and the experiences you\u2019ve had with these curious wasps. Please keep documenting your encounters for me (and the rest of us)!  \nFound one in Terre Haute Indiana, never saw them here before and I usually keep an eye out for that sort of thing.\nSaw one last week on our back porch in Fairview, TN.  Never knew what they were (have seen 3 or 4 in my 42 years).  Thanks for the blog!  I love that I can always turn to the internet to get an answer!\nI was camping in eastern Tennessee a few years back and was stung by one.  It felt like fire.  I cant remember ever experiencing anything that hurt like that.  And I have been stung by wasps and bees.  The pain was intense for about one minute then quickly subsided.  Avoid them if you can.\nI found one yesterday in my mothers yard. In Hickman County Tennessee. I had never seen one before and we found one more today. Is there any way you can kill these things?\nGet cowboy boots and step on them with the heel multiple times. At least that\u2019s what I did haha. Took me 7 times with the heel and finally I just pressed on its head hard with the toe and killed it.\nI found one in my pool today and tried drowning it for about 5 mins and it didn\u2019t work! Then i tried to step on it, didn\u2019t work! Then I cut it in half with a shovel and finally it died!!! I have looked at some pics on the Internet and have found out it was a male. I hate those things!!!!! Sorry that\u2019s just my opinion  \nWow i just freaked out my son just got stung by one i was glad to find this to make sure they werent poisonous! Thank u!!!\nI saw one in my backyard today so I googled it and found this blog.  I have never seen anything like this before and it looked scary!  I live in Roseville, Ca.  I hope I don\u2019t see anymore but I\u2019m going to have an exterminator come out anyways.\nWe found one in my flower bed in Sioux City IOWA!  I have never seen or heard of these before!  When we saw it I guessed it was some kind of wasp because of the size and body shape.  But I googled giant red and black ant and found this and other sources of info.  First I find that they don\u2019t live in colonies but then I see on here that people are finding several of them at a time.  Also everyone who is posting lives in a warm climate(year round). I live in IOWA, how common sre these here.  Also when I saw it, sprayed it with wasp nest foam, didn\u2019t check to see if that killed it, but after reading some of these post I am nervous that it didn\u2019t die.  What should I do if it is still out there or if I see more?  I have small children that I do not want to end up stung by this thing!\nI live in Augusta, GA. I saw one something running across my driveway today. I went to go go see what it was, and found of these guys crawling around like a hunting dog on the trail of a prey. Like others, I tried spraying bug killer and stepping on it with no success. It keep going. I finally had to cut it in half to kill it too. It would be scary to have a swarm of these things coming your way.\nI just found one on my driveway.  I put a jar over it because I wanted to see it close-up.  It curled up and is still in the jar on my front porch.  I am waiting for it to die before I open the jar to look at it.  I guess I will be careful to not get stung.  I live in Ellettsville, Indiana.  Not usually a warm climate but it has been a very hot summer.  Wonder if that is what is bringing them to the central US. We also have several cicada killers in our yard.\nHi i live in texas , i saw one in my yard .

Now we have several males that are flying about, but they are definitely not aggressive which is a good thing!!\nJust saw one while I was cleaning around my pool. We have a very \u201csandy\u201d yard in Central VA. First time I have ever seen one. Trying to decide if I should have killed it.\nI\u2019m in Kansas and have killed two in the past week.  Both female.  They are fast!!!  The first one I stepped on four or five times before it died.  The second one we caught in a ziplock bag and froze so we could get a better view.

We were getting out of her car that she parked in the street and walking around to the rear of var to get the groceries out.  I looked down and said \u201cWHAT THE BLEEP IS THAT\u201d, she didn\u2019t know either.  It was running quickly away from us as she was trying to gently step on it so we could ask her husband.  Needless to say, it crawled between a decent size crack in the curb and we couldn\u2019t find it.  I am glad I tried an Internet search and found out what SHE was.  We asked my neighbors husband and he has seen one before, 10 yrs ago. YIKES!\nLocust Grove, Georgia, Thanks for all the info I just captured one of these in the backyard when I put my little dog out. I read the info on this little varmit and it made me a little nervous because I am highly allergic to hornets, plus my dog likes to lay in the sunshine. I have seen these a few times on my front porch but never seen one this big. I am fixing to go treat the yard, thank you all for your post, got some great info here.\nMy daughter and I saw one of these in the backyard. We cur it in half. It sounds like that what the right decicsion.\nWe just caught the female (red and black). The male (blue and black) is still flying around. We are in Western Colorado.

I was hiking up at the top of our mountain where there are huge sand stone rocks. I saw this beautiful very smart extremely fast (almost on crack, fast) I was amazed by this little critter. She was to fast to get a good picture of her. And she was not having any of me trying to check her out. I thought she was a kind of stink bug. She had a big butt and put it high up. I saw no stinger. Glad I was ballsy enough to pick her up! Thank you for the info. I will keep a good distance if I ever see one again.\nI saw a very large red and black ant with no hair in Chestertown, MD. It was about 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 inches long. Could this be a red velvet ant? I can\u2019t seem to find any info on ants larger than 3/4 of an inch with no hair.

A week ago we found two seperate cicada killer nests in our back yard, now we have seen 3 female red velvet ants in the last two days. I have never seen either of these insects in all my 35 yrs living in very rural areas. I discovered what they both were from information on the internet. They both freak me out.\nGot one locked up in Nixa Missouri ..\nI\u2019ve seen 2 in the last 2 days in western CO\nI have been seeing them at our work place in Delaware the last 2 weeks. Boy are they fast, big and they have a long stinger. One of the guys caught one and the stinger came out. Stay away. Guess the warm hot weather is bringing them North.\nYep, that\u2019s her! We live in Stevensville, Maryland. Never saw one before but she was in the garden by our front door when I came home a bit ago. Not much of a bug person but have to admit that she really was kinda pretty with a fire engine red body and black stripe. I didn\u2019t kill her but might have to revisit that idea if she hangs around. I\u2019m not going to be too keen to work in that garden!\nI live in Ocean County, New Jersey\u2026. just came upon my encounter.. thought it was a giant ant\u2026.Are these dangerous to pets and humans\nI just read this from another site & wanted to share\u2026.. apparently they are on the lower northern east coast\u2026 ie NJ. & I did here it sqeak\u2026 OMG this is horrible.\nThe Cow Killer is a solitary wasp and does not live in a colony or have a nest of her own.  She is not aggressive and will try to escape if disturbed.  Interestingly, she does have a voice.  As a child, I would touch one with a twig just to hear the tiny squeak it made.  These beautiful wasps are not numerous and cause no damage to plants. No chemical control is needed.  Teach others about them, appreciate them, and leave them alone as they have a purpose in keeping the bee and wasp population in check.  My advice: Simply defend yourself against a painful sting and wear shoes in the garden.\nRives, TN\u2026.just saw 5 big ones while watering my banana trees! You can\u2019t kill them!\nEvansville, Indiana- My husband found one today while at a customers house, he\u2019s a cable tech, said he stepped on it like 5 times on the ground and it just got back up and walked away. He kicked it over to the sidewalk and stomped it and it curled up, he picked it up with a pair of needle nosed pliers to look at it closer. It was still alive,  he put it back on sidewalk and ground it into the concrete to finally kill it.

This year there has been over a dozen spotted in the last month at the house \u2013 all were smashed and split.

I really hope I don\u2019t see any more!\nI had my first ever encounter with the critter in Loganville, GA. Its bright color and fast movement surprised me! I was barefooted too! Yikes. But I did manage to get a couple of pictures before it hurried off into the grass.\nAdd Oklahoma to the list! We have found 2 in the last couple of weeks on the back porch near our pool, too.  Very scary-looking\u2026.hope the kids don\u2019t get stung by these suckers\u2026.we already have enough winged-stinger-creatures around!\ni live in westphalia, indiana and i just seen two in my back yard in the past month (red velvet ant), my yard is sandy in nature.     if anybody can give anymore info on these things i would love to hear about it .

They are unusual beautiful creatures. Seen one twice now in pool area in Hot Springs Village, Arkansas. It was 106 degrees today and this little gal seemed to be trying very hard to squeeze through the molding around our back door to get into the air conditioning. The RED looks scary\u2026beautiful from a distance. Glad they don\u2019t have wings. I can move faster than them even if I am almost 60!\nAdd Kentucky to the list also. Was mowing yard two day\u2019s ago, started to get off the lawn mower,looked down and there was this beutiful bright red ant (or so I thought)with black stripes. Never had seen one in all my 54 yrs. Glad I wasn\u2019t barefooted !!!\nSidell Illinois (East Central part of the state) has had three sightings this past week and the local weekly newspaper was researching to find out about this insect and came across this sight so there will be a story in this week\u2019s issue about this unusual insect which seems to new to this part of the state.\nYes! Saw one here in Evansville, Ind., too.  I am 43 and have never seen one of these in my lifetime \u2014 looked like something you would see in the tropics. I must say, however, that it was likely easier yo spot, as we have had severe drought which has the grass brown and short, making this insect more visible. Oh, it\u2019s also been in the 100s here for several weeks in July.\nThank you for this blog. I tried taking a pic of this fairly long red an black \u201cant\u201d at my work in Frankfort, Ky.. Of course the little critter was faster than my camera so I decide to google red and black insects and found this. Glad to know what it is and hopefully if I see another one I\u2019ll be ready to snap some pics. Must be the heat bringing them out cause in 43 yrs of being an insect watcher this is my first. I\u2019ve also noticed a ton of Robber Flies this year\u2026\nJust Saw my first one today in Central Conn.\nconsidering that they crawl on the ground and are so easily seen, I see no real reason to kill this beautiful insect.  especially when you consider that they lay their eggs in the nest of other bees\u2026 like say yellow jackets and the egg feeds on the larva found there.  I think they may do us more good than harm.  Just thought I would throw that out there for those who are allergic to bee stings.  I would personally much rather deal w/ this wasp than deal w/ the bees that it kills.\nMy friend just found two in atco NJ!\nI have lived in East Tennessee all my life (50 yrs) and I saw my first Red Velvet ant yesterday\u2026had never seen anything like it so I caught it in a glass jar.  Sure am glad I decided not to touch it!  Isn\u2019t it strange that so many people have seen their first one this past year?  Do you think the mild winters have anything to do with it?  Didn\u2019t want to kill it so I put it into my garbage and the garbage truck took it away a while later.  Maybe it can live a long happy life at the dump\u2026not in my yard!\nJust found one outside in my backyard in Indianapolis, IN.\nSaw my first one today near Roanoke VA. A pretty female running around in the newly tilled part of the garden. My son and I thought it was a large ant and luckily new that red on black is natures warning when it comes to insects. We didn\u2019t kill it hopefully, she\u2019ll stay in the garden and not bother us.\nPlaying golf near Front Royal, Va and saw one for the first time ever.  Didn\u2019t know what it was until a friend of mine caught me messing with it.  I stopped once he called.it a cow killer and smashed it into the dirt.  But before that I was fooled by its beauty.\nJust found one in virgilina virginia crawling around in the front yard it was neat looking and figured I would find out what we were looking at\nAnother for Ky we are just south of Louisville. My husband found one near  our childrens pool. We had never seen anything like it, thanks for the ID. Another reason to keep shoes on the kids even just going back and forth to the pool.\nHave seen several in last few years in western ky. Thought they were some type of ant.\nWow. I just found one of these female creatures. I was very cautious. Being the bright color. I found a jar to capture it. (VERY CAREFULLY) I instantly went to the web for identification. I have never seen anything like this. Very cool. It was hard to get in the jar. Kept running away.\nI had two to appear in my driveway/garage in Clinton, Hickman County, KY.  I\u2019ve never seen anything like it before.  Glad to find out they aren\u2019t poisonous, but they sure looked like large red velvet ants.  I\u2019d never have guessed they were actually wasps.  Glad to find this info on them.  I feel better knowing what they are.  Must have been brought to the USA from abroad; like I think a lot of things do.  They are hard to kill.  I stepped on them several times and when I\u2019d take my foot off them, they\u2019d take off again\u2026persistent little dudes.\nI\u2019ve seen at least three around my backyard in Terre Haute, IN this past month.  Makes sense because we have 4 very determined cicada killers digging nests along and under our privacy fence.  Have been trying to deter them but am loosing the battle.  Will likely leave them be and let nature take it\u2019s course.\njust found one here in maysville ky on 8/8/2012 at 3:20 pm now the real question is the one i found a scout  or a solider it looks dead on the last pic with the black strip on its back\nSon just got stung by one.  Never seen ones of these before in Brazil, Indiana. Thanks for the information.\nwe have them here around the Paducah Kentucky area. I just had to look up and see what they are. isn\u2019t the Internet great.\nJust found a red and black female in the yard in Bement, Illinois.  Interesting creatures, but I sure wouldn\u2019t want to end up on the receiving end of one of their stings!\nOnce just bit me while mowing. It is true. It hurts very badly.\nI was walking my dog and from some reason he was trying to chase something I couldn\u2019t see. He damn near choked himself. When I saw what it was I was moving so fast I forgot I had him.  This would be the 2nd time I\u2019ve seen one.  Now I know what it is. My husband thought I was crazy and thought we were running from a ladybug.  Not crazy here in Richmond, VA.\nJust got one to craw into a water bottle so I could look it up, and sure never though it was a wasp. seen about 10 \u2013 15 in my life out on the back path in the field but never in the yard. This is after a bumble bee pick me to chase down and sting\u2013this also never has happen, and I have bees all over the place\nObserved 1\u2033 female in my yard today.Concord, NC\nWe live in Western Virginia (near Harrisonburg) and have seen two in our yard, one of which we have kept as a \u201cpet\u201d for 3 weeks now.  I read that they have been seen in eastern VA for 3 or 4 years, but no one I have spoken to here had seen one before.\nThey seem to be more active now than in past years.  spotted one for the first time in 36 years in atlanta, GA.  Wonder if colony collapse disorder among the bee populations is leading to their recent activity?\nAs far as I know, they have no predators.  They lay their eggs in ground wasp larvae.  So they actually help keep down the population of ground wasps (I guess that would be yellow jackets?).\nTwo recently in Aldie, VA. That is Northern Virgina.\nI\u2019m from NJ, and have seen 2 in 2 days, this thing is massive for a little thing.\nI\u2019m from NJ, and have seen 2 in 2 days, this thing is massive for a little thing.\nI\u2019m from NJ, and have seen 2 in 2 days, this thing is massive for a little thing.\nHere in Knoxville TN, just found one like in the third pic.  We have a river bordering our back yard and she was on the boat dock.  She is now headed south on the river towards Chattanooga (I hope). \nGreat site and comments btw.\nI also live in Knoxville and saw my first one yesterday on the porch.\nI don\u2019t know about them not living in colonies. I\u2019d never seen one until camping this weekend at Harmonie State Park in So. Indiana. Between the 4 of us we saw at least 6 at our campsite and the adjacent playground.  The park director said a girl was still limping a week after being bitten by one!\nSaw one today in Richmond Va. Sorry I didn\u2019t kill it. Know better next time.\nYou do not need to kill it\u2026it\u2019s not going to attack you.\nSaw one today, she was beautiful and I went to get my camera to get a picture but that quickly she was gone. Never seen one before and I have lived in many states. I live in Earleville Maryland now and that is where I saw it. Thanks for the info. I will be alert to them but not kill them, but then that is just me. I appreciate the beauty of them. I look forward to seeing another.\nMe n my dad were outside when we saw One of these\u2026 My cat decided to chase it so we caught it.. Not knowing what it was we took pictures n stuff\u2026we jumped n stepped on it n It wouldn\u2019t die\u2026 We eventually killed it\u2026we think\u2026so are these poisonious in any way If I do not have allergys?\nStevensville on the Eastern Shore of Maryland-I saw a few last year-and now they are back again this year\u2026glad I know now that it\u2019s really a wasp-terribly allergic to bees and wasps-so I will be keeping my distance-they are very quick and always look like they are in a hurry to do something-but they are kind of neat looking..I also thought they were just GIANT ants..your blog is Great by the way!!\nJust caught me a female red here in Mew Plymouth Idaho.  I have never seen one of these and I have lived in several states. Thanks for the info. \nKilled two this week here in Southeastern Virginia. Never seen them before so we looked it up. Everyone is correct, they are not easy to kill and they do make a squeaky noise. YIKES\nMy kids caught one in a cup that our puppy was chasing today in Branson, MO b/c they did not know what it was and did not want n e one to get hurt.  So I came and googled to find out thanks for the info and I love your blog and all the info Thank you\nAdd Eads, TN to the list of sitings. (Memphis). Seen many this summer.\nWell there here in Prince George County, Virginia too!!!Saw the Red Velvet the day before yesterday, I guess it would scsre just about anyone, when you see one for the first time. I\u2019m glad that they aren\u2019t endangered.\nwe just saw 2 of these creatures on my front step, I have never seen or heard of them before and I have lived here on the eastern shore of Maryland all of my life.One of them looked like she was trying to get through the glass door to get to the cat.\nWe live in a small town in Virginia called Saltville, got to see one of these at our store wasn\u2019t sure what it was until I google it and found out what it could do, scary I wish now I would of killed it! Does anyone have a picture or where I can go and see the male? If I see this little lady again, she will be cut in half, sorry little lady but I have grandchildren!!\nTell your grandchildren not to touch insects.\nI live in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, about and hour and 15 mins outside of Denver. I have NEVER seen one of these in my 26 years of living in CO and almost 20 yrs in the mountains until this morning. I took my dog out and suddenly saw a female crawling around the ground. I thought it looked like a red furry bee without wings, and low and behold, that\u2019s almost what it is! Super cool to see this wasp, and I will definitely be looking for them again as it hid in some dense grass patches before I could get a pic. If there was any doubt in my mind about global weather patterns changing there isn\u2019t anymore. I have seen several strange bugs that I have never seen before this year, all in my yard. One night I found a glow worm that shone as bright as a neon green light stick, just hanging out in the grass at almost midnight. I couldn\u2019t figure out what the little speck of light was, it was bright and about 50 feet away on the side of the mtn. I hiked over there and found what looked like a meal worm with a super bright glowing head. We have also had lots of ticks, which we have never had before \u2013 had to get tick medication for my puppy for the first time. Even the vet said there\u2019s been bunches of tick infestations this year, but never had a problem with them for the 30+ years of business before now.Anyway, thank you so much for posting this information, it can be really hard trying to find out what specific bugs are if you don\u2019t already know their names, I will definitely be bookmarking you so I can keep coming back  \nJust saw one crawling across my livingroom floor behind my two kids, my husband caught it and flushed it down the drain, now that I read this\u2026. She make be back for revenge, lol.  Egg harbor city, nj\nI live in Knoxville, TN I saw my first one yesterday on my porch. A friends grandson had told us about them but have never seen one. I about died when I saw it come up on the porch where I always sit.\nJenks, Oklahoma\u2026just southwest of Tulsa. Saw this for first time near my front walkway. Lived in Oklahoma all my life and have never seen one! Looked up giant black and red and google filled in fuzzy ant, lol. We live on seven acres and have lots of critters who live here with us. Glad to be able to show my kiddos do they can steer clear. We won\u2019t be killing any since I\u2019m sure they have a job to do in the big picture. Thanks for the blog. Very interesting !\nAdd Nevada Texas to the list as well.  I have never seen such a thing. It was actually very pretty. Bright red velvety little creature but knew to stay away from it.   Let\u2019s just say red means stop\u2026,, right!!!\nJust saw one come across my driveway in Bristow, VA and it was making a beeline for the garage.  Wasn\u2019t sure what it was  but I didn\u2019t want it in the house so I was able to step on it and kill it.  Then I came here and found out what it was.  Good thing I did since I am allergic to wasps and bee stings.  I will have to make sure my little one doesn\u2019t run around without shoes in the yard.  It is a beautiful creature though and I would have left it alone if it was heading the other way or far enough from the house.\nHave just noticed this interesting insect here in Dillon, S.C. the past couple of days. Never seen one before now. Just curious why they are so abundant.\nWe have these in N.KY. They are very hard to kill by just stepping on them on gravel or grass. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it.Ziggy\nI live in O\u2019Fallon Ill.I saw one last week on my patio and didn\u2019t think anything of it. I saw one again this morning in my yard,I hope it was the same one. Jeff\nWe have a ton of these in Remington, VA.  My kitten was trying to catch one and it about gave me a heart attack.  Does anyone know the effect they have on animals, for instance, I have horses, ducks, dogs and cats.  I have also seen bright green ones here any information on these?\nI live is SC and have seen about 6 of theseants this summer. The funny thing is, themale has wings and flies. I saw one in flightand have killed several in my yard. I havegrandkids and although they are unique Idon\u2019t want them to get stung. The only wayI\u2019ve killed them is cut them in half. I sprayed bug killer on one and it took foreverto die. I would think young children wouldtry to pick it up or a pet to catch it so BEWare OF THEM\nSaw one in Williamsburg, VA. Left it alone, no reason to kill it.\nfound one in south eastern indiana, right on the ohio border.  bugs are fast!\nMy son is doing a bug collection for 7th grade science.  We are from Syracuse NY and spent a week in Orlando.  Thought it would be cool to have him collect a bug (or try to!) At each states welcome area along the way.  Anyhow we caught 2 of these, I am presuming are females due to the lack of wings, at the South Carolina welcome center.  1 is small, but the other is HUGE!  I also thought they were ants at first until my wife found this page.  Thanks for the info!\nfrom Eliz. City, NCHave never seen this creature in all my 65+ years. Found 1 in my back yard last week, and 1 in my front yard today.Does the sting of this wasp leave a black necrotic spot in the center like the brown recluse spider? Got a really nasty sting from something unseen while mowing around trees in the front yard.  Felt like a \u201cswitch\u201d hitting my arm.\nI found one yesterday  on my back porch.  Tried to step on it in flip flops. Glad I didnot catch her.  Memphis, Indiana\nJust had a student help me squash one in the high school library in Ashland, MO.  They ARE hard to kill.  One student told me he thought it was a fire ant so we thought we probably should take care of it.  I\u2019m glad we finished her off.\nseen one yesterday here in va in my yard ,never seen one in my 59 years of life,,pretty\nMy husband just saw one in our front yard when cutting grass.  Kings Mountain, NC\nFound one in seaville NJ, awesome, ran fast but I got a good photo,\njust saw one for the first time in my life in central VA. I said to my self, \u201cgeez, that ant is the color of red velvet\u201d. Then I came in the house and found your site!\nJust saw my first one ever this morning on my patio in northern VA.  Very pretty but a little scary!  Definitely looks like red velvet and moved VERY quickly.  Not knowing what it was and because I have a dog that is outside a lot, I stepped on it.  It took several good stomps to kill it.\nPetersburg, WV. I have an infestation. There are countless numbers of them and for days I tried stepping on/burning/drowning them, basically anything I could think of. I have finally discovered their weakness and I am thinning them down now. It\u2019s a .22 Caliber pistol with ratshot. Expensive but fun and effective.\nI have seen two red velvets in my yard in Elkton, MD.  Glad to know what they are but they are not welcome in my yard.  This has been a terrible year for bees, wasps and yellow jackets of all kinds.\nIf you have yellow jacket problems, you WANT to have red velvet ants.  They lay their eggs in the larva of ground wasps.  So, they are essentially reducing the yellow jacket population.\nI found one of them here in my front yard. I live in Missouri.\nFound one last week on my back porch. Saw it again today (hopefully the same one!!!) next time I see it may be the last!! Looks like they\u2019re moving in and up because I\u2019m in central Illinois (Decatur). My daughters sand box is on the back porch. Should I be concerned that they could possibly be in the sand?\nHigginsville, MO.  I have seen at least 4 or 5 every summer for the last 3 years.  They really give me the Heebie Jeebies.  I had no clue they are wasps.  This have been a very helpful website.  Thank you.\nSaw my first one ever today while visiting Fort Caroline National Monument in Jacksonville, Fl. My wife said she found one in our yard at Ft Stewart, Ga. Beautiful looking bug.\nI have seen 5 of theese in the past week. 4 in the yard and one on the driveway. First time in my life as well. live in Bright, Indiana\nI live in Georgetown, Indiana  about 20 minutes west of Louisville, Ky. I always see these mainly running across my asphalt driveway and had always wondered what they were. I had cought them numerous times in a baby food jar and watched them for a few hours then turned them loose. My children especially think they are pretty but I have warned them not to touch.\nHere in Albemarle N.C. also.Seen one several weeks back they seem to like dark areas.Today I caught one as I had never seen one before.This sight is great just wish someone knew what they eat ,are they destructive,will they harm our pets?\nI have found only one of these little guys the past 4-7 years in Southern Alberta Canada.\nJust saw our first in Dickson, TN about three weeks ago, but since that time we\u2019ve seen two more and killed all of by stepping on them and grinding and twisting down on them.  Does anyone have any concrete info on why they are suddenly here in these numbers?? Mild winters; armadillo invasion; hay brought in from other areas due to drought?\nDo not kill them.  Let them carry on with their business.  They will not attack you.\nPlease don\u2019t kill this creature. Think about it. It needs the eggs of yellow jackets and other ground nesting bees for food for its own larvae to survive. As such, it wouldn\u2019t be around in your yard unless THOSE were around. It is natures way of controlling those pests!!.\namen!\nKill them when you see them, don\u2019t want one to sting your kids.\nMy 5 year old grandson got bit two times on his inter bye need to know what to do.\nI\u2019d never seen such a thing in my life! \u2026until today! A playdate at a local park found a few of us moms \u2026I mean \u201cour kids\u201d \u2026 catching what we thought to be a NEW, mysterious creature! lol \u2026glad to see it isn\u2019t some deadly, \u201cbotfly-esque\u201d insect carried back from a foreign country \u2013 which, embarrassingly enough, is actually what we had concluded. I must say the research has been interesting!! Forest, Virginia : you never cease to amaze me!! =)\nCaught a beautiful female in UT. It squeaked loudly like a rubber ducky squeak toy when we disturbed it with the edge of a paper.It squeaks loudly when blown upon. It is amazing the variety of patterns and colors. Second one this week; the first all orange, and smaller. This one is the largest I\u2019ve ever seen with a black tapering base to the fuzzy orange-red abdomen. It is definitely not aggressive, (unlike the camel spiders)and just tried to stay out of the way, making picture taking difficult. We were glad to know it wasn\u2019t poisonous. I saw these many times as I growing up\u2013 through several western states. I was never harmed, and my children love to see them. We are just careful to keep a respectful distance.\nIm pretty sure they smoke camel non-filters, and wield switchblade knifes. These bugs are bad-azz little dudes. Kudos to the guy who uses a .22 on them\u2026 AWESOME!! sounds like daddy\u2019s got a good reason for a new gun for christmass.\nWhen I was about 8, I touched one of these velvet ants\u2013well, because it was fuzzy and red and cool looking. Wow! What a shock. Yes, I\u2019m a guy.\nI lived in Zuni, VA and as a kid I use to play with these guys all the time they are some cool looking bugs never knew they were wasp tho!?!?\nCaught one today near Palm Springs\u2026just moved here last year, we always lived in cooler places in So Cal before, and have never seen one of these beautiful fuzzy scarey bugs!!  \nThanks for info\u2026I threw it over the fence since we do have wasps and a few too may bees..so I guess nature sent her to help out.\nI rarely kill anything ( except rattlers and black widows) I always talk to a spider if uncertain\u2026roll over and show me if you are a black widow or not..Yes they do and I spare the non red hour-glassed bellied ones..just sayin\u2019\nI heard they were called cow-killers because cows sometimes swallowed them by accident and suffocated from the horrible throat-stings. o_o\nThey\u2019re the only wasps I think are pretty, though.\nJust saw one in Pasadena, CA\u2026\nSaw one in Ridgeville, SC at the state park!  Scary!\nI saw one of these yesterday . I was unloading car turned around to go in and there on the ground was something I\u2019d never in my life seen before . I at first thought wow What is that?  a new creature , lol . It was moving so fast though just a going across driveway , well in the freak moment I thought well ill just step on it n Smush it , had sandals on at that , well stepped on and it didn\u2019t kill it. I had my hands full of stuff and looked down and was like you have to be kidding me I stepped on that bug . Well I stepped again it was like a sponge \u2013 n to note I\u2019m not tiny ( medium ) sized lady . I stepped again and again , and finally decided to step and drag down . I looked to see if this had killed it , well it had separated it for sure but part of it was still moving I couldn\u2019t believe it ! So today after speaking to family about someone mentioned it and I decided to look and sure enough thanks to your pictures and notes \u2013 I realize I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t get stung for sure . Thanks for your page . This was in Travelers Rest , S.C.\nDon\u2019t kill them\u2026.let them carry on.  They\u2019re not going to attack you.\nHad one running across the driveway do live in a wooded area pool next door but do have lots of wasps under deck \u2013 agin as I\u2019ve read and had already discovered at first to my surprise after stomping a few ones it wouldn\u2019t die I was like what the heck n it is fast ! I wish I wouldn\u2019t have now I read this though I don\u2019t want anyone stung \u2013 I knew if never seen one but was in a hurry n didn\u2019t want it to get away \u2013 I stomped again n dragged my foot across pavent \u2013 then looked \u2013 well the head part was still moving \u2013 I wish now I wouldn\u2019t have killed . I don\u2019t see hardley anyone from South Carolina \u2013 I live in Travelers  Rest .\nThis bugger caused quite a stir tonight.  I have never seen one before or heard of them.  I live in Albuquerque, NM where we get some other odd desert critters, but this was a new one.  It was crawling up my sisters leg while we were sitting on the couch watching TV.  I took pictures and posted it on various FB sites \u2013  finally a friend identified it.  I tried whacking it with a shoe numerous time, but it kept going and going.   Any recommendations to prevent future ones in or out around the house?   Thanks\nI do not think you should have a problem with them coming in the house.  That was probably a rare occurrence.  The best thing to do is capture it with a cup or something, then set it free.  There are not a lot of this type of insect anyway.  They are not like ant and bee populations.\nHoly cow alright! I just saw one in Mt Pleasant, SC. It was moving so fast I couldn\u2019t even take picture. I figured it was not nice so I freaked when I thought it crawled up my stroller. Then I saw it so far away. So fast! I have never seen one before. Something that pretty can\u2019t be nice! Lol\nI saw one of these red & black bugs in my yard in Fayetteville n. c.  I was playing with it. I\u2019ll play with any animal, bug, snake, etc. It didn\u2019t bite me. Then I put it back on it\u2019s merry little way.\nJust saw one of these scurry across the patio headed for the tomato plants.  Never seen one in my whole life and we spend a lot of time outdoors!  Decided to look it up and found that it was a \u201cred velvet ant\u201d.  Seems pretty scary to me.  Now knowing what I know, I wish I would have killed it.  We live in Bargersville, IN, about 15 miles south of Indianapolis.\nYou don\u2019t need to kill it.  There are not tons of them like other bees or ants anyway.  The best thing to do is to let them go on their merry way\u2026\nCaught one today at work. Thought it was an ant and was surprised to find out it really is a wasp. Good thing i didn\u2019t just pick it up \nGoogle\u2019d it then let it go in the field outside. I have to say in reading some of the comments above it is an impressive creature.\nOyea, Sacramento Ca is where I am.\njust saw one of these critters in my driveway, strange thing is that I\u2019m in N.J. since when do we have a tropical \u201cant\u201d Wasp up here kinda freaked out. Also it took me 5 stomps to kill this beast , and im not a small guy ,my wife felt the vibrations of my stomps on our cement driveway. There tough little creatures that can hurt, I\u2019m happy my daughter didd\u2019nt come across this thing and get stung.\nThey are not going to seek you out to sting you.  The best thing to do is let the velvet ant to carry on with its business and not bother it.\nI\u2019ve seen these for 60 over years in North West Louisiana.  Today while watching my bee hive one just about an inch long crawled up the leg of the hive stand and tried to enter the hive.  One bee confronted the thing and threw it onto the ground.  In short order ole red velvet found a new direction to go.  The bee was about a third the size of the wasp.  Go Bees !  lol\nMy dad just found and caught 1 here in North Delaware.\nBeautiful bug but definitely glad I read up on them.\nHe almost picked it up with his bare hands.\nWow, a wasp!  Learn something new every day!  I have spotted several of these running around and had to do some research.  I live in NE Texas (July).\nJust found one in Mountain Home Arkansas.. Little buggar was fast and wasn\u2019t phased by my Ortho Home Defense bug spray! \nI saw one of these today crawling on a large rock. I was going to take a picture but it was moving pretty fast and got away. I haven\u2019t seen one until today. Are they supposed to be in north florida? (thats where I saw it)\nJust saw one of these things crawling across my deck while i was working from home.  Freaked me out!!!!  He crawled in a crack between the boards on my deck.  Now that I\u2019ve read about it, I\u2019m scared to let my feet touch the deck!!!  LOL  When I have to get up to go into the house, I make sure to walk ON the boards and not let my feet touch the cracks.\nOh, I\u2019m in Tennessee just north of Nashville. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever seen one around my home.\nI\u2019m in TN and have seen them all my life.  They are nothing to be afraid of.  They will not attack you or seek you out.  If anything, they will run from you or just go about their normal business.\nI\u2019m in West TN, just outside of Memphis. I found my first one ever today, which lead me here to see what it was and if it would be dangerous to any of my 6 dogs. Seems like it isn\u2019t a danger unless you step on it\u2026 which will probably break me from going outside barefoot anymore!  I have it in a mason jar sitting on the grill. I will be letting it go before the night is over.  Seems as she is more beneficial to the ecosystem than she is a danger\u2026 but still, she is kinda scary looking!\njust saw one in the front yard here in Alexandria, La.  I see one every few years or so.  this is the smallest so far and it is enormous next to the \u201cfire ants\u201d we normally have.  from the posts it seems these guys are roaming all across the continent.\nJust killed one in Evanston, WY, crawling on a blanket in my garage.  It swims.\nWe just found one out here in lyman Wyoming\njust saw one in Newburgh Indiana Beautiful Creature\nI just saw one in my yard in Boonville Indiana\nlooks creepy..pretty..but..lol\nI live in Kentucky and I have them in my yard, they are beautiful to look at.  What most people don\u2019t understand about them is that they are not aggressive and will not bother you, in fact will go out of their way to avoid you if they can.  As well as they do serve a purpose, they help control the population of the wasps that are aggressive such as the Red Wasp and Yellow Jackets, etc. that are aggressive and will attack us without even being provoked.\nI live in Lafayette, LA and my grandkids just spotted one as we left my apartment. It scared all of us.  We had to look it up to see what it was.\nR U Kidding me? I\u2019ve found at least a dozen so far this summer on property in Valley Srings,Ca, they r very hard to kill by stepping on them, they need a good hard STOMP\nI just walked out on my porch in eastern Kentucky and got stung by one. My hand\u2019s swelling, but otherwise I feel okay. I typically don\u2019t have much reaction to stings at all. I wound up here when looking up to see exactly what kind of bug had stung me.\nSaw my first one yesterday.  Really cool to watch.  They are very fast.  What I found interesting was that it was not facing me, but when I moved, its abdomen moved with me\u2026.like it had eyes in the back of its body.  Swore it was an ant!  Kinda glad it\u2019s not because that would mean many, many more just like it.\nI found one yesterday in my pool in Huntingtown Md. got it out and set it free.\nmy son just got one in a pop bottle in Georgetown Illinois. glad I came home and looked it up to see what it was.\nWe have seen these in our yard several times!! Always thought it was an ant. Glad to know its a wasp as I am highly allergic to wasp\nI found one of these at our towns get this PLAYGROUND in the basketball court.I was shocked. Casar, NC.  It made a racket too.\nI live in Brazil Indiana and I have seen several in my yard and near my horses but somehow one got in my shirt and bit my stomach i have 2  big red welts the size of quarters and it hurts realy realy bad\nOuchies!\nSo many comments about killing them. Why? Just leave them be. They aren\u2019t that numerous and help control the real pests, like yellowjackets. Sure they sting, but along of things sting. No need for a killing spree.\nGood Grief, no do not let them be, kill them.  THEY HURT\nSaw one in Arabia State Park in the Atlanta GA suburbs.\nfascinating and beautiful! I just saw one of these in my yard in Brookhaven Long Island New York. I thought it was a giant fuzzy red and black ant running really fast and trying to hide.   I did get a photo of it and when I googled Giant red and black ant I found out that it\u2019s really a female wasp! I believe I read somewhere that they dig holes in the ground to lay their eggs in?I\u2019m not going to disturb her or harm her. I\u2019m going to keep an eye out and hope to see her again. I will be careful not to step on her..are they native to the eastern United States?interesting seeing other peoples comments  \nI live in Ashboro  NC and i saw one in our ditch while walking my dogs i actually thought it was cool like all the animals down here.\nI was in an area where 100 \u2013 150 of these were coming out of holes in the ground and swarming, most had wings, and they were not aggressive. I walked right through the swarm and stopped to look at them I probably stepped on 10 in the process, they were everywhere. I had seen these before but after seeing that many I had to get online to see what they are. This was in Central Wyoming.\nI just found two of these near a wash in Henderson, NV near Las Vegas.  I\u2019ve been here 13 years and this is the first time I\u2019ve seen one.\nWe live in eastern North Carolina but lived many years near the Pine Barrens of southern New Jersey.  I saw lots of strange creatures there but never anything like this huge red fuzzy bug with the black stripe. I just saw one in the pine straw near my azalea bushes.  It seemed to avoid even my shadow and went on its way so I left it alone.  I am going to keep looking for more of them.\nJust killed one today . By accident. In il. Right across the river from st.louis mo. Pretty crazy looking . Very pretty/ scary. See why a bird woulndnt eat it.

All species are members of the true ant family, Formicidae, but several groups have independently evolved the same basic behavioral and ecological syndrome. This syndrome is often referred to as \"legionary behavior\", and is an example of convergent evolution.[n 1]\nMost New World army ants belong to the subfamily Ecitoninae, which contains two tribes: Cheliomyrmecini and Ecitonini. The former only contains the genus Cheliomyrmex, whereas the latter contains four genera: Neivamyrmex, Nomamyrmex, Labidus, and Eciton.[1] The largest genus is Neivamyrmex, which contains more than 120 species; the most predominant species is Eciton burchellii; its common name \"army ant\" is considered to be the archetype of the species. Old World army ants are divided between the Aenictini and Dorylini tribes. Aenictini contains more than 50 species of army ants in the single genus, Aenictus. However, the Dorylini contain the genus Dorylus, the most aggressive group of driver ants; 60 species are known.\nOriginally, the Old World and New World lineages of army ants were thought to have evolved independently, in an example of convergent evolution. In 2003, though, genetic analysis of various species suggests that they all evolved from a single common ancestor, which lived approximately 100 million years ago at the time of the separation of the continents of Africa and South America.[1] Army ant taxonomy remains in flux, and genetic analysis will likely continue to provide more information about the relatedness of the various taxa.\n\n\nThe workers of army ants are usually blind or can have compound eyes that are reduced to a single lens. There are species of army ants where the worker caste may show polymorphism based on physical differences and job allocations; however, there are also species that show no polymorphism at all.[2] The worker caste is usually composed of sterile female worker ants.[3]\nColonies of real army ants always have only one queen, while some other ant species can have several queens. The queen is dichthadiigyne (a blind ant with large gaster) but may sometimes possess vestigial eyes.[2] The queens of army ants are unique in that they do not have wings, have an enlarged gaster size and an extended cylindrical abdomen.[4] They are significantly larger than worker army ants and possess 10\u201312 segments on their antennae.[2] Queens will mate with multiple males and because of their enlarged gaster, can produce 3 to 4 million eggs a month, resulting in synchronized brood cycles and colonies composed of millions of individuals all related to a single queen.[2][5]\nMales are large in size and have a large cylindrical abdomen, highly modified mandibles and uncommon genitalia not seen in other ants.[6] They have 13 segments on their antennae, are alated (have wings) and therefore can resemble wasps.[2] Males are born as part of a sexual brood.[6] As soon as they are born, they will fly off in search of a queen to mate with. In some instances where males seek to mate with a queen from an existing colony, the receiving workers will forcibly remove the wings in order to accommodate the large males into the colony for mating.[4] Because of their size, males are sometimes called \"sausage flies\" or \"sausage ants.\"\nThe army ant syndrome refers to behavioral and reproductive traits such as obligate collective foraging, nomadism and high specialized queens that allow these organisms to become the most ferocious social hunters.[1]\nMost ant species will send individual scouts to find food sources and later recruit others from the colony to help; however, army ants dispatch a cooperative, leaderless group of foragers to detect and overwhelm the prey at once.[1][2] Army ants do not have a permanent nest but instead form many bivouacs as they travel. The constant traveling is due to the need to hunt large amounts of prey to feed its enormous colony population.[2] Their queens are wingless and have abdomens that expand significantly during egg production.[4] This allows for the production of 3-4 million eggs every month and often results in synchronized brood cycles, thus each colony will be formed of millions of individuals that descend from a single queen. All three of these traits are found to be in all army ant species and the defining traits of army ants.[1][7]\nArmy ants have two phases of activity\u2014a nomadic (wandering) phase and a stationary (statary) phase\u2014that constantly cycle, and can be found throughout all army ants species.[4]\nThe nomadic phase begins around 10 days after the queen lays her eggs. This phase will last approximately 15 days to let the larvae develop. The ants move during the day, capturing insects, spiders, and small vertebrates to feed their brood. At dusk, they will form their nests or bivouac, which they change almost daily.[4] Among the army ants are some species that only venture out at night, but no adequate studies of their activities have been made. At the end of the nomadic phase, the larvae will spin pupal cases and no longer require food. The colony can then live in the same bivouac site for around 20 days, foraging only on approximately two-thirds of these days.[4][8]\nThe stationary phase, which lasts about two to three weeks, begins when the larvae pupate. From this point on, the prey that were previously fed to the larvae are now fed exclusively to the queen.[4] The abdomen (gaster) of the queen swells significantly, and she lays her eggs. At the end of the stationary phase, both the pupae emerge from their cocoons (eclosion) and the next generation of eggs hatch so the colony has a new group of workers and larvae. After this, the ants resume the nomadic phase.[2][4]\nArmy ants will split into groups when the size of the colony has reached a size threshold which happens approximately every three years.[9] Wingless virgin queens will hatch among a male sexual brood that will hatch at a later date. When the colony fissions, there are two ways new queens are decided. A possible outcome is a new queen will stay at the original nest with a portion of the workers and the male brood while the old queen will leave with the other portion of workers and find a new nest. Another possibility is that the workers will reject the old queen and new queens will head the two new colonies.[4][8] The workers will affiliate with individual queens based on the pheromone cues that are unique to each queen. When new bivouacs are formed, communication between the original colony and the new bivouacs will cease to exist.[4]\nBeing the largest ants on Earth, army ants, such as African Dorylus queens hold the world record in reproductive potential among the insects, with an egg-laying capacity of several millions per month. Army ant queens never have to leave the protection of the colony, where they mate with foreign incoming males which disperse on nuptial flights. The exact mating behavior of the army ant queen is still unknown, but observations seem to imply that queens may be fertilized by multiple males.[10] Due to the queen's large reproductive potential, one colony of army ants can be related to a single queen.[5]\nWhen the queen ant passes away, there is no replacement and army ants cannot rear emergency queens. Most of the time, if the queen passes away, the colony will most likely die too. Queen loss can occur due to accidents during emigrations, predator attack, old age or illness.[9] However, there are possibilities to avoid colony death. When a colony loses its queen, the worker ants will usually fuse with another colony that has a queen in a few days.,[3][11] Sometimes, the workers will backtrack along the paths of prior emigrations to search for a queen that has been lost or merge with a sister colony.[11][12] By merging with a related colony, the workers would increase their overall inclusive fitness.[9] The workers that merge into a new colony may cause the a colony to increase in size by 50%.\nWorkers in army ant species have a unique role in selecting both the queen and the male mate.\nWhen the queens emerge, the workers in the colony will form two \u2018systems\u2019 or arms in opposite directions. These queens that are hatched will move down either the arms and only two queens will succeed, one for each branch. The remaining new queens will be left in the middle and are abandoned to die. Two new bivouacs will be formed and break off into different directions. The workers will surround the two to-be queens and ensure they reach the arms and survive. These workers that surround the queens are affected by the CHC (pheromone) profile emitted from the new queen.[4]\nWhen males hatch from their brood, they will fly off to find a mate. For males to access the queen and mate, they must run through the workers in the colony. Males that are favored are superficially similar in size and shape to the queen. The males also produce large quantities of pheromones to pacify the worker ants.[4]\nIn the colony, instead of having both queen and workers producing off spring, the queen is the sole reproductive in the colony. With queens mating with multiple males, workers are on average more closely related to the offspring of the queen that to the offspring of other workers.[13] Both the queen and the daughter workers would benefit from producing sons, because worker reproduction has a colony cost or each worker is more related to the queen\u2019s son than to other worker\u2019s sons, the worker caste will oppose worker reproduction and pull their resources to only raise the queen\u2019s offspring. Three factors have been suggested to rationalize the loss of worker reproduction in the presence of a queen. First, if the worker reproduces, it lowers the general performance of the colony because it is not working. Second, workers increase their inclusive fitness by policing other workers because they themselves are more related to the queen\u2019s offspring than other worker\u2019s offspring.[13] Lastly, male larvae have a larger body size relative to workers, the larvae become too large to be transported so colonies with a sexual brood must remain in a nest for a period of 41\u201356 days as compared to non-reproductive colonies that remain in the nest an average of 17 days. This suggests that if workers produced sons, it would be produced asynchronously with the queen's sexual brood and not likely to be reared to adulthood as it would be hard for the worker to predict when the queen would reproduce.[13]\nWhen the queen of an army-ant colony dies, the workers may join another colony. In other cases, when two colonies of the same species meet, they usually change the marching direction to avoid conflicts.\nThe whole colony of army ants can consume up to 500,000 prey animals each day, so can have a significant influence on the population, diversity, and behavior of their prey.[14] The prey selection differs with the species. Underground species prey primarily on ground-dwelling arthropods and their larvae, earthworms, and occasionally also the young of vertebrates, turtle eggs, or oily seeds. A majority of the species, the \"colony robbers\", specialize in the offspring of other ants and wasps. Only a few species seem to have the very broad spectrum of prey seen in the raiding species. Even these species do not eat every kind of animal. Although small vertebrates that get caught in the raid will be killed, the jaws of the American Eciton are not suited to this type of prey, in contrast to the African Dorylus. These undesired prey are simply left behind and consumed by scavengers or by the flies that accompany the ant swarm. Only a few species hunt primarily on the surface of the earth; they seek their prey mainly in leaf litter and in low vegetation. About five species hunt in higher trees, where they can attack birds and their eggs, although they focus on hunting other social insects along with their eggs and larvae. Colonies of army ants are large compared to the colonies of other Formicidae. Colonies can have over 15 million workers and can transport 3000 prey (items) per hour during the raid period.[10][15]\nWhen army ants forage, the trails that are formed can be over 20m wide and over 100m long.[15] They stay on the path through the use of a concentration gradient of pheromones. The concentration of pheromone is highest in the middle of the trail, splitting the trail into two distinct regions: area with high concentration and two areas with low concentrations of pheromones. The outbound ants will occupy the outer two lanes and the returning ants will occupy the central lane.[15] The returning worker ants have also to be found to emit more pheromones than those leaving the nest, causing the difference in concentration of pheromone in the trails.[16] The pheromones will allow foraging to be much more efficient by allowing the army ants to avoid their own former paths and those of their conspecifics.[14]\nArmy ants do not build a nest like most other ants. Instead, they build a living nest with their bodies, known as a bivouac. Bivouacs tend to be found in tree trunks or in burrows dug by the ants. The members of the bivouac hold onto each other's legs and so build a sort of ball, which may look unstructured to a layman's eyes, but is actually a well-organized structure.[17] The older female workers are located on the exterior; in the interior are the younger female workers. At the smallest disturbance, soldiers gather on the top surface of the bivouac, ready to defend the nest with powerful pincers and (in the case of the Aenictinae and Ecitoninae) stingers. The interior of the nest is filled with numerous passages and contains many chambers with food, the queen, the larvae, and the eggs.\nMany species of army ant are widely considered to be keystone species, due to the high number of vertebrate and invertebrate associates that rely on army ant colonies for nutrition or protection.[18] During their hunt, many surface-raiding army ants are accompanied by various birds, such as antbirds, thrushes, ovenbirds and wrens, which devour the insects that are flushed out by the ants, a behavior known as cleptoparasitism.[19] A wide variety of arthropods including staphylinid beetles and mites also follow colonies. The Neotropical army ant Eciton burchellii has an estimated 350 to 500 animal associates, the most of any one species known to science.[20]\nHistorically, \"army ant\" in the broad sense, referred to various members of five different ant subfamilies: in two of these cases, the Ponerinae and Myrmicinae, only a few species and genera exhibit legionary behavior; in the other three lineages, Ecitoninae, Dorylinae, and Leptanillinae, all of the constituent species are legionary. More recently, ant classifications now recognize an additional New World subfamily, Leptanilloidinae, which also consists of obligate legionary species, so is another group now included among the army ants.\nA 2003 study of 30 species (by Sean Brady of Cornell University) indicates that army ants of subfamilies Ecitoninae (South America), Dorylinae (Africa) and Aenictinae (Asia) together formed a monophyletic group, based on data from three molecular genes and one mitochondrial gene. Brady concluded that these two groups are, therefore, a single lineage that evolved in the mid-Cretaceous period in Gondwana,[n 2] so the two subfamilies are now generally united into a single subfamily Ecitoninae, though this is still not universally recognized.[22]\nAccordingly, the army ants as presently recognized consist of these genera:"], ["World's Deadliest - Army Ants Eat Everything - YouTube", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UozWJTuhbMQ", "\n\n\nLoading...\n    \n\n\n\n\nLoading...\n    \n\n\n\n\nLoading...\n    \n\n\n\n\nLoading...\n    \n\n\n\n\nLoading...\n    \n\n\n\n\nLoading...\n    \n\n\nPublished on May 29, 2012\n\nWorld's Deadliest: Pack Hunters : SUN FEB 24 at 12P et:http://channel.nationalgeographic.com...Restless and ravenous, army ant colonies are nature's Mongol hordes.

People use other names for these ants, including Driver Ants, Legionary Ants, and even Visiting Ants.\nScientists describe army ants as ants that have two characteristics: migration or nomadic lifestyle and group predation. There are actually several different species of ants that behave this way. Some live in Africa and some live in South and Central America.\nArmy ants live in temporary nests. They seldom make underground burrows like other ants. The temporary nests, or bivouacs, are places where the ants rest between their hunting raids. The bivouac might be inside a hollow log, or it might be out in the open.\nThe ants often make the bivouac hanging from a tree limb. Thousands of workers will link their legs and their mandibles (jaws) and make an enclosed hammock for the queen. Sometimes the workers enclose the immature ants inside the hammock as well.\nThe army ants stay in the bivouac for a few weeks. Once queen comes out of the resting place and the colony starts to migrate.\nSome species of army ants migrate in line. Other species migrate in a fan-shaped wave of ants. Many thousand ants move at once. The soldier ants march at the side of the column to defend the queen.\nDuring the march, some of the workers carry the immature ants. Other workers gather all the food that they can find. As they go, the workers kill every insect, spider, snake, and lizard in their path. Birds and animals hear the ants marching and try to get out of the way.\nAs they march, the ants can climb trees or shrubs. They have been known to go through houses during the march. The residents of the houses scramble to safety when the column of ants comes in. The people remove their poultry and livestock to a place of safety.\nIf there is a benefit for the people, it is that when they return home, there are no roaches or other insect pests in their houses! The ants eat everything that does not run or fly away.\nScientists are studying these ants to find out what causes them to migrate as they do. Scientists once thought that the army ants migrated when there was no food left in the area. Now some scientists think that the timing of the migration might be linked with the development of the eggs and the immature ants in the colony. They suspect that there is a connection between the queen\u2019s egg production and the colony\u2019s movements.\n\u00a9Copyright 2011 Insects.org All rights reserved."], ["Army ant videos, photos and facts - Eciton burchellii | ARKive", "http://www.arkive.org/army-ant/eciton-burchellii/", "The army ant Eciton burchellii is best known for its spectacular \u2018swarm raids\u2019, in which several thousand ants swarm across the ground and occasionally up into the forest canopy in search of prey (3). This ant is considered a \u2018keystone species\u2019 in many Neotropical rainforests (4), meaning that it plays a critical role in the rainforest ecosystem. Over 300 recorded species, from birds to insects, are known to associate with Eciton burchellii and are thought to depend on the ant for their existence in some way (3). In South and Central America, for example, around 50 bird species depend on this army ant species to flush their insect prey out of the leaf litter during the ant\u2019s daily raids (4).\nEciton burchellii forms enormous colonies, with some colonies being made up of over half a million individuals. Each colony consists of permanently wingless queens and four worker castes. The smallest two castes, known as \u2018minims\u2019 and \u2018mediums\u2019, form small teams to collect prey items, while the larger \u2018submajor\u2019 caste are a specialised \u2018porter\u2019 caste that use their long legs to straddle prey items beneath their bodies. The largest caste of workers, known as \u2018majors\u2019, have the role of defending the colony from attack using their vicious mandibles (3) (5).\nThe swarm raids of Eciton burchellii are the largest of any Neotropical army ant, with over 200,000 individuals proceeding at a rate of up to 20 metres per hour (6). The foraging workers spread out in a fan-shaped swarm with a broad front (6) and the ants maximise their foraging efficiency by forming \u2018traffic lanes\u2019, destroying all arthropods that occur in their path. The lanes are separated by different pheromone trails, which are laid down by the outgoing and incoming ants (7).\nArmy ant workers form super-efficient teams to carry large prey items (8) and will even plug holes with their bodies to increase the flow of ants across rough terrain (9). Using such ingenious methods, the ants are able transport more than 3,000 prey items per hour, in raiding columns that can exceed 100 metres in length (7). In the course of a day\u2019s raiding, a single Eciton burchellii colony is able to capture around 30,000 prey items (4).\nEciton burchellii has a fixed 35-day activity cycle of raiding and migration that is associated with the growth of new broods of workers in the colony (10). For 20 days, the colony remains in a fixed bivouac at a single nest site, and will only raid every few days. During this time, which is known as the \u2018statary phase\u2019, the queen will produce up to 100,000 eggs (4) (6).\nThe eggs of Eciton burchellii develop in synchrony and hatch into larvae at the end of the 20-day statary period. The colony then moves into a \u2018nomadic phase\u2019 which lasts for 15 days. During this nomadic phase, when the colony has larvae to feed, the ants perform mass swarm raids every day and migrate to a new nest site each night (6). At the end of the 15 days the larvae pupate, and the colony once again enters the statary phase (4).\nEciton burchellii has a wide distribution, ranging from Mexico south to southern Brazil, Paraguay, Peru and Bolivia (3) (6).\nEciton burchellii creates temporary nests, known as \u2018bivouacs\u2019, which are usually sited in fairly exposed positions such as in brush piles, between the buttresses of trees, on tree trunks, beneath fallen logs, or inside logs and hollow trees (3) (6).\nThe bivouacs are made up of the bodies of the ants themselves, with the workers hooking the claws on their legs to one another to encompass the queen and her eggs in the centre of the mass (3) (6).\nThis species has yet to be classified on the IUCN Red List.\n\nTropical rainforests are being destroyed at an increasing rate and habitat degradation is therefore the most significant threat to Eciton burchellii (9).\nSome forms of sustainable management are thought to negatively affect this important army ant species, as the felling of long strips of forest can create clusters of habitat which may be too small or inaccessible to maintain a large colony. Such practices may result in the army ant becoming locally extinct in some parts of its range (4).\nSimilarly, studies on Eciton burchellii have suggested that habitat corridors (strips of land connecting fragmented reserves) may also be detrimental to this species\u2019 populations, unless the corridors are large enough for the army ant colonies to find and navigate successfully. If the army ant\u2019s remaining habitat becomes too small, or the corridors between habitats are not sufficiently large,colonies are highly likely to become trapped in a small pocket of rainforest and will rapidly deplete the local resources, leading to starvation (4).\nThere are currently no specific conservation measures in place for Eciton burchellii.\nResearch on Eciton burchellii has suggested that this species would benefit from a sustainable forest-harvesting strategy where reasonably large, square-like clumps of forest are removed, rather than long, thin strips (4).\nFind out more about army ants and other ant species:\nThis information is awaiting authentication by a species expert, and will be updated as soon as possible.

They attack freely, eat without discrimination, migrate to locate food sources and maintain a complex social hierarchy. They are found primarily in the southern United States, Central America, South America, Africa and parts of Asia.\nLike other ant species, the bodies of army ants consist of a head, abdomen and thorax. The thoraxes of army ants are located between the head and abdomen and are connected to the abdomen by joints known as nodes. Their abdomens are oval-shaped, and the stomach, stinger and large intestine are located within it. The head of the army ant has eyes, mouth and antennae. Their mouths consist of two jaws, or mandibles, which resemble scissors. However, adult army ants are unable to eat solid items and ingest only liquids. They use their antennae to smell, touch and communicate.\nColonies of army ants consist of a queen, workers and soldiers. A single colony can contain up to 24 million individual ants. Unlike other ant species, army ants are known to be nomadic, making temporary nests while traveling from one location to the next. Their nests are composed of the ants themselves: army ants form the walls of the nest by fastening their claws and mandibles to one another.\nWorkers are infertile females and are unable to establish their own colonies. Instead, they forage for food, bringing prey into their nests. Smaller army ant workers also tend to the queen\u2019s eggs, and soldier ants defend the army ant nest.\nCrazy Ants\nLittle Black Ants\nWhite-Footed Ants\nBlack Ants\nBlack Ants\u2019 Habitat\nLeafcutter Ants\nGrease Ants\nSugar Ants\nSugar Ants\u2019 Habitat\nArmy Ants\u2019 Habitat\nQueen Ants\nWinged Ants\n\n\t\tGive us a call:\n        \n844-514-3980\n\n\nOr schedule a call with an Orkin Specialist today and get a FREE estimate for:\n\n\t\tThis branch appears close by:\n\t\t\n\n,  \n\n\nNot in ?\n\t\tEnter a zip code below to view local branches.\n\u00a0"], ["Army Ants Habitat Facts: Where & How Army Ant Colonies ...", "http://www.orkin.com/ants/army-ants-habitat/", "Share this page:\n\u00a0"], ["When Army Ants Attack, Nothing Can Stand In The Way Of ...", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/05/army-ants-national-geographic-video_n_1571479.html", "The common name \"army ant\" refers to any one of 200 species of ants in Africa and Central and South America that are known for their aggressive foraging behavior and group predation.\nThe ants lead a nomadic lifestyle and do not construct deep burrows or permanent shelters like other ant species. Instead, colonies reside in temporary nests, spending most of their lives on the move. And when they move -- everything in their path better watch out.\nDuring their raids, the ants attack their prey in groups of more than 100,000 individuals, using their sheer numbers and powerful jaws to overrun and kill animals much larger than themselves. Usually, they feed on other bugs and small reptiles, but some African species have been known to overwhelm large vertibrates.\nNational Geographic, which produced a video on the creatures for its \"World's Deadliest\" series, described army ants as \"nature's Mongol hordes,\" alluding to the tribes of nomadic horsemen that conquered much of Asia and Europe during the 13th and 14th centuries. \nSCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO\nBut while the ants certainly leave a path of destruction in their wake, like the Mongols, for all their warlike behavior, army ants are somewhat misunderstood. \nIn 2010, the BBC reported on a study that argued that \"more than 300 species, ranging from birds to tiny mites, depend in part on a single species of army ant for their survival.\" This meant that the ants, who are famous for their destructive appetites, actually \"support a greater number of other life forms than any other known species.\"\nCertain African tribes, like the Mofu of Cameroon, use army ants in medicine and in agriculture, where they are a natural and effective method in the fight against crop pests.\nArmy ants are also of interest to biologists as an example of convergent evolution. Although the ants have their differences, different species of ants on different continents have all developed the same behavioral traits.\n\n                                        Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..\n                                      \n\n* Type the words below so we know you are not a cyborg                        "], ["Army ants - Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute", "http://www.stri.si.edu/sites/rainforest/Army_ants.html", "Here come the army ants. If you are an insect, look out! Thousands of ants may be in the column of raiders that is advancing through the rainforest, pinning down and cutting up every small creature that cannot get away. The swarm changes shape as it advances, but it may fan out as it moves until it is as wide as 100 feet at the front. In the 1930's work done at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute pioneered the study of army ant ecology and behavior.\nArmy ants don't spend all their time on raids like this.\nThey move through the forest on about a 35 day cycle. They will stay in one place for almost three weeks, sweeping out the area around the always temporary nest. Eggs are laid during this time.\nAfter these eggs hatch, producing larvae, the raids begin - to feed the hungry young.\nThese raids may last a couple of weeks. When the ants are on a raid, the column advances by day. At night, they again create their temporary nest called a bivouac. To build the nest the ants hook their claws together so their bodies form a living shield. Inside, the larvae and queen are kept safe. The army ants spend each night that way, and then in the morning they move on. Once the larvae change into nonfeeding pupae the cycle begins again.\n This is how the army ants make sure that they can successfully raise their young. But as is typical in rainforests, the lives of other species are connected with those of the ants.\n For example, there are beetles, wasps, and millipedes that imitate the smell of the army ants. Ants don't see well. They communicate with each other mostly by smell. So when these other insects imitate the army ant smell, the ants think these strangers are part of the swarm and do not attack them. That way these other insects can safely do the eating without doing the hunting of army ant prey.\n The best known camp followers are the antbirds. Sometimes as many as ten different kinds will follow a column of army as ten different kinds will follow a column of army ants, flying along the front of it. These birds do not eat the ants, but feed on insects the ants have caught and on insects that are trying to escape from the ants. Some are professional antfollowers, highly dependent on swarms and seldom found away from them.\n The chain of connection goes even further. There are butterflies that flutter around army ant columns. What they are interested in is the antbirds'droppings.\n Even rainforest people have found ways to use the army ants, some of which have huge pincher-like jaws.

So stay tuned- we\u2019re, um, making history here.\nI\u2019ll start with a brief introduction to the topic. What are army ants? Are they for real?\nYes! Army ants are real animals, and some are rather common, especially in tropical forests.\nThe key to understanding Army Ants is to recognize that they are high-energy insects. They require vast amounts of food, and they are willing to expend vast amounts of energy to obtain it. The unique traits that define army ants are thus intimately tied to a biology marked by large inputs and large expenditures.\nWhat are the unique army ant traits?\nThe army ant lifestyle is a successful one, and several evolutionarily distinct lineages of ants have taken it up. This means army ants are not a taxonomic category but a functional grouping. Still, a majority of species are related to each other, coming from a series of subfamilies collectively referred to as the \u201cDoryline section\u201d occurring in warmer regions around the world:\nDistribution of the three largest lineages of army ants, borrowed from Kronauer (2009)\nArmy ants are predominantly tropical. This, too, is likely related to  their constant need to feed. A winter dearth season is incompatible  with a lifestyle of continuous movement.\nAll told, several hundred ant species are army ants. Most are small, subterranean predators of the brood of other ants, a prey specialization that likely reflects the ancestral condition. A few species have since evolved a more catholic above-ground diet, and it is these conspicuous generalist feeders- especially some Eciton (in the Americas) and Dorylus (in Africa)- that dominate the nature documentaries.\nAs you might imagine, any animal that stays on the move to avoid  driving its food to extinction must put intense pressure on its environment. Indeed, army ants have profound  effects on prey populations. The generalist species that eat just about anything are rightly considered top predators, equal in ecosystem impact to large mammals like jaguars or wolves.\nAll this week Myrmecos blog will feature photos, videos, and commentary exploring army ants. So stick around, and don\u2019t be shy about joining the discussion!\nAs an addendum, we\u2019re apparently competing with National Grapefruit Month.\nOh no! You shouldn\u2019t have mention it, I love grapefruits. Now I don\u2019t know for whom to root for\u2026  \nhmmm\u2026 Army Ants vs Grapefruits\u2026.\nI know !!! run it thru the Taxonomy Fail Index (TFI) = T/H \nThat\u2019s sure to pick a winner !!\nI really like ants. Martha and I were in the tropics once and photographing some army ants. What you do not want to do is kneel down to photograph them and put your knee on one of their soldiers. OUCH !!! It was my fault. They are hard to get loose once locked on. BTW, I was in short pants.\nAs I understand it, the only \u2018true\u2019 nomadic ant is Dolichoderus cuspidatus and D. tubifer with Malaicoccus mealybugs.  Nomads migrate and coordinate their lives with their livestock, so army ants, which hunt prey, are more like migratory large-scale hunter-gatherers than true nomads.\nAlso, I read that dichthadiiform queens are also a unique aspect of the army ant syndrome, is that true?\nYou\u2019re right that dichthadiiform queens are part of the army ant syndrome, Jason.\nIn my thinking that\u2019s basically linked to colony reproduction, so I sort of subsumed that bit into the \u2018colony fission\u2019 example.\nI would have loved this theme even without the build-up (but it didn\u2019t hurt). \nThese are fabulous creatures, whose truth is stranger and far more beautiful than all the fiction about them.

Thanks for sharing, FM. Those are some lovely images of an Eciton hamatum bivuoac.\nOh boy, I\u2019m looking forward to this! I\u2019m not a great fan of grapefruit either, so you\u2019re safe there.\nThose jaws always seem somewhat \u201cunwieldy\u201d to me.  They look like they\u2019d be really good for stabbing and pinching, but awkward for actually manipulating food.  I\u2019d love to see some shots of army ants eating if you\u2019ve got some.  Do all army ants have crazy pincer jaws?\nYou\u2019re quite right- army ants can\u2019t do much with those jaws other than snare vertebrates.\nIt\u2019s only a small number of individuals in each colony, of some species in the genus Eciton, that bear those unwieldy defensive mandibles. Most army ants have standard triangular mandibles.\nWhat shall I say? Beautiful pictures, very interesting group of species and first hand information \u2013 something like heaven, but for real. Thankyou very much! And, sure, I\u00b4ll be reading\u00b4every word and watching every mov(i)e (without forgetting Roberta\u00b4s & Tschinkels Fire Ants (of) course)\u2026\nGreat post! I love it.

In the army ant colony, the queen ant lays eggs, the soldiers focus their attention to the defense of the colony, and the worker ants are split between being foragers or tending to the queens brood.\nThe Army ant is abundantly found in humid lowland forests or heavily forested areas of Central/South America. The changes in temperature and precipitation have no effect on the life cycles or migration of these ants.\nThe social structure and life cycles of army ants have two distinct phases. Army ant colonies go through a stationary phase and a migratory (nomadic) phase. The phases are based on the ability of a queen to produce many eggs in a very short period of time (from 100 000 to 300 000 eggs in five to ten days); thus, the queen overpopulates a given area, which then triggers migration of the colony.\nIn the stationary phase, the army ant queen's abdomen swells to hold 55 000 to 66 000 eggs. As the eggs develop into mature ants, tens of thousands of adult workers appear, triggering the nomadic phase: colony activity increases exponentially, and \"swarm raids\" increase in size and intensity. With a colony of this size, the army ant colony must emigrate daily. The migration continues until \"larval pupation\" begins. Once this occurs, the colony re-enters the stationary phase, and the cycle repeats.\nDue to their large colony sizes, army ants migrate in order to find food. Most ants are \"column feeders.\" Army ants are what are called \"swarm feeders.\" The foraging workers form a fan-shaped swarm with a broad front. Along with feeding, army ants also have a unique way of forming nests. The army ant nest is made up of army ants themselves. The ants form walls and fasten onto each other by using their mandibles. The ant colony forms these walls almost anywhere in order to enclose the queen and her brood. The nest is very structured, as it provides corridors within itself for transporting food and eggs throughout the many areas of the nest.\nArmy ant colonies march and nest in different phases as well. In the nomadic phase, army ants march at night and stop to camp during the day. The colony begins a nomadic phase when available food has decreased. During this phase, the colony makes temporary nests that are changed everyday. Each of these nomadic rampages or marches lasts for approximately 17 days.\nArmy ants are notorious for eating anything that gets in their path. They can kill and eat up to 100 000 animals in a day! They normally consume lizards, snakes, chickens, pigs, goats, scorpions, tarantulas, beetles and other ants. Army ants can also climb trees, and feed on animals within its canopy.\nArmy ants communication is completely dependent on chemical messaging and trail pheromones. These methods of communication act as a stimuli for changing behavior patterns. Unlike other ants, army ants do not have compound eyes, but instead have single eyes. Army ants are also blind and have to use their antennae to sense smell and touch. The army ants use these senses to communicate in nesting and raiding.\nAlcock, John.

They move their colonies regularly in search of prey that may include everything from insects to small mammals. There are about 150 species of army ant. They are found mostly in the warm tropical and subtropical regions of the Neotropics in South and Central America. In Africa, similar types of ants \u2013 driver ants \u2013 are also sometimes called army ants.\n\u00a9G.Ellis/GLOBIO.org\nSpecial adaptations to their on-the-move lifestyle make army ants fascinating to study. Like all ants, their mouths have two scissor-like jaws called mandibles. The mandibles are not for eating. They are for crushing, cutting, and biting. Army ants can only swallow liquids.\n\u00a9G.Ellis/GLOBIO.org\nAn army ant community is divided into three groups: a queen, drones (males), and workers (females). There are several different kinds of workers. Each type has a different kind of mandible. The giant mandibles of the guard army ants protect the smaller workers from predators. The medium-sized mandibles belong to the soldier army ants. Their main job is to capture prey, cut it up, and deliver it to the colony.\nArmy ants create a temporary nest out of their own bodies. Individual ants fasten onto each other using hooks and spines on their feet and their mandibles. In this way, the ants form a living nest, complete with walls and tunnels. These living nests are called bivouacs. Inside the bivouac, the queen and her eggs and developing larvae and pupae are safe from weather and predators. Workers bring prey inside the bivouac. They may also move the eggs to different parts of the bivouac.\n\u00a9G.Ellis/GLOBIO.org\nUnlike other ants, army ants do not have compound eyes. Only the queen and the males have single eyes. The workers are all blind and rely on chemical trails to find their way around and to get to and from their colony\u2019s nest. Their antennae help them feel their surroundings and detect the chemical trails.\nDue to their large colony size (up to 1 million ants) and carnivorous habits, army ants are nomads who must migrate in order to find enough food. Raids begin when they locate prey such as the ants in another ant nest. Then the attack begins.\n\u00a9G.Ellis/GLOBIO.org\nDifferent species of army ants have different techniques for attacking. Some species are swarm front attackers. A swarm front attack looks like a giant wave that sweeps into an area and over everything in its path. A raid front attack consists of small groups of ants coming from different directions and attacking. In each case, ants move back and forth along chemical trails they create as they move. Giant guard ants with huge mandibles line the trail and watch over the workers and protect them.\nArmy ants can kill and eat up to 100,000 animals in a day. Most of these animals are arthropods such as insects and spiders. Working as a team, army ants can also kill larger animals such as lizards, snakes, chickens, and small mammals. They also climb trees and attack birds in nests.\nThe sight of an army ant colony on the move can be pretty scary! All the small animals in the colony\u2019s path start to panic and try to escape. As they hop, fly, and run to avoid the army ants, they open themselves up to attack by other predators. Troops of monkeys and birds may spot them. For this reason, these predators often follow a migrating army ant colony and catch arthropods and small animals as they try to escape. Symbiosis of this kind is called commensalism."], ["Army Ants and Other Nomads - Alex Wild Photography", "http://www.alexanderwild.com/Ants/Making-a-Living/Army-Ants", ""], ["Army Ants - Marietta College", "http://www.marietta.edu/~biol/costa_rica/animals/army_ants.htm", "Army Ants\n\n\u00a0\nOne of the most maligned\r\n      predators in the tropics are the \"army ants\" a name that is\r\n      applied loosely to many species in several genera on several\r\n      continents.\u00a0 In some places, usually Africa, they are called\r\n      \"driver ants\".\u00a0 What they all have in common is a tendency\r\n      to forage communally - in huge groups.\u00a0 On our trips to Costa Rica,\r\n      we have seen Army Ants in several places - Santa Rosa, Monteverde and La\r\n      Selva to name 3.\n\nTo the left is a major\r\n            worker, or soldier that was accompanying the raiding column.\u00a0\r\n            These workers are larger and possess huge jaws.\u00a0 These are used\r\n            to drive off any organism foolish enough to attack the ants, and\r\n            also to help subdue larger prey items.\u00a0 Native peoples\r\n            apparently have used these soldiers to close wounds;

The guys showed up within the time predicted (2pm-4pm, they showed up at 3), were communicative, handled my belongings gently, and even helped me set furniture up a bit because I have a wonky knee. The cost was under quote, and since it took less than the minimum time (2 hours) they offered to help me with whatever I needed for the remainder. My couch was very difficult to get into my new apartment due to the hallway, but they succeeded without damaging the couch or walls. All my communications with them prior to the move were also stellar-they got back to me quickly if I left a message and called to confirm the day before. Top notch customer service! I would hire them again in a heartbeat.\n\n        Was this review \u2026?\n    \nI've moved three times with Army Ant Movers with the last being a move to Dallas. They've been incredible each and every time. My final move to Dallas required a lot of paperwork because it was being reimbursed. The paperwork got turned back initially and two months after my move, Army Ant went out of their way to help me make sure I had the documents I needed. The move itself was made incredibly easy. The movers were efficient, careful, fast and friendly. This applied to all three of the moves. I highly recommend Army Ant.\n\n        Was this review \u2026?\n    \nNo showI moved awhile back and completely forgot to post my review on these guys. \u00a0Anyway, I had booked them to move my into a downtown apartment in Austin. \u00a0I got the quote about a week before my move-in date. \u00a0Seemed like a reasonable rate. \u00a0It was $85/hour to unload a Uhaul trailer. \u00a0I scheduled the move for early in the day because Austin gets extremely hot in the summer. \u00a0They called me the day of the move and said they wouldn't be able to make it because they were double booked for another job, one that would last until the afternoon. \u00a0I explained that my parents and girlfriend were in town to help me unpack. \u00a0 I was also in a time crunch to get the rented Uhaul back before the place closed. \u00a0The guy on the phone was unapologetic but did offer to send 2 guys, possibly around 5pm. \u00a0I declined because of time constraints. \u00a0Going back, I had confirmation emails regarding the quote and appointment time. \u00a0In my opinion, if a moving company will call and cancel on you last minute, then what good are they.Update: \u00a0Thanks Steve for the feedback and I'm glad to see you guys are under new ownership. \u00a0I'm surprised my review was word for word. \u00a0I do not remember leaving one, but at any rate, I just wanted to put down my experience. \u00a0I'm sure if you guys put together a good body of work, you'll do alright. \u00a0Don't worry about a bad review or two.\n\n        Was this review \u2026?\n    \nArmy Ant Moving was a great experience ! The guys were polite, helpful, friendly and hard workers. I have moved several times and have never had this pleasant of an experience .

They also didn't drag their feet the price was great and they got everything done in the time I expected.\n\n        Was this review \u2026?\n    \nGreat place! \u00a0These guys were on time, worked quickly and safely, took good care of our stuff, and were both nice guys. \u00a0The folks I interacted with in the office were responsive and very friendly!\n\n        Was this review \u2026?\n    \nSince I wrote this review, our PODS began arriving in Omaha. We've had the two large PODS unloaded. I'm disappointed with one thing in particular. It appears that nothing was put around my washer and dryer to protect either. They are less than a year old - in fact, they aren't even paid for yet (cost: $2100; we got them 18 months no interest). They have a stainless finish. I love them. There are scratches on the side of the washer. The dryer has probably a dime to nickel size area where the finish has been scraped off (right on top). I am so upset. The guys were so good at wrapping all other pieces of furniture, I can't figure out why these pieces weren't protected. All of our furniture is all over our house right now. I haven't actually looked at each item yet but my husband hooked up the washer and dryer so I noticed that right away. I don't anticipate any other furniture issues because it looks like most things were wrapped with furniture pads or shrink wrap. Our third and final POD gets unloaded Tuesday. I hope this is the only unpleasant surprise. I realize it's only one thing but it's an expensive thing and it could easily have been avoided.\n\n        Was this review \u2026?\n    \n\n        Was this review \u2026?\n    \nAdam and Charles showed up early and prepared to work. This was the best moving experience I have ever had. They were clean respectful and worked at a lightning quick pace. I would highly recommend these guys. They came on the Fourth of July, which I did not expect at all. I greatly appreciate their very hard work and kind manner in which they handled business.\n\n        Was this review \u2026?\n    \nSo I moved a year ago. I used these guys and totally forgot to post my review. They rock. Simple and plain. Quoted me a price for the move and stood by it. Showed up on time, and did great work. I moved from the 2nd floor to another 2nd floor. They showed up, packed my stuff with care, unpacked it just the same and were on their way. Army Ant was recommended to me by a friend who had used their services. So, now I'm returning the favor. Give them a call, you will not be disappointed.\n\n        Was this review \u2026?\n    \nI found Army Ant on Yelp and with all the 5 star reviews I thought it would be a safe bet. I wasn't at the move itself since I was out of town on business, so my wife handled the move. She said the guys were on time, courteous and very professional. They took care of everything great and we were pleased with the move.As for pricing, since this is the first time we've ever used movers I cannot compare. I can say that I took quotes from other moving companies and this one was the less expensive.The reason for the 3 star is because as we are still unpacking we are discovering all this damage to furniture. We have mostly IKEA furniture that was relatively new, and almost every piece has either a scratch or chipped. The worst was one of my favorite bookcases that now has a big chip in it, which is quite disappointing. I know IKEA furniture isn't the most expensive, but it's still our furniture and having scratched and chipped furniture isn't nice.To be honest I would try someone else if I had to move again (which I hope I don't have to for a long time). I would like to see if other movers would do a better job of taking care of my furniture.\n\n        Was this review \u2026?\n    \nThese guys were AWESOME! \u00a0The showed up on time and worked quickly to unload our FIVE containers from California. \u00a0Jack led the tea, along with Adam, Clinton and a few other guys. \u00a0They were all professional and our move cost us about 35% less than hiring the other local, well-know brand. \u00a0HIGHLY recommended!\n\n        Was this review \u2026?\n    \nArmy Ant had good yelp reviews, and availability the date that I needed. I was almost worried they wouldn't be able to fit everything from my father in laws not completely full 10x30 storage unit but they made it work (and nothing was damaged). Price was reasonable, they showed up within their time frame and worked quickly. Movers were professional and friendly. I would only suggest taking a clear inventory of what you are having moved (my fault, setting up for father in law i had no idea what was in his storage unit)and they were worried they may not be able to get the riding mower onto the truck. They did though but I was scared for a minute!\n\n        Was this review \u2026?\n    \nJust had Army Ant move a FULL 4-bedroom house to another 4-bedroom with most of the heavy stuff (W/D, books, furniture, elliptical machine) going up the stairs. The guys showed up within their window and called beforehand so I wouldn't worry. They worked tirelessly all day while also being friendly and courteous. Nothing of ours was even close to getting scratched or damaged because they were so careful even while being so quick. And their estimate for hourly work was right on target with a great price point in the end. So glad I called these guys!\n\n        Was this review \u2026?\n    \nI had a big move from Fort Worth to Austin. \u00a0The movers at Army Ant came all the way to my house from Austin and packed my house into boxes. Once all of my small things had been packed the movers started padding and stretch wrapping the furnitue. They then moved all of my belonging onto the truck and we were headed to Austin. Once in Austin they unloaded everything and for each item they would ask where I wanted it in the new house. The price was comparable to other companies but their service was far superior. \u00a0 I have moved with other companies in the past and it was a nightmare. \u00a0These guys are professionals. They arrived on time and got the job done right.\n\n        Was this review \u2026?\n    \nI had many choices for my move last weekend from Pflguerville to Central Austin. \u00a0Because of what I read about Army Ant Moving, I went with them.I am so glad I did!Corey and Chris were amazing. \u00a0They are professional, hard working movers. \u00a0I had several very heavy pieces to carry from a 3rd floor to a 2nd floor apartment and they did so with extra caution.I recommend Army Ants to anyone with moving needs. \u00a0I will use them again when needed!\n\n        Was this review \u2026?\n    \nAnother stellar job. This is the 3rd move for me from these guys. They were able to bring boxes and tape. They also packed up all of my loose items and boxed them as well. They were also available on short notice. In fact, I've never had them not be able meet my scheduling needs. Thanks again guys.\n\n        Was this review \u2026?\n    \n\n        Was this review \u2026?\n    \nAbsolutely NO complaints! \u00a0From the quote from Steven to the guys that did my move... Everything was very professional!If you're moving in the north Austin area... CP/Leander... These are your guys. Low prices. No over charging for additional items. They were careful yet fast.\n\n        Was this review \u2026?\n    \nI was researching local moving companies and Army Ant came highly recommended by a co-worker.All of my previous moves I had performed alone or with assistance from unlucky friends, but this time I was not entirely enthusiastic about dragging my possessions down a few flights from the third floor. After all, I was still exhausted from having only just gotten everything up those stairs the year previous.I filled out a refreshingly detailed form on their website describing what I would have them move, and received a reasonable and solid quote via email. I promptly called to schedule and received a followup call the day before to verify I was ready.While a scheduling issue did occur, the staff was incredibly professional and substantially proactive about getting my move taken care of.Everything that could be wrapped or blanketed was, then proceeded to be properly secured neatly in their trailer. No furniture of any size stood a chance against their superiour muscle power, giant rubber bands, and hand trucks.After everything was good to go we embarked on our journey and raced to the new address within roughly an hour of their initial arrival. They didn't know we were racing, but I won, in case you were curious.Unloading was quick and painless. After all was said and done my simple furniture was assembled, my washer and dryer installed, and the pure unmitigated joy of unpacking boxes was ready to be experiencedNothing short of impressive. Highly recommended.\n\n        Was this review \u2026?\n    \nThese folks WERE as good as it gets. I used them for a move last week in Leander, TX.We started with a general quote based upon my house size, then I furnished an item list to help narrow it down. Since my husband and I wanted to save as much as possible and move the little things, they switched us to the hourly plan. From the time Matt, Matt and Lawrence arrived, they never stopped moving and ended up cutting our quote nearly in half- from a seven hour move to a four hour move. They also removed and padded our front door and were very careful with our belongings. I chose them based upon the reviews on Yelp, and as always, it didn't let me down! Thanks reviewers, and thanks Army Ant Moving!\n\n        Was this review \u2026?\n    \nArrived on time and did a confirmation call the day before move in. They worked carefully, but efficiently. Everything being moved got wrapped in a blanket. I was really happy when they said they prefer to move dressers with the drawers in. My furniture is on the cheap side (a craigslist steal!) and the drawers do not go in and out easily. Very friendly guys and good prices. My estimate and actual charge were the same. I will definitely use them again. Thanks, Steven and Javier!\n\n        Was this review \u2026?\n    \nTL;DR - These guys are the best. Would definitely use them again and recommend them highly. A co-worker had recommended a different moving company. I phoned three times and never even got a courtesy call-back to say they were too busy and/or didn't want my business. I turned to Yelp (yay, Yelp!) and saw the great reviews for AAM. Within less than 15 minutes after I submitted the online form, I got a phone call and a very reasonable quote. The day of the move, Joe and Dylan arrived precisely at the appointed time and immediately set to work. About 90 minutes later, the apartment property manager and maintenance man showed up to do their walk-through. The maintenance guy tapped the manager's shoulder and said to her, \"This is the first moving company I've ever seen here that wrapped the door.\" She told me, \"Bring me some of their cards. I get asked for referrals all the time and I'm always hesitant to give them because I feel that makes me partially responsible for the quality of the work.\" The guys were not only efficient, they were also careful with my stuff and exceptionally kind and courteous. I was kind of sad to see them leave because I had enjoyed them so much.\n\n        Was this review \u2026?\n    \nGreat job (again)!!Would recommend these guys every time. \u00a0Professional and care about your stuff!!\n\n        Was this review \u2026?\n    \n\n        Was this review \u2026?\n    \nArmy Ant Movers moved my 4 bedroom, 2.5 bath, 2 story home on January 28th. \u00a0They sent over a salesperson, Adam, who spent an hour at my home calculating a flat rate \"guaranteed\" price. \u00a0The price was not guaranteed at all, as we paid almost $300 more than the quote because of all kinds of things they \"did not know about.\" \u00a0Adam was at the house so what did they not know about? \u00a0They did show up on time, and they worked hard. \u00a0I just had the felling of being nickle and dimed at the end of the move. \u00a0If I hired this company again, I would definitely pay them hourly, and not on a \"guaranteed\" flat fee price.\n\n        Was this review \u2026?\n    \nThese guys are awesome!We moved out of a 4 bedroom home last weekend (8/3/13) and wanted to get all of it out in one truck load. Matt and Quincy were our movers and they are machines! \u00a0They worked non-stopped to get everything in the trailer while ensuring everything is packed well. \u00a0As the heat started to increase, it did not stop their pace.I will definitely use these guys again and recommend them for anyone moving in the Austin area.great job.\n\n        Was this review \u2026?\n    \nMy first move I went with craigslist, hoping to save a few bucks. That experience was like an old Russian saying - \"We're too poor to be cheap.\" Between bumping my things through elevator doorways until they fit (*note: glass doesn't bend to accommodate frames) and losing parts to furniture that can only be replaced by building a factory in China, those movers cost me significantly more than they saved. Now, I may or may not have made up the \"old Russian saying\" part, and read that inside a gas station bathroom stall somewhere, but the wisdom applies. \u00a0Next move, I decided to turn to the ants.I thought their name was a joke until watching one of their guys heave a heavy queen size mattress up two flights of stairs single handedly. At lease I think he used hands, may very well have been mandibles for that feat of superhuman strength. I tried moving it alone after he left and succeeded in lifting it an inch then dropping it onto my kitchen table, costing me two plates and a lamp. Can't blame the movers for that one. So back to the movers - the hybrid ant-movers are courteous, efficient, and get the job done fast. They finished what could have been a 3 hour job in half the time, then offered to help set up the furniture.If you need things moved at a reasonable price by knowledgeable guys, look no further.\n\n        Was this review \u2026?\n    \nI haven't written a review in a looooooooooooong time, but I have a reason! (there's always a reason, right?) \u00a0We bought our first home in the fall and have been packing/unpacking our lives away for the last few months. \u00a0We actually used 2 different moving companies for our overall move. \u00a0We used Army Ant a few years ago as part of a move-in special for the last apartment we leased. \u00a0This time for move #1, we used a different company and couldn't help but compare them to Army Ant. \u00a0For move #2 (that involved more antiques and fragile furniture) we knew we wanted to hire Army Ant again. \u00a0When we used Army Ant for our apartment, 2 guys came out and got the job done in under 1 hour. \u00a0They padded the door frame, wrapped our furniture and were incredibly professional. \u00a0This time 2 different guys came out (still just 2 total) and although we've accumulated more items over the years, they still managed to get the job done quickly while paying special attention not to damage anything (again, lots of wrapping of furniture, padding the door frame when necessary, etc). \u00a0The reason I keep stressing that each time only \"2 guys\" arrived is because 2 Army Ant movers work more quickly and professionally than the 3 or 4 guys other moving companies send out that we've worked with over the years - (and as college students/grad students, we've had quite a bit of moves from apartment to apartment). \u00a0I HIGHLY recommend Army Ant. \u00a0As I've already stated, they are fast/efficient, professional, courteous and do all the things you'd expect a moving company to do (pad and wrap your furniture, pad the door frames when necessary, secure boxes and furniture correctly inside the truck (we've had an issue with this and other companies before), etc). \u00a0If/when we move again (which I hope isn't for awhile), we'll contact Army Ant first.\n\n        Was this review \u2026?\n    \nWhen I called Army Ant I had to leave a message but Stacy called me back within minutes and was super helpful. For my needs (hourly), Army Ant turned out to be the cheapest of the bunch I tried (including Blue Whale and Mustang Movers).Daniel and Anthony showed up on time with a huge trailer that made fitting everything a breeze -- no excessive stacking and risk of damage.They were completely professional, good guys who didn't ding a single wall or piece of furniture.Without question I'll be using and recommending them exclusively from here on out!\n\n        Was this review \u2026?\n    \nWe had a terrific experience with army ant! They arrived on time, loaded us quickly, and unloaded our things quickly. They were friendly and careful. \u00a0I would highly recommend they and would use them again! Thanks army ant!\n\n        Was this review \u2026?\n    \nBest movers I have ever used. In the past, movers have dinged up furniture, taken forever, etc. You know the story. Not these guys. I hired them to move belongings out of my two bedroom apartment in Austin and to San Antonio. I originally went with them because they provided me with one of the lowest quotes, which worried me a bit. Clearly, I had no reason to worry. The three men arrived five minutes early and ready to go. Within two hours, all of my furniture, suitcases, bags, and nearly 30 boxes were packed up. They wrapped almost all of my furniture before carrying it down the three flights of stairs and loading it up - so NO dings!!!! They finished my move, including the hour+ drive, within 5-6 hours. Could not be happier with my decision! Do not pass these guys up!\n\n        Was this review \u2026?\n    \nI stumbled across Army Ant Moving through a basic google search a couple weeks before my moving day. \u00a0I filled out the online inventory sheet and got a call from Bryan that very next day. \u00a0He was very courteous and not pushy. \u00a0Throughout the week I would have to call Bryan almost daily to update our inventory and he was very understanding and patient.The actual movers for moving day were just as courteous and were pros at wrapping up the furniture and moving everything very carefully but efficient at the same time. \u00a0We also made some last minute changes and they were very accomodating to our needs on moving day!No damage was done to the apartment moving in or out. \u00a0Price was very competitive, I definitely would recommend anyone who is needing moving services to contact Army Ant Moving.\n\n        Was this review \u2026?\n    \nThey are on time, very courteous, totally professional and priced right.

Compared to some other moving companies they were reasonably priced, and most importantly they showed up on time! The movers themselves were friendly, which always makes spending 2-3 hours with complete strangers in your home better. Overall it was a smooth move and I would use them again.\n\n        Was this review \u2026?\n    \nMatt and Clinton were awesome. Worked hard, friendly, super professional, on time, fair price.

One of the things that make army ants even more interesting is how much food they require and how they get it.\nEciton burchelli soldier\nArmy ants belong to one of the subfamilies of ants called the Dorylinae, after the Greek word meaning 'spear'. There are approximately 150 species of army ant found mostly in the tropical and subtropical regions of Central and South America. There are also 100 other species in the 'Old World' (Africa, Australia and the Orient) sometimes called 'Army Ants' but more usually known as 'Driver Ants'.\nThree incredible things you should know about army ants:\nFor example one species, Eciton burchelli from South America, may have a colony containing over a million ants. Each colony consists of a single (wingless) queen, a brood of developing young and a large population of adult workers.\nOnly the Queen and the males have eyes, the workers are all blind and rely on chemical trails to find their way around.\nSome 'Driver Ant' colonies contain over 20 million individual ants!\nThey feed on other arthropods, mainly other insects which they capture by highly organised group raids. Some species have been seen to eat small vertebrates such as lizards and snakes. The amount of food caught is tremendous: workers of Eciton burchelli may capture more than 100,000 arthropods a day to feed the colony. The workers charge along the surface of the ground or along underground channels (depending on the species) and follow chemical trails laid down by the ants themselves. All the time huge soldier ants with massive jaws watch over the workers and protect them. The jaws of the soldiers are so huge that they are unable to feed themselves and must rely on workers to give them all the nourishment they need. Different army ant species use different types of raiding pattern. The two types of pattern are column raids and swarm raids. Eciton hamatum and Eciton burchelli are the two species of army ant that have been studied the most. Both species begin raiding at dawn with ants pouring out of the nest/bivouac but use different raiding systems.\nColumn raiders\nE. hamatum is a column raider. The ants produce branching trails by dividing into small foraging groups, forming a tree like pattern (See Fig 1). Each trail has a two way stream of ants running along it, some ants are advancing whilst some are returning with prey. The ants may travel over 350m from the bivouac in a raid, though it depends on the type of terrain and the condition of the colony. They often invade the nests of other social insects (but not other army ants!!) and steal their brood.\nSwarm raiders\nE. burchelli is a swarm raider. Great crowds of raiders sweep along the ground like a dragnet flushing out a huge variety of prey (See Fig 2). A fan shaped network of columns trail behind and in the rear there is a base column connecting the raiders with the bivouac. Swarmers have stronger bites and more potent stings than column raiders and they attack a wider range of prey, including hard bodied arthropods.\nDriver ants have been known to kill and dismember chickens, goats and even pigs if the animals have been injured or unable to escape the marauding ants!\nDue to their large colony size and carnivorous habits army ants must migrate in order to find enough food. The ants form only temporary nests and after raiding the whole colony emigrates to a new nest site unless it is in a 'statary' condition (the larvae in the colony are entering a pupal stage by spinning their cocoons and the enormous queen is laying eggs).\nThe 'nests' of army ants are not like those of other ants; they are made out of the ants themselves. They are therefore referred to as 'bivouacs' describing the resting state of the colony rather than a physical nest structure. The ants cluster together to form walls and fasten onto each other using their mandibles and claws on their legs.\nSo next time your picnic is interrupted by a few black ants consider yourself lucky that you don't live in the tropics where you could be carried off as well as your sandwiches!\nBack to example articles."], ["The 5 Most Horrifying Bugs in the World | Cracked.com", "http://www.cracked.com/article_15816_the-5-most-horrifying-bugs-in-world.html", "\n\n\ndigg_url = 'http://www.cracked.com/article_15816_5-most-horrifying-bugs-in-world.html';\ndigg_title = 'The 5 Most Horrifying Bugs in the World';\ndigg_bodytext = 'Are you afraid of bugs? Well, you should be.';\ndigg_media = 'news';\ndigg_topic = 'general_sciences';\n\n\n\nThere are about  \n10,000,000,000,000,000,000 insects on earth at any given moment. Seriously, that's a real number. For every one of us, there are 1.5 billion bugs. \n\n\nBut some of them are so horrifying, just one is too many. Here are five you want to avoid at all costs.\n\nJapanese Giant Hornet (vespa mandarinia japonica)\n\n\n\n\nFrom: Japan, obviously.\n\n\nWhy you must fear it:\n\nIt's the size of your thumb and it can spray flesh-melting poison.\n   We really wish we were making that up for, you know, dramatic effect because goddamn, what a terrible thing a three-inch acid-shooting hornet would be, you know? Oh, hey, did we mention it shoots it into your eyes? Or that the poison also has a pheromone cocktail in it that'll call every hornet in the hive to come over and sting you until you are no longer alive?\n\n\nThink you can outrun it? It can fly 50 miles in a day. It'd be nice to say something reassuring at this point, like \"Don't worry, they only live on top of really tall mountains where nobody wants to live,\" but no, they live all over the goddamned place, including outside Tokyo.\n\n\nForty people die like that every year, each of them horribly.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore scary shit:\n\nHere's how the Japanese hornet treats other insects (and would presumably treat us, if we were small enough). An adult hornet will fly miles to find some squishy shit to feed to its children. Often times, it finds its food in, say, a hive inhabited by thousands of bees.\n\n\nWhat to do? Well, Vespa japonica sprays the nest with some of the acid/pheromone and brings in reinforcements, usually consisting of  30 or so fellow hornets. They then descend upon the beehive like an unholy plague of hell-born death engines and proceed to make this world a scary goddamned place. This is maybe 30 wasps against 30,000 bees and the 30,000 bees do not stand a chance.  \n\n\n\n\n\nBehold the hornets systematically seize them with huge, wicked jaws and literally fucking cut them apart, one by one by one by fucking one.  In three hours, there are piles of limbs and heads and just fucking bits of things that could possibly have been alive at one point, and the hornets have stormed the hive and flown away with all the bee's children. Who will then be eaten.\n\n\n\n\n\nNature is fucking hardcore.\n\nBullet Ant (Paraponera clavata)\n\n\n\n\nFrom:\n\nRainforests from Nicaragua to Paraguay\n\n\nWhy you must fear it:\n\nIt's a full inch long, it lives in trees and thus can and will fall on you to scare you away from its hive--the one you didn't know was there, because it's in a fucking tree. Before it does this, it shrieks at you.  This ant, you see, can shriek.  \n\n\nIt's called a Bullet Ant because its 'unusually severe' sting feels like getting shot.\n On the Schmidt Sting Index, Bullet Ants rate as the number one most try-not-to-shit-out-your-spine painful in the entirety of the Kingdom Arthropoda.\n   Also--and we do feel the need to stress this--they fucking shriek at you before they attack.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore scary shit:\n\n Are you the sort of person who likes to think of yourself as tough? A \"badass,\" perhaps? \"Hard,\" as they say?\n\n\n Some of the indigenous peoples of the area use Bullet Ants as part of this initiation-to-manhood ceremony that they do. You know the kind we mean, with us it's like, a big party and your relatives give you money and everyone loves you and is so proud of you? Yeah with them, it's these special leaf sleeves with hundreds of bullet ants woven into them, stingers-inwards. They put them on and are immediately stung to holy fucking bejeezus by, and this is important, hundreds of Bullet Ants woven into the sleeves, stingers-inward.\n\n\n\n\n\n   The goal is to leave them on for 10 minutes, after which their arms are stiff, useless lengths of twisting agony, their bodies wracked with uncontrollable spasms for days. And in order to be actually pass the ordeal and become a man, they have to do it 20 fucking times.\n\nAfricanized Honey Bee (Apis mellifera scutellata)\n\n\n\n\nFrom:\n\nSouth and Central America, the American Southwest\n\n\nWhy you must fear it:\n\nYou know how you can spot one of these? You can't. There is no physical way to determine the difference between an Africanized bee and a common European bee. None whatsoever.\n\n\nYou can, however, easily tell the difference based on their behavior. Regular bees will give you about nine seconds of being too close to the hive before deciding you're a threat and then attacking you. So it's pretty easy to just walk past them without any screams. And if you do get them after you, they'll consider you to be 'chased off' after about 300 feet.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfricanized bees do not roll this way. They give you half a second of being too close before they decide it is time to completely fuck your shit up and empty the entire hive--tens, maybe hundreds of thousands of angry, angry bees. When you run, flailing and crying and soiling yourself while screaming \"JESUS CHRIST I'M COVERED IN BEES,\" they will chase you for over half a mile.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore scary shit:\n\nAfricanized bees owe their existence to science. Warwick E. Kerr created them in Brazil during the 1950s by crossing a European bee with an African bee. He wanted a bee that could live in the jungle. He got a bee that swarms by the hundreds of millions, is insanely territorial, mindlessly aggressive, has killed anywhere from a few dozen to a few thousand people. And, can live in the jungle.\n\n\n And after they escaped and swarmed northward, it turned out they were a-OK with deserts, too. They'll be in Montana by 2010. \n\nArmy or Soldier Ant (Eciton burchellii)\n\n\n\n\nFrom:\n\nThe Amazon Basin. There's other subfamilies living in Asia and Africa, but these are the most notorious.\n\n\nWhy you must fear it:\n\n By now, you will not be surprised to hear that these ants are, in fact, fucking huge, with the soldiers reaching a half inch in length. You will also not be surprised to learn that they have massive, powerful, machete-like jaws half the length of the soldiers themselves. They're notorious for dismantling any living thing in their path, regardless of size. They're also completely blind, which for some reason makes the whole thing worse.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey're called 'Army' ants because their entire colony, comprising up to and over one million insects, is a 100 percent mobile battalion. They don't make permanent hives like other ants, no, they bivouac down in single locations just long enough for the queen to shit out thousands of eggs, while the soldiers spread out in wide fans daily in search of food (\"food\"  here, means \"anything moving\"). Then the eggs hatch and they enter the dreaded swarm phase of their existence.\n\n\n\n\n\n   Much like the word \"killer,\" nature takes words like \"dreaded\" and \"swarm\" very, very seriously.\n   They carefully pick up their larvae and go on the move, a near-solid mass of insect death and horror moving steadily and swiftly along the jungle floor, flaying alive and disassembling every living thing too stupid, slow or asleep to get the living fuck out of the way. There is no talk of painful stingers or ballistic acid here, no, this is terror of a far more primordial nature--the kind that simply flows over you by the hundreds of thousands and rips you apart with massive, unbelievably powerful jaws, utterly and literally blind to size and species, considering everything in their path to be a threat to the continuation of their colony.\nThere are reports of animals the size of horses being overwhelmed and shredded by them. Go stand next to a horse and then think about what that means for you. \n\n\nMore scary shit:\n\nArmy Ants are masters of wholly-organic, living architecture.  \n   For the good of the colony, the ants will use their own living bodies to build any conceivable structure necessary, latching on to each other foot-to-foot to create protective walls and ceilings against the ravages of the weather, bridges to cross otherwise impassable spans, whatever happens to be needed. (Can they form themselves into a crude catapult mechanism and launch themselves at prey? Not yet.) \n\n\nThere is no other living thing in the entire world that does this. \n\n\nAnd, they're blind.\n\n\nNow, time for the disclaimer. If you are squeamish or have a weak stomach or value your sanity in any way, you may want to bail out now.\n\n\nOkay, here goes...\n\nBot Fly (family oestridae, genus and species varies)\n\n\n\n\nFrom:\n\nMost species found in Central and South America, some species found all over the world\n\n\nWhy you must fear it:\n\nOh boy. Ohhhhh boy. Okay, Bot flies. \n\n There are dozens of varieties of Bot Fly, they're each highly adapted to target a specific animal, they have delightfully descriptive names like Horse Stomach Bot Fly, Sheep Nose Bot Fly and, hey, guess what. One of them is called Human Bot Fly.\n\n\nThere are about  \n10,000,000,000,000,000,000 insects on earth at any given moment. Seriously, that's a real number. For every one of us, there are 1.5 billion bugs. \n\n\nBut some of them are so horrifying, just one is too many. Here are five you want to avoid at all costs.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom: Japan, obviously.\n\n\nWhy you must fear it:\n\nIt's the size of your thumb and it can spray flesh-melting poison.\n   We really wish we were making that up for, you know, dramatic effect because goddamn, what a terrible thing a three-inch acid-shooting hornet would be, you know?

Then the eggs hatch and they enter the dreaded swarm phase of their existence.\n\n\n\n\n\n   Much like the word \"killer,\" nature takes words like \"dreaded\" and \"swarm\" very, very seriously.\n   They carefully pick up their larvae and go on the move, a near-solid mass of insect death and horror moving steadily and swiftly along the jungle floor, flaying alive and disassembling every living thing too stupid, slow or asleep to get the living fuck out of the way. There is no talk of painful stingers or ballistic acid here, no, this is terror of a far more primordial nature--the kind that simply flows over you by the hundreds of thousands and rips you apart with massive, unbelievably powerful jaws, utterly and literally blind to size and species, considering everything in their path to be a threat to the continuation of their colony.\nThere are reports of animals the size of horses being overwhelmed and shredded by them.

(Can they form themselves into a crude catapult mechanism and launch themselves at prey? Not yet.) \n\n\nThere is no other living thing in the entire world that does this. \n\n\nAnd, they're blind.\n\n\nNow, time for the disclaimer.

It is the only extant genus in the tribe Bombini, though a few extinct related genera (e.g., Calyptapis) are known from fossils. Over 250 species are known,[1] found primarily in higher latitudes or at higher altitude in the Northern Hemisphere, although they also occur in South America; however, a few lowland tropical species are known. European bumblebees have been introduced to New Zealand and Tasmania.\nBumblebees are social insects which form colonies with a single queen; colonies are smaller than those of honey bees, consisting often of fewer than 50 individuals in a nest. Female bumblebees can sting, repeatedly, but generally ignore humans and other animals.\nBumblebees have round bodies covered in soft hair (long, branched setae), called pile, making them appear and feel fuzzy. They have warning coloration, often in bands, in combinations of black, yellow, orange/red, and white.[2] They are best distinguished from similarly large, fuzzy bees by the form of the female hind leg, which is modified to form a pollen basket: a bare shiny concave surface, surrounded by a fringe of hairs used to transport pollen (in similar bees, the hind leg is completely hairy, and pollen grains are wedged into the hairs for transport).\nLike their relatives the honey bees, bumblebees feed on nectar, using their long hairy tongues to lap up the liquid; the proboscis is folded under the head for flight. Bumblebees gather pollen to feed their young. They forage using colour and spatial relationships to identify flowers to feed from. Some bumblebees exhibit \"nectar robbing\", making a hole near the base of a flower to access the nectar while avoiding pollen transfer. Bumblebees are important agricultural pollinators, so their decline in Europe, North America, and Asia is a cause for concern.\n\n\nIn fertilised queens, the ovaries are activated when the queen lays her egg. It passes along the oviduct to the vagina. In the vagina is a chamber called the spermatheca, where the queen stores sperm from her mating. The queen, depending on need, may allow her egg to be fertilised. Unfertilised eggs become males, and only fertilised eggs grow into females and queens. The hormones that stimulate the development of the ovaries are suppressed in female worker bees, while the queen remains dominant. Before hibernation, queens eat as much as they can to increase their store of body fat; it is used up during hibernation.\nLike all bee tongues, the bumblebee tongue (the proboscis) is a long, hairy structure that extends from a sheath-like modified maxilla. The primary action of the tongue is lapping, i.e. repeated dipping of the tongue into liquid.[3] During lapping, nectar is drawn up the proboscis by capillary action. When at rest or flying, the proboscis is kept folded under the head. The exoskeleton of the abdomen is divided into plates called dorsal tergites and ventral sternites. Wax is secreted from glands on the sternites.\nThe brightly coloured pile of the bumblebee is a form of aposematic signal. Depending on the species and morph, these colours can range from entirely black, to bright yellow, red, orange, white, and pink. Thick pile can also act as insulation to keep the bee warm in cold weather.[citation needed] Further, when flying, a bee builds up an electrostatic charge, and as flowers are usually well grounded, pollen is attracted to the bee's pile when it lands. When a pollen-covered bee enters a flower, the charged pollen is preferentially attracted to the stigma because it is better grounded than the other parts of the flower.\nBumblebees do not have ears, but they can feel the vibrations of sounds through nearby materials.\nBumblebees are typically found in higher latitudes and/or high altitudes, though exceptions exist (a few lowland tropical species exist).[4] A few species (Bombus polaris and B. alpinus) range into very cold climates where other bees might not be found; B. polaris can be found in northern Ellesmere Island\u2014the northernmost occurrence of any eusocial insect\u2014along with its parasite, B. hyperboreus.[5] One reason for this is that bumblebees can regulate their body temperature, via solar radiation, internal mechanisms of \"shivering\" and radiative cooling from the abdomen (called heterothermy). Other bees have similar physiology, but the mechanisms have been best studied in bumblebees.[6] They adapt to higher elevations by extending their wing stroke amplitude.[7]\nBumblebees form colonies, which are usually much less extensive than those of honey bees. This is due to a number of factors including the small physical size of the nest cavity, the responsibility of a single female for the initial construction and reproduction that happens within the nest, and the restriction of the colony to a single season (in most species). Mature bumblebee nests often hold fewer than 50 individuals. Bumblebee nests may be found within tunnels in the ground made by other animals, or in tussock grass as opposed to carpenter bees that burrow into wood. Bumblebees sometimes construct a wax canopy (\"involucrum\") over the top of their nests for protection and insulation. Bumblebees rarely preserve their nests through the winter, though some tropical species live in their nests for several years (and their colonies can grow quite large, depending on the size of the nest cavity). In temperate species, the last generation of summer includes a number of queens that overwinter separately in protected spots. The queens can live up to one year, possibly longer in tropical species.\nBumblebee nests are first constructed by overwintered queens in the spring (in temperate areas). Upon emerging from hibernation, the queen collects pollen and nectar from flowers and searches for a suitable nest site. The characteristics of the nest site vary among bumblebee species, with some species preferring to nest in underground holes and others in tussock grass or directly on the ground. Once the queen finds a site, she prepares wax pots to store food, and wax cells in which to lay eggs. These eggs then hatch into larvae, which cause the wax cells to expand isometrically into a clump of brood cells.\nTo develop, these larvae must be fed both nectar for carbohydrates and pollen for protein. Bumblebees feed nectar to the larvae by chewing a small hole in the brood cell into which they regurgitate nectar. Larvae are fed pollen in one of two ways, depending on the bumblebee species. So-called \"pocket-maker\" bumblebees create pockets of pollen at the base of the brood-cell clump from which the larvae feed themselves. Conversely, \"pollen-storers\" keep pollen in separate wax pots and feed it to the larvae in the same fashion as nectar.[8] Bumblebees are not capable of direct transfer of food from one bee to another.\nWith proper care, the larvae progress through four instars, becoming successively larger with each moult. At the end of the fourth instar, the larvae spin silk cocoons under the wax covering the brood cells, changing them into pupal cells. The larvae then undergo an intense period of cellular growth and differentiation and become pupae. These pupae then develop into adult bees, and chew their way out of the silk cocoon. When adult bumblebees first emerge from their cocoons, the hairs on their body are not yet fully pigmented and are a greyish-white colour. The bees are referred to as \"callow\" during this time, and they do not leave the colony for at least 24 hours. The entire process from egg to adult bee can take as long as five weeks, depending on the species and the environmental conditions.\nAfter the emergence of the first or second group of workers, workers take over the task of foraging and the queen spends most of her time laying eggs and caring for larvae. The colony grows progressively larger and eventually begins to produce males and new queens. The point at which this occurs varies among species and is heavily dependent on resource availability and environmental factors. Unlike the workers of more advanced social insects, bumblebee workers are not physically reproductively sterile and can lay haploid eggs that develop into viable male bumblebees. Only fertilised queens can lay diploid eggs that mature into workers and new queens.\nEarly in the colony cycle, the queen bumblebee compensates for potential reproductive competition from workers by suppressing their egg-laying by way of physical aggression and pheromonal signals.[9] Thus, the queen is usually the mother of all of the first males laid. Workers eventually begin to lay male eggs later in the season when the queen's ability to suppress their reproduction diminishes.[10] The reproductive competition between workers and the queen is one reason why bumblebees are considered \"primitively eusocial\".\nNew queens and males leave the colony after maturation. Males in particular are forcibly driven out by the workers. Away from the colony, the new queens and males live off nectar and pollen and spend the night on flowers or in holes. The queens are eventually mated (often more than once) and search for a suitable location for diapause (dormancy).\nBumblebees generally visit flowers that exhibit the bee pollination syndrome. They can visit patches of flowers up to 1\u20132 km from their colony.[11] They tend to visit the same patches of flowers every day, as long as they continue to find nectar and pollen,[12] a habit known as pollinator or flower constancy. While foraging, bumblebees can reach ground speeds of up to 15 metres per second (54\u00a0km/h).[13]\nBumblebees use a combination of colour and spatial relationships to learn from which flowers to forage.[14] They can also detect both the presence and the pattern of electric fields on flowers, which occur due to the positive static charges generated when bees fly through the air (see Atmospheric electricity), and take a while to leak away into the ground. They use this information to find out if a flower has been recently visited by another bee.[15] After arriving at a flower, they extract nectar using their long tongues (\"glossae\") and store it in their crops. Many species of bumblebees also exhibit \"nectar robbing\": instead of inserting the mouthparts into the flower normally, these bees bite directly through the base of the corolla to extract nectar, avoiding pollen transfer.[16] These bees obtain pollen from other species of flowers which they \"legitimately\" visit.\nPollen is removed from flowers deliberately or incidentally by bumblebees. Incidental removal occurs when bumblebees come in contact with the anthers of a flower while collecting nectar. The bumblebee's body hairs receive a dusting of pollen from the anthers, which is then groomed into the corbicula (\"pollen basket\"). Bumblebees are also capable of buzz pollination.\nIn at least a few species, once a bumblebee has visited a flower, it leaves a scent mark on it. This scent mark deters visitation of the flower by other bumblebees until the scent degrades.[17] This scent mark is a general chemical bouquet that bumblebees leave behind in different locations (e.g. nest, neutral, and food sites),[18] and they learn to use this bouquet to identify both rewarding and unrewarding flowers.[19] In addition, bumblebees rely on this chemical bouquet more when the flower has a high handling time (i.e. it takes a longer time for the bee to find the nectar).[20]\nOnce they have collected nectar and pollen, bumblebees return to the nest and deposit the harvest into brood cells, or into wax cells for storage. Unlike honey bees, bumblebees only store a few days' worth of food, so are much more vulnerable to food shortages.[21]\nBumblebees of the subgenus Psithyrus (known as 'cuckoo bumblebees', and formerly considered a separate genus) are a lineage that live parasitically in the colonies of other bumblebees and have lost the ability to collect pollen. Before finding and invading a host colony, a Psithyrus female (there is no caste system in these species) feeds directly from flowers. Once she has infiltrated a host colony, the Psithyrus female kills or subdues the queen of that colony and forcibly (using pheromones and/or physical attacks) \"enslaves\" the workers of that colony to feed her and her young.[22] The female Psithyrus also has a number of morphological adaptations, such as larger mandibles and a larger venom sac that increase her chances of taking over a nest.[23] Upon hatching, the Psithyrus male and female disperse and mate. Like nonparasitic bumblebee queens, Psithyrus females find suitable locations to spend the winter and enter diapause upon being mated.\nIn temperate zone species, in the autumn, young queens (\"gynes\") mate with males (drones) and diapause during the winter in a sheltered area, whether in the ground or in a man-made structure.\nIn the early spring, the queen comes out of diapause and finds a suitable place to create her colony. Then she builds wax cells in which to lay her fertilised eggs from the previous winter. The eggs that hatch develop into female workers, and in time, the queen populates the colony, with workers feeding the young and performing other duties similar to honey bee workers. New reproductives are produced in autumn, and the queen and workers die, as do the males.\nQueen and worker bumblebees can sting. Unlike a honey bee's stinger, a bumblebee's stinger lacks barbs, so it can sting repeatedly without injuring itself.[24][25] Bumblebee species are not normally aggressive, but will sting in defence of their nest, or if harmed. Female cuckoo bumblebees will aggressively attack host colony members, and sting the host queen, but will ignore other animals (e.g. humans) unless disturbed.\nBumblebees are important pollinators of both crops and wildflowers.\nIn his first edition (1859) of On the Origin of Species,[26] Charles Darwin wrote of \"humble-bees\" (a now-disused term for bumblebees; see the etymology section below in this article for more information) and their interactions with other species:\nplants and animals, most remote in the scale of nature, are bound together by a web of complex relations. [...] I have [...] reason to believe that humble-bees are indispensable to the fertilisation of the heartsease (Viola tricolor), for other bees do not visit this flower. From experiments which I have tried, I have found that the visits of bees, if not indispensable, are at least highly beneficial to the fertilisation of our clovers; but humble-bees alone visit the common red clover (Trifolium pratense), as other bees cannot reach the nectar. Hence I have very little doubt, that if the whole genus of humble-bees became extinct or very rare in England, the heartsease and red clover would become very rare, or wholly disappear. The number of humble-bees in any district depends in a great degree on the number of field-mice, which destroy their combs and nests; and Mr. H. Newman, who has long attended to the habits of humble-bees, believes that 'more than two thirds of them are thus destroyed all over England.' Now the number of mice is largely dependent, as every one knows, on the number of cats; and Mr. Newman says, 'Near villages and small towns I have found the nests of humble-bees more numerous than elsewhere, which I attribute to the number of cats that destroy the mice.' Hence it is quite credible that the presence of a feline animal in large numbers in a district might determine, through the intervention first of mice and then of bees, the frequency of certain flowers in that district!\nBumblebees are increasingly cultured for agricultural use as pollinators because they can pollinate plant species that other pollinators cannot by using a technique known as buzz pollination. For example, bumblebee colonies are often placed in greenhouse tomato production, because the frequency of buzzing that a bumblebee exhibits effectively releases tomato pollen.[27]\nThe agricultural use of bumblebees is limited to pollination. Because bumblebees do not overwinter the entire colony, they are not obliged to stockpile honey, so are not useful as honey producers.\nSome concerns exist about the impact of the international trade in mass-produced bumblebee colonies. Evidence from Japan[28] and South America[29] indicates bumblebees can escape and naturalise in new environments, causing damage to native pollinators. In addition, mounting evidence indicates mass-produced bumblebees may also carry diseases, harmful to wild bumblebees[30][31] and honeybees.[31]\nBumblebee species are declining in Europe, North America, and Asia due to a number of factors, including land-use change that reduces their food plants. In North America, pathogens are possibly having a stronger negative effect especially for Bombus str. in North America. [32] Bumblebees are in danger in many developed countries due to habitat destruction and collateral pesticide damage. The European Food Safety Authority announced their research findings that three pesticides (clothianidine, imidaclopride, and thiam\u00e9thoxame) presented a high risk for bees.[33] In Britain, until relatively recently, 19 species of native true bumblebees were recognised along with six species of cuckoo bumblebees.[34][citation needed] Of these, three have been extirpated,[35][36] eight are in serious decline, and only six remain widespread.[37] Similar declines in bumblebees have been reported in Ireland, with four species being designated endangered, and another two species considered vulnerable to extinction.[38] A decline in bumblebee numbers could cause large-scale changes to the countryside, resulting from inadequate pollination of certain plants. The world's first bumblebee sanctuary was established at Vane Farm in the Loch Leven National Nature Reserve in Scotland in 2008.[39]\nSome bumblebees native to North America are also vanishing, such as Bombus terricola, Bombus affinis, and Bombus occidentalis, and one, Bombus franklini, may even be extinct.[40]\nIn 2011, London's Natural History Museum led the establishment of an International Union for the Conservation of Nature Bumblebee Specialist Group, chaired by Dr. Paul H. Williams,[41] to assess the threat status of bumblebee species worldwide using Red List criteria.[42]\nAccording to 20th-century folklore, the laws of aerodynamics prove the bumblebee should be incapable of flight, as it does not have the capacity (in terms of wing size or beats per second) to achieve flight with the degree of wing loading necessary. The origin of this claim has been difficult to pin down with any certainty. John McMasters recounted an anecdote about an unnamed Swiss aerodynamicist at a dinner party who performed some rough calculations and concluded, presumably in jest, that according to the equations, bumblebees cannot fly.[44] In later years, McMasters has backed away from this origin, suggesting there could be multiple sources, and the earliest he has found was a reference in the 1934 book Le Vol des Insectes by French entomologist Antoine Magnan (1881\u20131938); they had applied the equations of air resistance to insects and found their flight was impossible, but \"One shouldn't be surprised that the results of the calculations don't square with reality\".[45]\nThe following passage appears in the introduction to Le Vol des Insectes:\nTout d'abord pouss\u00e9 par ce qui se fait en aviation, j'ai appliqu\u00e9 aux insectes les lois de la r\u00e9sistance de l'air, et je suis arriv\u00e9 avec M. Sainte-Lagu\u00eb \u00e0 cette conclusion que leur vol est impossible.\nThis translates to:\nFirst prompted by what is done in aviation, I applied the laws of air resistance to insects, and I arrived, with Mr. Sainte-Lagu\u00eb, at this conclusion that their flight is impossible.\nMagnan refers to his assistant Andr\u00e9 Sainte-Lagu\u00eb.[46]\nSome credit physicist Ludwig Prandtl (1875\u20131953) of the University of G\u00f6ttingen in Germany with popularizing the idea. Others say Swiss gas dynamicist Jacob Ackeret (1898\u20131981) did the calculations.[47]\nThe calculations that purported to show that bumblebees cannot fly are based upon a simplified linear treatment of oscillating aerofoils. The method assumes small amplitude oscillations without flow separation. This ignores the effect of dynamic stall (an airflow separation inducing a large vortex above the wing) which briefly produces several times the lift of the aerofoil in regular flight. More sophisticated aerodynamic analysis shows the bumblebee can fly because its wings encounter dynamic stall in every oscillation cycle.[48]\nAdditionally, John Maynard Smith, a noted biologist with a strong background in aeronautics, has pointed out that bumblebees would not be expected to sustain flight, as they would need to generate too much power given their tiny wing area. However, in aerodynamics experiments with other insects, he found that viscosity at the scale of small insects meant even their small wings can move a very large volume of air relative to the size, and this reduces the power required to sustain flight by an order of magnitude.[49]\nAnother description of a bee's wing function is that the wings work similarly to helicopter blades, \"reverse-pitch semirotary helicopter blades\".\nBees beat their wings about 200 times a second. Their thorax muscles do not expand and contract on each nerve firing, but rather vibrate like a plucked rubber band. This is efficient, since it lets the system consisting of muscle and wing operate at its resonant frequency, leading to low energy consumption. Further, it is necessary, since nerves cannot fire 200 times per second. These types of muscles are called asynchronous muscles[50] and are often found in insect wings.\nOne common, yet incorrect, assumption is that the buzzing sound (\u00a0listen\u00a0(help\u00b7info)) of bees is caused by the beating of their wings. The sound is actually the result of the bee vibrating its flight muscles, and this can be achieved while the muscles are decoupled from the wings. This is especially pronounced in bumblebees, as they must warm up their bodies considerably to get airborne at low ambient temperatures.[6] Bumblebees have been known to reach an internal thoracic temperature of 30\u00b0C (86\u00b0F) using this method.\nFor a complete list, see List of world bumblebee species.\nThe word \"bumblebee\" is a compound of \"bumble\" + \"bee\"\u00a0\u2014 \"bumble\" meaning to hum, buzz, drone, or move ineptly or flounderingly.[51] According to the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the term \"bumblebee\" was first recorded as having been used in the English language in the 1530 work Lesclarcissement by John Palsgrave, \"I bomme, as a bombyll bee dothe.\"[52] However the OED also states that the term \"humblebee\" predates it, having first been used in 1450 in Fysshynge wyth Angle, \"In Juyll the greshop & the humbylbee in the medow.\"[53] The latter term was used in A Midsummer Night's Dream (circa 1600) by William Shakespeare, \"The honie-bags steale from the humble Bees.\"[54] In the period prior to World War I the preferred English common name was \"humble bee\", as found in On the Origin of Species (1859) by Charles Darwin (see above in this article for a lengthy quotation), though \"bumblebee\" was still in use as well, for example in The Tale of Mrs. Tittlemouse (1910) by Beatrix Potter, \"Suddenly round a corner, she met Babbitty Bumble--\"Zizz, Bizz, Bizzz!\" said the bumblebee.\" In the post-World War II era, however, \"humblebee\" fell into near-total disuse.[55]\nThe orchestral interlude Flight of the Bumblebee was composed (circa 1900) by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov to represent the turning of Prince Guidon into a bumblebee so he can fly away to visit his father, Tsar Saltan, in the opera The Tale of Tsar Saltan,[56] although the music is considered to more accurately reflect the flight of a bluebottle than a bumblebee.[57] The music inspired Walt Disney to feature a bumblebee in his 1940 animated musical Fantasia and have it sound as if it were flying in all parts of the theater. This early attempt at \"surround sound\" was unsuccessful, and the music was excluded from the film's release.[58]\nThe archaic English colloquialism dumbledor (also used for cockchafers)[59] is the source of the name Albus Dumbledore, a fictional character from the Harry Potter series (1997\u20132007). J. K. Rowling said the name \"seemed to suit the headmaster, because one of his passions is music and I imagined him walking around humming to himself\".[60]\nThe genus name Bombus, assigned by Pierre Andr\u00e9 Latreille in 1802, is derived from the Latin word for a buzzing or humming sound.[61]\nThe Bumblebee Conservation Trust is a registered charity, founded to prevent the extinction \"of any of the UK's bumblebees.\"[62]"], ["Bumblebee (Transformers) - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bumblebee_(Transformers)", "Bumblebee is the name of several fictional characters from the Transformers franchise. In most incarnations, Bumblebee is a small, yellow Autobot with the altmode of a compact car.[1] The characters and related events are described, below, using in-universe tone.\n\n\nBumblebee (known as Bumble in Japan, Moscardo in Portugal, \u0170rdong\u00f3 in Hungary, Maggiolino in Italy) is the \"little brother\" of the heroic or protagonistic Autobot faction and a mascot, constantly striving to prove himself in the eyes of the other robots - especially his leader, Optimus Prime. This often causes him to take risks that put him in danger. Although a bit of a smart aleck, he is a capable and reliable messenger and spy, his small size allowing him to go places that his larger commanders cannot. He is highly fuel-efficient, has great visual acuity, is particularly adaptable to undersea environments and transforms into a Saturn yellow Volkswagen Beetle. He was later reconstructed into a stronger, more mature form as Goldbug.\nAt BotCon 2010, Hasbro named Bumblebee as one of the first five robot inductees in the Transformers Hall of Fame.[2] He is also IGN's second favorite Autobot.\nBumblebee holds the distinction of being the second character to appear on-screen in the original Transformers animated series, while on a mission to recover a small clutch of energy conductors with Wheeljack, illustrating the energy crisis holding sway over their home planet of Cybertron. Bumblebee is subsequently among the Transformers aboard the Ark as it set off searching for new worlds and new energy sources, which crashed on Earth, causing the Transformers within to be trapped in stasis for four million years. Awakening in 1984, Bumblebee helps Ironhide quell a raging river and uses his small size to help Sparkplug Witwicky plant explosives in the midst of a Decepticon mining operation.\nHe later befriends Sparkplug's son Spike, but on their first adventure together they are both kidnapped by the Decepticons, and Bumblebee is brainwashed into luring the other Autobots into a trap.\nWhen the body of the deceased Optimus Prime is recovered from space by a pair of Transformer-hating human scientists who intend to use it to lure the Autobots into a trap, Bumblebee is part of the rescue team led by Rodimus Prime to recover it. Entering the lab, some of the Transformers are exposed to rage-inducing alien spores that cause them to run wild, and although Bumblebee avoids infection, he is seriously damaged by the rampaging Superion. A member of the alien race called the Quintessons subsequently repair and restore Optimus Prime to life, so he can stop the \"Hate Plague\" and repair Bumblebee. The little Autobot has been so severely damaged, however, that he requires an entire reconstruction. In his new, shiny body, he comments that he has gone beyond just being Bumblebee, and is now a \"gold bug\", prompting Optimus Prime to redub him Goldbug. Goldbug travels with Optimus Prime to the planet of Chaar in order to secure a heat resistant alloy that can protect him from the plague, only to be infected on the mission and later cured when Prime uses the power of the Matrix to purge the plague. Goldbug also makes a brief appearance in the fourth and final season of the series, defending Autobot City and Cybertron against a massive Decepticon attack.\nIn Transformers: The Headmasters, Goldbug and the Throttlebots were on Cybertron when Vector Sigma began to destabilize as a consequence of Optimus Prime releasing the Matrix's energy to cure the Hate Plague the previous year. The Decepticons soon invaded the planet in an attempt to take control of the computer, and Goldbug and the Throttlebots joined Grimlock and Slag in holding the line against them. Unfortunately, they were knocked unconscious by the hypnotic power of the new Decepticon Headmaster Mindwipe, but they had managed to delay the Decepticons long enough for the Autobot Headmasters to arrive and take up the fight.\nThe Throttlebots disappeared after this encounter, suggesting they might have been destroyed, but they eventually resurfaced months later as the Decepticons were carrying out their final plan to destroy the Earth. Goldbug and the Throttlebots teamed up with Fastlane and Cloudraker to investigate the emergence of a \"Death Tower\" in Santiago, Chile, only to find Predaking there waiting for them. Naturally, the small 'bots were no match for the powerful combiner, but they fought bravely, clinging onto his limbs before being hurled aside. Luckily, the Autobot Targetmasters arrived in time to bail them out and take Predaking down. This is also because of the budget cut that happened in the middle of the movie.\nBumblebee was featured in the 1985 Find Your Fate Junior books Dinobots Strike Back by Casey Todd and Battle Drive by Barbara Siegel and Scott Siegel.\nBumblebee was featured in the 1985 audio and book adventure Satellite of Doom publishing by Kid Stuff Records & Tapes.\nBumblebee was featured in the 1993 Transformers: Generation 2 coloring book Decepticon Madness by Bud Simpson.[3]\nBumblebee has appeared in numerous comic books and related media printed by various publishers.\nBumblebee appeared in the voice actor play performed at BotCon 2004, in which a device built by Rhinox to stop Unicron from pulling victims from other dimensions inadvertently transports an Autobot shuttle under Bumblebee's command into the middle of a battle between Rattrap, Silverbolt, and Waspinator and a team of Unicron's agents. Bumblebee's shuttle is able to scoop up Rattrap and company when their ship is destroyed. After saving more of Unicron's victims from the Decepticons, Bumblebee's team returns to their own time.\nIn a story called \"By their Blasters you shall know them ...!\" from Transformers Comic-Magazin issue #12 by German comic publisher Condor Verlag Optimus Prime instructs Backstreet, Bumblebee and Ruckus on how to identify Autobots from Decepticons in battle using the Ark's computer. Pretender Bumblebee is one of those he displays to the Autobots.[4]\nIn Devil's Due's first G.I. Joe vs. The Transformers crossover, the evil terrorist organization Cobra are the first to uncover the Ark and the Transformers slumbering within it, capturing and reformatting a large number of them to use them as war machines. Bumblebee and Wheeljack are able to avoid this fate, contact the team created to respond to the threat of Cobra, G.I. Joe, and help to free their fellow Autobots. Unlike most Autobots, who had new alternate modes, Bumblebee and Wheeljack had their original Generation 1 alternate modes in this series.\nIn the second crossover, Bumblebee is among the Autobots sent back in time due to an accident with the spacebridge computer Teletran-3. As part of a small group transported to the 1970s, Bumblebee is reformatted as a small economy car (this time, resembling an AMC Pacer) before the teamed-up Joes and Cobras return all the Transformers to present-day Cybertron.\nBumblebee takes center stage in the third crossover series, as he, Grimlock, Arcee, and Perceptor are sent to Earth to aid G.I. Joe in removing the influence of Cybertronian technology on the planet. Sporting his original alternate mode again, he is shown to have something of a crush on Arcee. When Cobra attacks the base, the Autobots help repel the Cobra Battle Android Trooper armies. Journeying to Cybertron to stop Serpentor, the mismatched group is ambushed first by Cannibalizers, then by Serpentor, Piranacon, Predaking and the Stunticons, with Bumblebee being badly injured as he runs right into Predaking's leg. He is then executed by Serpentor, who would later comment that Bumblebee's death is the only thing that ever really made him feel emotion. Despite the character being notoriously difficult to kill, it seems his death is permanent, as Serpentor comments that he felt something leave him, most likely his spark. A statue to his memory was seen in the final issue. His death would continue to have repercussions, as seen in the fourth series, in which Prime insists on journeying to Earth personally rather than expose any of his troops to the same fate.\nWhen Dreamwave Productions introduced their re-imagined version of Generation 1 continuity for the 21st Century, Bumblebee was present for the Autobots' new adventures once again. The War Within, set in Cybertron's past, chronicled Bumblebee's early adventures in the Battle of Altihex and the defense of Iacon in the face of an attack by Shockwave.\nWhen Optimus Prime and Megatron vanish in an early spacebridge experiment, causing the Autobots and Decepticons to splinter into smaller factions, Bumblebee remains with the Autobots under Prowl's command.\nAs usual, Bumblebee is among the Transformers trapped in stasis aboard the crashed Ark who are reactivated on Earth in 1984. Although not depicted in fiction, the general events of the television series pilot seemed to take place in the Dreamwave continuity - with Bumblebee meeting and befriending Spike Witwicky.\nClassic Bumblebee was featured on the cover of Transformers Club Magazine #14.\nIn a possible future chronicled in the exclusive comic book available at BotCon 2005, Bumblebee featured as the espionage director of the Autobots. Having been on the trail of the Decepticon agent Flamewar for a long time, Bumblebee interrupts a communication between Flamewar and the Tripredacus Council and reveals that his agent, Ricochet, has installed a degenerative virus into Deathsaurus's clone army. With Flamewar now exposed, Bumblebee points out that she was nothing more than a liability to the Council, who blow her ship up.\nBased on the Transformers Classics toy line, the Timelines 2007 story is set 15 years after the end of the Marvel Comics story (ignoring all events of the Marvel U.K. and Generation 2 comics). Megatron has survived the crash of the Ark on Earth, reformatted himself into a new form, and now leads Ramjet, Skywarp, Soundwave, Starscream, and the Constructicons. Optimus Prime has also returned to Earth commanding Bumblebee, Cliffjumper, Grimlock, Jetfire, Mirage, and Rodimus (formerly Hot Rod).\nIn Crossing Over, when the Cybertronians Skyfall and Landquake arrive on Earth unexpectedly Megatron attempts to destroy them, but Optimus Prime and his Autobots are able to drive Megatron away.\nBumblebee appears in the story Generation 2: Redux in which he is among the reinforcements from Autobot City to respond to the Decepticon attack at the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland. Once there, the Autobots are able to defeat the Decepticons, but during the fight the Autobots are exposed to refined Forestonite, which enhances and mutates Cybertronian systems. He gets enhanced to his Generation 2 form.[5]\nFall of 2005 was the third re-launch for the Transformers comic series, this time under the management of IDW Publishing.\nIDW's core universe was introduced with the six-issue mini-series, The Transformers: Infiltration, making it clear that the company's take on the Generation 1 universe was radically different. Bumblebee appears as a member of a small team of Autobots under the command of Prowl, operating in secret on Earth out of Ark-19. Still a Volkswagen Beetle, he (like the other Autobots) possesses the added ability to generate a \"holo-matter\" avatar of a young female to masquerade as a driver and to otherwise interact with humans. Working with Ratchet and a trio of young humans to search an abandoned Decepticon base, Bumblebee is able to take down Skywarp during a Decepticon attack, out-thinking the Decepticon and shooting him out of the sky despite his teleportation system. After Blitzwing and Skywarp bring the base down, Bumblebee helps save the humans, despite commenting previously that they would be acceptable losses. As Megatron then engages the traitorous Starscream in battle, Bumblebee does what he does best by spying on the fight; almost shot by the Battlechargers, he is saved by Prowl and Jazz. In the follow-up, The Transformers: Escalation, he is left to run the Ark-19 on his own.\nBumblebee was among the Autobots who opposed the Decepticons serving the elder gods in the IDW Publishing Infestation 2: Transformers comic.[6]\nBumblebee, voiced by Dan Gilvezan, appeared in the TFcon 2009 voice actor play Bee for, Bee now.[7]\nBumblebee appears among the characters in Re-Unification, the 2010 TFCon voice actor play prelude comic.[8]\nBumblebee was one of eight playable characters in the 1986 Commodore 64 video game Transformers: The Battle to Save the Earth.\nThe Classic toy line appeared in a simple Flash-based video game on the Hasbro web site called Transformers Battle Circuit. In this one-on-one fighting game, players press the right and left arrow keys to try to overpower their opponent. Playable characters include Rodimus, Bumblebee, Grimlock, Jetfire, Starscream, Astrotrain, Trypticon, and Menasor. Optimus Prime and Megatron each appear as the boss the player must defeat to win the game.[9]\nBumblebee is one of the light blue robots in the 2010 card game Monopoly Deal Transformers.\nA parody of the Generation 1 Transformers was aired in the December 23, 2008 episode of Frank TV, called \"Frank the Halls\". In the story, Optimus Prime and his Autobots (Bumblebee, Jazz, and Wheeljack) battle Megatron and his Decepticons (Soundwave and Starscream) when Optimus runs out of gas. Optimus becomes enraged at the price of gas, steals the fuel from the annoying hybrid Autobot Prius Maximus, then joins the Decepticons in destroying the city.[10]\nBumblebee appears in the Robot Chicken episode \"Junk in the Trunk\". In the segment he is in, he is whipped by a towel used by Grimlock in the locker room and later appears at Optimus' bedside before he dies of prostate cancer.\nMaggie Simpson appeared as Bumblebee in one episode's opening sequence to The Simpsons alongside the rest of the Simpson family rendered as Autobots.\nBumblebee appears as one of the main Autobot characters in the live-action Transformers film series. He retains some elements from his Generation 1 design, such as the iconic horn-like pieces in his head, which are articulated in the films. The cautious but brave Bumblebee was given a different alternate mode from his original G1 incarnation, instead of a Volkswagen Beetle, he transforms into a rally yellow[12] Chevrolet Camaro (the model year of which is upgraded in the first film). Director Michael Bay states in the special features of DVD 2 of the first film, that the change of Bumblebee's alternate mode was due to the fact that a Volkswagen Beetle reminded him of Herbie. Due to a battle injury, he is rendered effectively mute, and communicates through use of selected playback of radio and television signals. Though his original voice is restored at the end of the first Transformers film, he communicates solely through his radio in Revenge of the Fallen and alternates between his voice and his radio in Dark of the Moon. The biography for the Decepticon Hardtop figure states that he and Bumblebee are old rivals and it was not Megatron who damaged Bumblebee's vocal processor, but a shot from Hardtop's gun. This, however, is in almost direct opposition of the film's prequel.\nBay stated in an early interview that Bumblebee stands about 17.5 feet tall (5.33\u00a0m),[13] but the official guide to the Transformers video game says he is 16 feet tall (4.88\u00a0m).\nThe vehicles used for Bumblebee, Ironhide, Jazz and Ratchet were put on display by General Motors at the 2007 Detroit River Walk Festival a little over a week before the U.S. release of the film.[14]\nIn Hot Rod magazine's Nov. 2006 issue, Bumblebee was a feature article. Originally a worn-out 1969 Camaro, producers settled on a 1977 model.[15] It is painted yellow with black stripes, primer and rust patches, riveted hood scoop, Cragar SS wheels up front, Eric Vaughn Real Wheels in the back, marine-grade vinyl seats, and even an eight-track player. The Camaro Concept model was built using a 2005 Holden Monaro by Saleen, with the body built from the same GM R&D molds that were used in the original 2006 Camaro Concept (the Monaro and Camaro share the same Zeta platform). Early photos show that Bumblebee can transform his right arm into a plasma cannon and has missile launchers in his shoulders. In addition to his firearms, in the game Bumblebee can extend an axe-like \"stinger\" from his wrist, in a similar fashion to how Optimus releases his sword. Bumblebee uses this in close-quarters combat. This weapon was most notable in the video game. The 1977 Camaro movie vehicle was sold on eBay with a winning bid of U.S. $40,100.01.\nAs a tribute to the original form of Bumblebee, a yellow Volkswagen Beetle appears next to him at the car dealership. Bumblebee damages the Beetle in order to ensure that Sam purchases him. He also has a bee-shaped air freshener attached to his rear view mirror with the words \"Bee-otch\". The air freshener was the subject of a lawsuit for $850,000 due to its alleged resemblance to another design.[16]\nSince his conversion from 1977 Camaro to 2006 Camaro Concept, Bumblebee's alternate mode continues to evolve throughout the film series. In Revenge of the Fallen, he sports a different set of alloy wheels (apparently, in the first two films are actually hubcaps made from composite to look like a set of wheel-disc brake[17] ) and a custom front bumper. For Transformers: Dark of the Moon (Now a Camaro SS), his color changes from yellow to amber with thicker black stripes that run across his hood, roof and trunk. In addition, he will have dark-colored rims and side mirrors, as well as a rear spoiler. Also, in Transformers Dark of the Moon, he has a stealth force battle mode in which he can use his weapons in car mode without fully transforming and still being able to seat a driver and passengers.[18]\nIGN described Bumblebee's lubrication of Simmons as one of the worst moments of the Transformers movie.[19]\nIn Transformers: Defiance #1, back on ancient Cybertron, Bumblebee, and Cliffjumper are tasked to watch over the All Spark at the temple at Simfur. In issue #3, Megatron learns that Optimus has broken into his room and sends Bumblebee, Camshaft, Cliffjumper, Jazz, Prowl, and Smokescreen to arrest Optimus Prime for treason. Optimus demands to speak directly to Megatron, but while en route to Megatron's location, they are ambushed by Barricade, Brawl, Crankcase, Frenzy, Starscream, Skywarp, and Thundercracker, under orders to kill them all. Smokescreen is able to cover Optimus and his group's retreat in the confusion of an explosion. In issue #4, Arcee, Bumblebee, Cliffjumper, Jazz, and Smokescreen ambush Ironhide, who they believed works for Megatron, but Ironhide instead joins Optimus Prime's Autobots. Arcee and Bumblebee later spy on the building of the Decepticon starship Nemesis.\nThe Transformers: Movie Prequel reveals that in the battle of Tyger Pax, Megatron's forces attack, searching for the All Spark. Bumblebee's squad (which includes Arcee) attempts to hold off the Decepticons, but are eventually overwhelmed. They are captured and tortured by Swindle, with Megatron intervening personally to torture Bumblebee for information. However, they refuse to speak long enough for Prime's secret plan to take effect - launching the All Spark into outer space. Megatron attempts to pursue it, but Bumblebee stops him. An enraged Megatron rips Bumblebee's arms off and crushes his voice capacitor, promising to seize the All Spark for himself eventually. Bumblebee recovers and is repaired, although his voice is damaged beyond repair. Bumblebee then volunteers to head into space to stop Megatron from acquiring the All Spark.\nEventually arriving on Mars in his protoform mode, Bumblebee then proceeds to Earth in 2003, his arrival tracked by the Hubble space telescope.\nUpon landing in New York City, Bumblebee assumes the form of a beat-up Chevrolet Camaro, all the while avoiding the agents of the government organization known as Sector 7, who refer to him as NBE-2 (or Non-Biological Extraterrestrial 2). Bumblebee then downloads information on Captain Archibald Witwicky. Arriving at the asylum where he had once been incarcerated, he finds it now a dilapidated ruin. Damaged by a pursuing Barricade, he then finds All Spark-like emissions somewhere in New Mexico - unaware it is a trap set by Sector 7. However, their plan to capture him is thwarted when Starscream, Barricade and Blackout arrive. As the Decepticons shoot Sector 7's trap to pieces, Bumblebee escapes - unaware the Decepticons had let him go so that they could follow him and see what he knew about the All Spark. He is last seen in the series heading for Tranquility, Nevada - home of Captain Witwicky's descendant Sam.\nIn the comic adaptation of the film, Bumblebee downloads information on the internet about the Concept Camaro car and took on its form instead of driving past in a tunnel, as seen in the film.\nHe also appears in the official movie sequel comic called The Reign of Starscream.[20]\nIn Transformers: Alliance, the Autobots aid the human soldiers after the battle in Mission City, destroying the All Spark-powered machines that were created. After Ratchet finishes repairing Bumblebee's legs, a trailer is obtained for Optimus Prime to carry the remains of Jazz. The Autobots then leave Mission City before the Sector 7 personnel arrive to claim the remains of the Decepticons. About a month later, Epps and Lennox contact Optimus Prime, Ratchet and Ironhide about aiding them in escorting the remains of the Decepticons to the naval yard. Unknowingly they are spied on by Barricade, who transmitts the information to Starscream.\nBumblebee appears in Transformers: Tales of the Fallen #1, where Barricade kidnaps Sam in order to flush out Bumblebee and learn where the All Spark fragment is. Bumblebee saves Sam and fights Barricade, who escapes in the process.\nBumblebee appears in Transformers: Nefarious #1, set months after the events of the 2009 film. Bumblebee, Breakaway, Jolt, Knock Out and Dune Runner are sent to investigate spark fragments detected at Kingdom Petrochemicals. Arriving first, Breakaway is warned by Soundwave to leave, but unwilling to give in, the Autobot is swiftly defeated. Bumblebee and his team fire on Soundwave, who escapes.\nThe drone calling itself Brains runs into Bumblebee and Sam Witwicky in Philadelphia.[21]\nNote: Events occurring in the alternate universe where Megatron won the battle of Mission City are in italics.\nIn \"Twilight's Last Gleaming Part 3\", Bumblebee attempts to take on Megatron in the Sector 7 base. Meanwhile, Mikaela attempts to free Optimus Prime, but she is attacked by Frenzy.\nBumblebee appears in issue #17 of the Titan Transformers Magazine, in a story called \"Return to Cybertron Part 1\". In this story, he is among the Autobots that go to Cybertron.\nBumblebee returns in issue #22 of the Titan Transformers Magazine series in a story called \"The Decepticon who Haunted Himself.\"\nBumblebee also appears in the prequel novel Transformers: Ghosts of Yesterday. Here, it is revealed he could still communicate with the other Autobots via digital link. Bumblebee is part of Prime's Autobot team searching for the All Spark, and is described as one of the Autobots' best scouts. He is sent after the human vessel Ghost-1 (reverse-engineered from studies of Megatron) to make contact, but is ambushed and forced underground by Starscream. Encountering giant rock-chewing worms, he is saved by Optimus Prime. Heading into the atmosphere once again, he and Ratchet took on Barricade, but are unable to stop Starscream from destroying the human vessel.\nAccording to his extended biography from the Target store exclusive Robo-Vision web site, Hardtop came to Earth and discovered the Witwicky home before any of the other Decepticons, but was unable to attack the Witwickys because Bumblebee found him first and buried him under a hundred tons of rubble in the Rocky Mountains.\nBumblebee appears in the 2007 live-action Transformers movie, returning to his role as the friend of the Autobots' human ally - in this case, Sam Witwicky. Sam possesses the glasses of his great-great-grandfather Captain Archibald Witwicky, a famous explorer. Unknown to Sam, the glasses are engraved with the coordinates showing the location of the life-giving All Spark. Bumblebee is assigned to guard Sam from the Decepticons, and poses as a dilapidated 1977 Chevrolet Camaro as Sam and his father are buying a car for Sam. They eventually purchase Bumblebee, due in no small part to Bumblebee damaging every other car at the dealership to ensure his purchase. Later, Bumblebee drives away from Sam's home to summon the Autobots. Sam thinks Bumblebee is being stolen, and chases the car on his bike. Sam then witnesses Bumblebee transforming into robot mode and reports it to the police, who believe he is on drugs. Bumblebee returns to Sam and his crush Mikaela Banes and protects them from an attack by Barricade and Frenzy, earning Sam's trust. When Mikaela criticizes the poor condition of Bumblebee's vehicle mode, he scans a passing Camaro Concept and transforms into the same model. Bumblebee then drives Sam and Mikaela to an alley where they meet the other Autobots. They return to Sam's house and retrieve the glasses, but a secret government organization, Sector 7, arrests Sam and Mikaela. The Autobots attempt to rescue them but Bumblebee is captured and taken by Sector 7. There he is tested/tortured by the Sector 7 scientists using electric shocks that appear to hurt him. Sam eventually negotiates his release. Bumblebee survives the massive battle at the film's climax, although he loses the use of his legs after helping Ironhide deflect missiles from Starscream. With Mikaela's aid, he is able to rejoin the battle supported by a tow truck (later confirmed to be the Autobot Longarm), and destroys Brawl. After the battle, Bumblebee is fully repaired and asks to stay with Sam and is granted permission from both Sam and Optimus Prime. He is later seen alongside Ironhide, Ratchet, and Optimus watching the sunset while Sam and Mikaela recline on his hood at the end of the movie.\nBumblebee is voiced by Mark Ryan in the films, but he mostly speaks with his radio, having had his voice processor damaged (though his actual voice squeaks and whines laboriously through much of the movie). He also speaks with quotes from television shows and movies, in a way similar to Wreck-Gar from the 1986 film and season three of the G1 cartoon series. Screenwriter Roberto Orci explained Bumblebee regained his voice through the regenerative laser Ratchet fires at his neck as they meet, and it eventually works its magic by the end of the film. He agreed this was not made clear.[22] Frenzy is regenerated upon coming into contact with the All Spark, and so it is entirely plausible that Bumblebee's voice, along with his legs, is also healed by the All Spark, though no mention of this is made in the film. It was said that making Bumblebee mute was to show that his bond with Sam went beyond words.\nBumblebee also appears in the film's sequel, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. When a fragment of the AllSpark inadvertently turns the kitchen appliances in Sam's home into feral robots, Bumblebee intervenes to save him and his family. In doing so, he nearly destroys their house. He still uses his radio to speak, despite his vocal processors being repaired in the first film. However, he does respond half-way when Sam tells him to get in the garage by saying \"whatever.\" Bumblebee shows excitement at the thought of going with Sam to college, only to be disappointed later when Sam tells him that he can not come. Because of the incident at the Witwickys' he is also forced to leave their garage. Soon after Sam begins his semester at college, Bumblebee follows him and tries to alert him to the Decepticon Pretender (named Alice) that is following Sam. As both Sam and Alice are riding inside Bumblebee, the Autobot attempts to warn Sam through his radio. Having failed at this, Bumblebee intentionally brakes hard multiple times and throws Alice around the interior in an attempt to damage the Pretender. Bumblebee then proceeds to spray lubricant over Alice, thereby embarrassing Sam and forcing Alice to flee.\nSoon after Megatron and Scalpel begin to torture Sam, Bumblebee arrives alongside Optimus Prime to fight Megatron, Starscream and Grindor. After Optimus dies, Bumblebee arrives with Sideswipe, Ironhide and Ratchet to cover Sam's escape. As they mourn for Optimus, Sam tells Bumblebee that he has failed the Autobots, but Bumblebee tells Sam through his radio,...\"You are the person I care for most in my life, and if there is anything you need I won't be far away...\" After taking Sam, Mikaela, Leo and Simmons to the Smithsonian museum to reawaken Jetfire, Bumblebee then travels with the humans through a Space Bridge to Egypt (caused by Jetfire) along with Jetfire, the Twins Skids and Mudflap, and Wheelie to find the Matrix of Leadership. While the twins have a sibling argument (resulting in a fist fight) inside the ruins of Petra (which supposedly houses the Matrix when everyone thinks it is a dead end), Bumblebee breaks them up and tosses them out before seeing their fight. But once seeing the Tomb's entrance after the Twins' brawl reveals it, Bumblebee helps the humans enter it by blasting the rest of the wall off.\nDuring the final confrontational battle, Sam and Mikaela inadvertently spring a trap set by Rampage (who uses Sam's parents as the bait). Bumblebee stays hidden from Rampage's sight, allowing Sam to put Rampage in a spot where Bumblebee can initiate a surprise attack. During the subsequent fight Ravage attacks him from behind and jumps on his back. After a brief struggle, Bumblebee gets a hold of Ravage and literally tears him apart with his hands, allowing him to finish off and kill Rampage. With Sam's parents free, Sam tells Bumblebee to take care of them, thus removing him from most of the final fight. After Sam is killed by Megatron, Bumblebee arrives with Sam's parents and sees Sam's body on the ground, he is heartbroken, overcome with sadness and stricken with sorrow, believing that he has failed in his duty to protect Sam, but is overjoyed to see him return. Bumblebee is among the remaining Autobots at the end of the film.\nIn Transformers: Dark of the Moon, Bumblebee no longer lives with Sam and goes on other missions with the Autobots such as dismantling an illegal nuclear facility in the Middle East. This is the first time the stealth force upgrade is shown in the movie. When Sam arrives with Carly, Wheelie and Brains, Bumblebee saves them from the soldiers taking them captive. Bumblebee is reassigned to protect Sam and moves back in with him. Bumblebee later teams up with Sideswipe and Dino/Mirage to take out Hatchet.While Dino/Mirage clings on to hatchet with his grapplers Bumblebee and Sideswipe shoot their stealth force weapons. while trying to protect Sentinel Prime who later attacks him and the other Autobots. After Sentinel forces the Autobots' exile from Earth, Bumblebee sadly says goodbye to Sam and reunites with him in Chicago where he helps him rescue Carly and kill Laserbeak. After Sam kills Starscream, Bumblebee saves him and Lennox from a great fall. Bumblebee is captured by Soundwave and is nearly executed in front of Sam (telling Sam \"We gave them a hell of a run\") after Barricade executes Que before Wheelie and Brains save him at the cost of their own lives, allowing him to break free and attack Soundwave. Bumblebee battles Soundwave while the other Autobots fight the other Decepticons and proves more than a match for the Decepticon spy-master, even managing to kill another Decepticon during the fight. Finally Bumblebee knocks Soundwave off-balance with a shot to the leg, knocks his gun from his hand and uppercuts his cannon into his chest, firing at the same time, destroying Soundwave's head and killing him. Bumblebee fights Sentinel alongside the other Autobots and humans but is no match for him, but avoids injury. After Sam kills Dylan Gould, Bumblebee destroys the Control Pillar by crashing through it, shutting off the Space Bridge and destroying Cybertron and the remaining Decepticons. Bumblebee survives the battle and gives Sam a bunch of gaskets to use as rings while playing wedding music after Sam and Carly admit they love each other. Though Sam says to Bumblebee that he's thinking too fast. He replies by 'saying', \"I'm just trying to help out.\" Ratchet compliments Bumblebee for his bravery.\nBumblebee returns in Transformers: Age of Extinction. He has a new vehicle mode, a modified 1967 Chevrolet Camaro, before he scans a white 2014 Camaro and turns into a modified 2014 Chevrolet Camaro, because of this his robot mode has been changed as well and resembles one design of Bumblebee from the Generation 1 IDW comics.\nIn Cyber Missions 1, Bumblebee and Ironhide are protecting NEST Command when two Decepticons, Soundwave and Bludgeon invade the area. Ironhide goes outside to deal with Bludgeon, while Soundwave ambushes Bumblebee from inside. Bumblebee is easily thrown down by Soundwave. Bumblebee tries to fire a shot from his shoulder gun, but Soundwave redirects the acoustic energy back at him. Bumblebee deduces that he cannot deflect several rounds at once, and begins rapidly firing at Soundwave. The Decepticon is not able to take in so much, and finally falls. Later, Bumblebee traps Soundwave in a magnetically sealed bubble in Cyber Missions 2.\nBumblebee is a playable character, and is the most-used character in the Autobot campaign, where the character uses Bumblebee in nine missions in the Autobot campaign, out of the total 18. He is playable in both the old and new Camaro cars. Bumblebee also appears as a boss in the Decepticon campaign, with a radial blast attack.\nBumblebee is among the playable characters in the 2009 Revenge of the Fallen video game by Activision.[23]\nThe film version of Bumblebee is playable in Hasbro's Net Jet Transformers fighting game Transformers Battle Universe. Although other playable Transformers in the game have several incarnations featured, no other versions of Bumblebee are playable.\nBumblebee is among the characters who appear in the TRANSFORMERS CIBERVERSE Battle Builder Game.[24]\nBumblebee appears among the characters in Re-Unification, the 2010 TFCon voice actor play prelude comic.[25]\nBumblebee is one of the Autobots featured in Transformers: The Ride at Universal Studios theme parks. In the ride, Bumblebee disembodies Ravage while Evac escapes from the Decepticon attack on N.E.S.T. headquarters. Towards the end of the ride, Bumblebee saves Evac from falling off a building after Evac kills Megatron with the AllSpark shard.\nBumblebee appears in the episode of Robot Chicken called \"Tell My Mom\", voiced by Seth Green. Sam Witwicky finds Bumblebee in Bobby Bolivia's used car lot and they go on an adventure, while Scooter is the only thing cheap in the lot. Bumblebee is portrayed as a fifth-generation Camaro.\nBumblebee appears in the Transformers Animated series in 2008 as a yellow Supermini police car (scanned from a vehicle driven by Detroit Police Captain Fanzone). The character of Bumblebee in Animated is described as a hot headed racing young Autobot who likes video games, making him more akin to Armada Hot Shot than the original Bumblebee. He does however retain the traditional warm-heartedness and human-friendly attitude of the original due to his friendship with Sari Sumdac and Bulkhead. Although considered childish and self-centered by many of his fellow Autobots, Bumblebee shows a loyal and caring side for his friends, and can be considered protective of Sari Sumdac, to the extent of blocking shots, blasts,and missiles from harming her. This was first shown in \"Transform and Roll Out! Part 3\" when he deflected a shot from Starscream that was aimed at Sari. The blast rendered him unconscious until Sari healed him with her Key. He is the kid-friendly character of the show.[26]\nBumblebee has a retractable face plate he uses when he goes into combat and a retractable weapon (called \"energy stingers\") in both hands. He can use the wheels on his feet in robot mode as motorized roller blades.\nIn the Japanese translation of Transformers Animated, the story has been changed to make it a prequel to the 2007 Transformers live-action film. This makes this version of Bumblebee an earlier version of the film character.\nIn the episode \"Autoboot Camp\", Bumblebee has flashbacks to his days as an Autobot trainee. During training, he met Bulkhead, Longarm, Ironhide, and Wasp. The group was under the command of Drill sergeant Sentinel Minor, who gave Bumblebee his name (after calling him a \"bumbler\"). Bumblebee would often say or do the wrong thing, resulting in the entire platoon receiving Transformation push-ups as a result, which made him unpopular with Wasp and Ironhide. One day, Bumblebee heard someone communicating with Megatron. Believing the traitor to be Wasp, Bumblebee (with help from Longarm) discovered evidence in Wasp's locker. For discovering the traitor, Sentinel was prepared to give Bumblebee Elite Guard membership. However, Bumblebee gave up that chance by taking the rap for Bulkhead, who had previously knocked a building onto Sentinel, and was about to be removed from training, joining his new friend as a Space Bridge technician. Bulkhead and Bumblebee were assigned to a Space Bridge repair ship under the command of Optimus Prime, along with Ratchet. Both he and Bulkhead were the first to encounter Prowl before he joins their group.\nIn the series finale, during a rescue mission to save Arcee, who was on the moon, Bumblebee manages to settle the score with Shockwave before he and Bulkhead put him under arrest. After the Autobots learn of Prowl's ultimate sacrifice, they take the sparkless body of Prowl and the captured Megatron, Lugnut, and Shockwave to Cybertron. On their arrival home, they are greeted and cheered on by the other Autobots for their victory over the evil and malevolent leader of the Decepticons.\nBumblebee appeared in the 2008 BotCon voice actor play \"Bee in the City\", voiced by Bumper Robinson. In this story Professor Sumdac attempted to create a teleportation system to get the Autobots to Cybertron, but an interaction with Sari's key ended up transporting Optimus Prime, Bumblebee and Sari to Transtech Cybertron, where they met Flareup and his friends were detained by Shockwave while he was deemed not a threat. Bumblebee teamed up with transformer named \"Joe\" to help him and Flareup get their friends. But after Joe exposed himself as a Megatron and uses Sari's key to create an army to begin a reign of terror, Bumblebee pointed out the world's bureaucratic nature that resulted in a mutiny. Afterwards the Autobots and Sari returned to their own dimension.\nSet shortly after the events of \"Total Meltdown\" is the Transformers: Animated comic issue #2 by IDW Publishing. In it, Bumblebee and Prowl apprehend the Angry Archer as the villain attempts to steal money from a used car salesman. In doing so, they reveal the holographic trickery of the Detroit super hero known as The Wraith. With the secret of his power revealed, The Wraith loses much of the respect he used to command in Detroit. The Wraith attempts to stop Cyrus \"The Colossus\" Rhodes from escaping prison, but is unable to fool the villain now that the secret is public, forcing the Autobots to stop Rhodes and making The Wraith look foolish. The Wraith then attempts to discredit Bumblebee at a college football game by trapping the Autobot with a car boot and using his holograms to make a fake Bumblebee attack the stadium. Bumblebee eventually escapes and the other Autobots help capture The Wraith before having him placed in a mental institution.\nBumblebee is one of the five playable characters in the 2008 Transformers Animated video game for the Nintendo DS.[27][28]\nBumblebee is one of the main group of Autobots in the 2010 computer-animated series Transformers: Prime.[29]\nBumblebee is younger than most of the Autobots, and lost his voice box thanks to Megatron during the Great War. Bumblebee remains more playful than the other Autobots despite his lack of voice, and has come to rely on his speed as his most valuable asset in battle. Bumblebee is extremely similar to his movie counterpart, sharing similar vehicle and robot forms, the same lack of voice, and his close relationship to a human boy. It is also revealed in the series finale episode \"Deadlock\" that Bumblebee's mouth was covered by a face plate vaguely resembling that of Optimus Prime's that helped him to create the alternative beeping noises he uses as his main form of communication throughout the series. Later in the series he changes his color scheme by reversing the colors.\nBumblebee appears in the novels Transformers: Exodus and Transformers: Exiles.\nBumblebee losing his voice was the focus of the short story \"Bumblebee at Tyger Pax\" By Alex Irvine.[30]\nBumblebee appears as a playable character in the 2010 video game Transformers: War for Cybertron. In the Autobot campaign, he is first seen racing across the war-torn streets of Iacon in search of Optimus. Upon rendezvousing with Optimus, he relays the message of Zeta Prime's death at the hands of Megatron; after which, he joins Optimus and Ratchet in their resistance against the Decepticons on the planet.\nIn Transformers: Fall of Cybertron, the sequel to War for Cybertron, players start as Bumblebee in the first level. He appears throughout the game as well.\nBumblebee appears in the pilot episode of the series responding too late to a call for help from Cliffjumper, who is captured by the Decepticons and killed. Bumblebee soon is assigned to be Raf Esquivel's guardian, having grown close to the boy as he understands his language of beeps.[31] In the \"Operation: Bumblebee\" two-parter, Bumblebee lost his transformation cog and its ability to have him transform before eventually retrieving the cog from human terrorist group M.E.C.H. and Starscream.\nBumblebee's goal in the series is to be promoted to warrior class, as he first states in \"Masters & Students\", however, Optimus does not believe him to be worthy of promotion at such a young age. Nevertheless, Bumblebee shows he is still a capable warrior, able to fight the likes of Breakdown and Shockwave. When questioned by Smokescreen in \"Project Predacon\", Bumblebee admits he is holding back so that he can one day be promoted to warrior class on Cybertron.\nIn \"Deadlock\", during the final battle aboard the Nemesis, Bumblebee tries to give Optimus Prime the Star Saber for him to fight Megatron, but is killed by Megatron. However, Bumblebee fell into ship's Omega Lock and exposure to the synthetic energon powering it both revived him and restored his voice. As Megatron prepared to finish Optimus, Bumblebee used the Star Saber to stab him in his spark, killing him. Afterwards, once the Omega Lock restored Cybertron, Bumblebee gives Raf a goodbye before leaving for his home world where the he is finally promoted to warrior class during the series finale Predacons Rising. However, things quickly turn for the worse when Unicron appears on Cybertron in Megatron's body, and two new Predacons are cloned by Shockwave. With Optimus on a mission to retrieve the AllSpark, and Ultra Magnus having been severely wounded by the new Predacons, Bumblebee becomes Autobot leader at Ratchet's encouragement as he leads them, the newly defected Knock Out and the three Predacons in making a stand against Unicron's undead Predacon army at the Well of All Sparks, buying enough time for Optimus to return to defeat Unicron. Optimus reveals that he must sacrifice himself to restore the AllSpark to Cybertron's core, and does not pass on leadership to any one person present, stating that leadership will now be earned through actions. Bumblebee promises to keep the peace on Cybertron to Optimus, implying Bumblebee to be the new leader of the Autobots and by extension Cybertron's new age.\nBumblebee will appear as the main character of the upcoming sequel series Transformers: Robots in Disguise, with Will Friedle reprising his role. In the series, Bumblebee is called to Earth when a new generation of Decepticons re-emerges on the planet. Bumblebee will gather up a team of ragtag Autobots, including a rebel bad boy bot named Sideswipe, a hyper active Mini-Con named Fixit, a bombastic Dinobot, and an Elite Guard cadet, in order to combat the Decepticons.\nBumblebee appears in the episode \"Bumblebee to the Rescue\", where he helps the Rescue Bots and their human partners investigate a fallen meteor. Optimus Prime briefly assigns Bumblebee to observe how the Rescue Bots and the Burns family work together. Cody and the rest of the Burns family are unable to understand Bumblebee and requires one of the Rescue Bots to translate. The Rescue Bot Blades also happens to be a big fan of Bumblebee (who is said to be a legendary scout and war hero by the Rescue Bots). When Heatwave, Boulder, and Chase are infected by a substance contained in the meteor, Bumblebee, Blades, and the Burns family work together to destroy the meteor and obtain a sample in a hope to find a cure. Bumblebee and Blades successfully destroy the meteor and retrieve the sample, but at the cost of being infected as well, but thankfully the Burns use an analyzes of the meteor sample to find a cure in the Autobots database, curing Bumblebee and the Rescue Bots. At the end of the episode, Cody is revealed to have learned how to understand Bumblebee. Before leaving Bumblebee asks the Burns (with Cody acting as interpreter) if they can take a picture of him and Blades.\nBumblebee returns with Optimus Prime in \"It's a Bot Time\" and \"Bots to the Future\", where they go back in time to save the Rescue Bots from Dr. Morocco. They return to an alternate present with Dr. Morocco ruling Griffin Rock. They fight Morbots, while the Rescue Bots go into the city. They find out they left Dilther behind, which is how the Morbot army exists. They go back in time to take him back to the present, which is then changed back to the regular timeline.\nBumblebee is an Autobot warrior, and is based on the Generation 1 version of the character.\n'Sup?

The menu above and on the left will take you to the major sections of the web site. If you are not sure which page you should be looking at try the search box at the top right of this, and every page. \nBumblebees\nBumblebees are large, hairy social insects with a lazy buzz and clumsy, bumbling flight. Many of them are black and yellow, and along\n        with ladybirds and butterflies are perhaps the only insects that almost everyone likes. \nQueen and worker bumblebees can sting, and the photograph above right shows the extended sting of a Bombus lapidarius  queen.  You don't often see stings as bumblebees are reluctant to use them, and in all my years of working with them I have yet to be stung.  For more on stings go to the sting page. \nIt is believed that the earliest fossilized bumblebee dates from the Oligocene, around 30 million years ago.\n It has been widely reported that Einstein said that without bees to pollinate our food crops humans would die off in just 4 years.  Apparently Einstein never said this at all. It is just another urban myth. However if bees do die off it is fairly certain that life as we know it will cease with in a short time, and that there will be far fewer humans around, as there will be so much less for them to eat. So a world without bees will probably also be a world with far fewer humans. \nFor more on what we are doing to our world you can read my rant on global warming and pollution at the bottom of the Invertebrate page. \nBumblebees are\n        found mainly in northern temperate regions, though there are a few native South\n        American species and New Zealand has some naturalised species that were\n        introduced around 100 years ago to pollinate red clover. They range much\n        further north than honey bees, and colonies can be found on Ellesmere Island in\n        northern Canada, only 880 km from the north pole! \nWith the recent\n        popularity of using bumblebees in glasshouse pollination they will probably be\n        found in most parts of the world before long (see below), especially Bombus\n          terrestris which seems to be the most popular species sold for this\n        purpose.\nRecently there have\n        been proposals to introduce bumblebees into Australia to pollinate crops in\n        glasshouses. Now, though I dearly love bumblebees, I do think that this might\n        not be a very good idea. No matter what security measures are taken, mated\n        queens WILL escape eventually and that will probably lead to their\n        establishment in the wild. And yet another non-native invasion of a country\n        that has suffered more than most from such things. This invasion may or may not\n        be benign, but isn't it better to err on the side of caution?\nApparently there are already colonies of Bombus terrestris on Tasmania, so I suppose it is now only a matter of time before they reach the mainland. \n\n      above the sting of a Bombus lapidarius queen, and below a Bombus terrestris/lucorum worker foraging.\nList of crops pollinated by bumblebees. \nPink38 is the name\n              of the bumblebee pictured on the right.

I saw her another 10 times over\n              the next few days, always on the same clump of thistles, or on a nearby clump\n              of Centaurea nigra (knapweed). \nPink38 wasn't special in any way. I\n              marked, measured tongue length, head length and width of 232 bumblebees between the 2nd and 6th of August 1995, and saw 58.6%\n              again at least once. \nA week or two later, after I'd finished all the work for my BSc Hons thesis, I went out with my camera to\n              find the lane still full of bumblebees with numbers on their backs. Pink38 was\n              just outside the door as usual, on her clump of thistles, so I took her photograph.\nEverything you read on this site stems from that summer measuring tongue lengths, marking, following and recording flowers visited by bumblebees foraging in a farm lane in North East Scotland.

Although he is not the strongest or most powerful of the Autobots, Bumblebee more than makes up for this with a bottomless well of luck, determination and bravery. He would gladly give his life to protect others and stop the Decepticons.\n\nBadly damaged in battle, Bumblebee lost the ability to speak verbally, though he can still communicate over inter-Autobot frequencies (in a fashion that seems somewhat akin to instant messaging, a usable but more distant and less personal means of interaction). He can also communicate with the Autobots' human allies and his friend, Sam Witwicky, by playing audio clips from popular media on his radio.\n\nMany years in the past, Bumblebee was hatched among the second generation since the rediscovery of the AllSpark and revival of Cybertron. Movie Prequel #1 He and Cliffjumper were guardians of the AllSpark at the Temple of Simfur. One day, Bumblebee wondered aloud why Optimus and Lord High Protector Megatron were out investigating the nearby excavation site when the AllSpark was \"freaking\" out with energy spikes. Cliffjumper assured him that whatever Optimus and the others were investigating, it must have been important, then reminded his colleague that they had their duties. When Bumblebee admitted nerves, Cliffjumper said that the two of them could handle anything, and just to let trouble come to them. He would soon regret those words when aliens attacked Simfur. They were seeking cover inside the temple when Lord Megatron swooped in, berated them for not taking the fight to the enemy and destroyed their opponent. He then told commander Starscream to keep the lowly security guards out of the way of the military. Defiance #1\n\nBumblebee was concerned this was the start of something big, to which Cliffjumper agreed, but he felt that as little cogs in the great machine, all they needed to do was stand guard. Prowl advised them to stay at their posts and report to him of any unusual activity from the AllSpark during the battle. Defiance #2\n\nAfter the relic informed Megatron of Optimus' break and enter of his personal quarters, Bumblebee, Smokescreen, Cliffjumper, Camshaft, Jazz and Prowl were sent to the ruins near Burthov to arrest Optimus Prime's party on trumped-up charges of treason. When Optimus angrily demanded to know just what he had done to be charged with treason, Bumblebee pointed his weapon at the science leader and said they were just following orders, which seemed to satisfy Optimus. What the security officers didn't know was they were being led into a trap, and soldiers loyal to Megatron were under orders to eliminate all but Optimus. After being hit by an explosive round, the group banded together, realising they had all been marked for death. Optimus ordered them to flee to Burthov while he took care of Starscream's group personally. Defiance #3 Bumblebee hauled Arcee from the wreckage. Foundation #3\n\nWhile on an apparent scouting mission, Bumblebee and Arcee discovered the Nemesis while it was under construction and reported their findings back to Prowl. Then Bumblebee transformed into a ball and Arcee transformed into a hover-bike and they both headed back to base. When the Nemesis was completed, Bumblebee and Arcee were there once again to witness the majority of the Decepticon forces board and take off for parts unknown to them.\n\nWith the bulk of the war-like Decepticons gone into space, the Autobots were able to hold their own in their resistance to Megatron's rule, but the war was ever-escalating in intensity, leading to increasing casualties and devastation to Cybertron. Defiance #4 Bumblebee was part of an assault on Simfur Temple to activate Sentinel Prime's \"torch\" that he promised would end the war, Foundation #3 but when Starscream blew up Sentinel's ship, Bumblebee retreated with the rest of the Autobots. However, the battle had weakened Decepticon forces to the extent that the Autobots were soon able to steal the AllSpark. Foundation #4\n\nOptimus Prime made the desperate decision to launch the AllSpark into space. This decision took Bumblebee by surprise, but he supported Optimus. Defiance #4 Bumblebee commanded the Autobot forces at Tyger Pax on Cybertron attempting to hold the Decepticons off while the AllSpark was launched off-planet. He succeeded, but Megatron crushed his voice box, and he lost his ability to speak in the process. Ratchet has been having trouble fixing it ever since. Bumblebee was declared a hero for his actions, but he feared that all they had done was potentially spread their war to other worlds. Movie Prequel #1\n\nLater, he was the first to track the AllSpark to Earth, making planetfall in 2003. Here, he learned to express his emotions by tuning in appropriately emotive music on his car radio. Though the clandestine human organization Sector Seven tracked his descent Movie Prequel #2 and secured the area in Virginia where he landed, his quick assumption of a local alternate mode disguise allowed him to escape via Interstate 64. Bumblebee's search for the AllSpark began in St. Louis, Missouri, where he used a remote link to a coffee shop computer to search Shwiggle for any signs of extra-terrestrial sightings. There, he discovered the legend of the Ice Man, and the story of Captain Archibald Witwicky. Movie Prequel #3\n\nBumblebee's quest took him to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where Captain Witwicky had been committed. First he visited the ruins of the long-abandoned Psychopathic Institute for the Long-Term Insane, Witwicky's final home. Movie Prequel #4 From there, Bumblebee headed into downtown, where he scanned the records of Captain Witwicky from an unnamed asylum. This action unfortunately put Sector Seven onto his trail.\n\nThe Baton Rouge clues led Bumblebee to Springfield, Missouri, in search of Witwicky's son Clarence. En route, he evaded the first of several attacks by Sector Seven. In Springfield, he found records of Clarence's descendants, and started out to track them down. The oldest son, Ben, had resided in Denver, Colorado, but the trail ended there. En route to his next stop in Tucson, Bumblebee was again attacked by Sector Seven, evading their helicopters by blinding them and rocketing off at high speed. Not long after, he was attacked by Barricade in the desert. Interlude\n\nDamaged and smoking, Bumblebee stopped by the roadside to rest and recover. Suddenly detecting a burst of AllSpark energy, he continued onwards out of Colorado. In New Mexico, as he approached the source of the AllSpark energy, he came under attack once again from Barricade. Other Decepticons, meanwhile, attacked the energy source and found it to be a Sector Seven ruse. Bumblebee managed to escape Barricade again, though unbeknownst to him the Decepticons let him go so that they could track him. Eventually, his search took him to Tranquility, Nevada, Movie Prequel #4 where he would soon encounter Sam Witwicky.\n\nOptimus Prime entrusted Bumblebee with the secret that the AllSpark would be sent into deep space to prevent Lord Megatron from possessing and corrupting it. Just after the launch, Megatron attacked Bumblebee in rage at losing the AllSpark and shattered the Autobot's voice capacitor beyond repair. \n\nBumblebee arrived on Earth and, sensing the AllSpark was near, took on local camouflage to search for the artifact. He immediately attracted the attention of Sector Seven agents and the Decepticons.  Transformers: Beginnings\n\nBetween Tyger Pax and his arrival on Earth, Bumblebee and the rest of the Ark crew encountered an alien ship, the Ghost 1, in an abandoned solar system. After the ship turned tail and headed for one of the planet, Optimus sent Bumblebee down after it. Bumblebee located the ship, and was about to approach it when Starscream arrived, and he was forced to retreat under the Decepticon's superior firepower. Shortly after discovering some apparently artificial pillars, the ground gave way, and Bumblebee found himself plunged into a cave system. With his radio damaged, he explored the caves, and encountered giant worm creatures. Though they were only organic, they had managed to back him into a corner by the time Optimus arrived to rescue him.\n\nThe pair had a brief encounter with Starscream and the Ghost 1, the crew of which had been persuaded by the Decepticon that the Autobots were the aggressors in the Transformer war. Optimus and Bumblebee retreated back below ground, and later found the Ghost 1 in a battered state, having been abandoned by Starscream. Bumblebee made contact with it, and the earlier misunderstanding was soon cleared up. When more of the worm creatures turned up, Bumblebee acted as a diversion so Optimus could blast a way out of the caves, and everyone escaped intact. They returned to the Ark in time to fight the Decepticons once more. Bumblebee joined Ratchet in attacking Barricade, though the Decepticon gave them more than enough trouble. Ghosts of Yesterday\n\nBumblebee, having made his way to a second-rate car dealership, became Sam Witwicky's first car. Sam's father promised his son a car if Sam paid half of the money and achieved three A's in school. After doing so with the help of his genealogy project, Sam rode with his father to a car lot with an exceedingly long name. Following them to the lot, Bumblebee quietly placed himself among the other cars. To prevent Sam from having to choose another car, he used a high-frequency sound wave to blow out the windows of every other car in the lot, leaving Bobby Bolivia with no choice but to sell Bumblebee to the Witwickys.\n\nThe next day, Sam and his friend Miles Lancaster drove Bumblebee down to the lake in a misguided attempt to impress the popular girls at a party. Observing the exchange of thinly veiled insults between Sam and the football jocks, Bumblebee decided to help out Sam when the boy noticed Mikaela Banes walking home after a falling-out with her now ex-boyfriend. Playing \"Drive\" on his radio, Bumblebee inspired Sam to kick Miles out and drive Mikaela home. As the two awkwardly chatted, Bumblebee suddenly turned off his engine when they neared a romantic spot overlooking the city, this time playing \"Sexual Healing\" and \"I Feel Good\". Not knowing his car has a mind of its own, Sam misinterpreted this as a breakdown. Mikaela attempted to fix Bumblebee with her mechanical know-how, only to leave after Sam asked her why she tolerated jerks like her ex-boyfriend. Trying to help as much as he could, Bumblebee allowed Sam to start up his engine as she walked away, this time playing \"Baby, Come Back\". Arriving at Mikaela's house, Sam advanced a step towards her by stating that he didn't believe her to be shallow at all, that there was \"more than meets the eye\" with her. After she left, Sam quietly enthused that he loved his car.\n\nLater that night, Bumblebee drove off by himself with Sam in hot pursuit, believing it to be a car theft. Unwittingly leading his human owner to a junkyard, Bumblebee transformed and activated his communications beacon, requesting assistance from Optimus Prime and the other Autobots. Unknown to him, Sam had seen his robot form and run off, and was now being being pursued by the junkyard's two guard dogs. Bumblebee came to Sam's aid, scaring off the dogs, but had to escape when the police (whom Sam had previously summoned when Bumblebee drove away from his house) arrived to arrest Sam for breaking into the junkyard. \n\nThe next day, Bumblebee drove back to the Witwicky house sometime after Sam had been bailed out by his dad. Frightened and confused, Sam rode away from what he dubbed \"Satan's Camaro\", ending up in the city and encountering Mikaela in front of a Burger King. Bumblebee followed Sam towards an industrial area, not realizing that the Decepticon Barricade was stalking the boy, intent on finding glasses belonging to Sam's ancestor, which Sam had been auctioning on eBay Sam ran away from the attacking Decepticon and literally ran into Mikaela after she had followed him. As Barricade bore down on the pair, Bumblebee suddenly appeared, knocking the Decepticon off his feet, then drove the humans away as Barricade gave chase.\n\nRacing through dilapidated factories and warehouses, Bumblebee eventually arrived at a deserted chemical plant on the outskirts of town. There he waited until Barricade's back was turned before dumping Sam and Mikaela out of his passenger side door, then transforming into robot mode to protect his friends. Barricade transformed and attacked, hitting Bumblebee with his tire spikes and knocking the Autobot into a chemical tank. In retaliation, Bumblebee grabbed Barricade and threw him into an electrical substation, but Barricade rolled over and grabbed Bumblebee's head and began to pound him.  Eventually, Bee was able to damaging the Decepticon and put him into stasis lock. After Sam and Mikaela took care of Frenzy, Bumblebee introduced himself to them entirely through the use of his radio, explaining that it was the only way he could communicate, that he was an alien, and that Sam had witnessed him calling to his friends the previous night. Transforming back into vehicle mode, Bumblebee invited his friends to enter (which they did after a brief hesitation) and began to drive them to nearby Griffith Observatory.\n\nOn the way, Mikaela (who had refused to sit in the driver's seat, as Bumblebee was driving), rhetorically asked Sam that if Bumblebee was a super-advanced robot, why did he turn into a piece-of-crap Camaro? Mildly insulted, Bumblebee stopped in the middle of a packed tunnel and forced the humans out, then drove away. As Sam lamented the fact that \"four thousand dollars just drove off\", Bumblebee passed another car and scanned it, driving back to the pair as a sleek and shiny 2009 Camaro. Amazed and impressed, Sam and Mikaela got back in, and Bumblebee continued their journey to the observatory. Arriving, the humans observed as the other Autobots entered the Earth's atmosphere and crash-landed in various parts of the city.\n\nBumblebee then took his friends to a secluded alleyway, where Sam and Mikaela met the other Autobots. Introducing themselves, Sam learned that Bumblebee was his guardian and that the Autobot's vocal processors had been damaged in battle. Ratchet was still working on them as he fired a regenerative plasma beam[1] at the damaged area. Optimus Prime explained that their mission was to find the AllSpark, and that Sam Witwicky was the key due to his grandfather discovering Megatron on an Arctic voyage. \n\nArriving at the Witwicky residence, Bumblebee attempted to convince his comrades to remain out of sight while Sam was talking to his father. When Sam and Mikaela were captured by Sector Seven, Bumblebee helped rescue them. The interrogation of Agent Simmons went nowhere, however, and Bumblebee became so annoyed with his attitude that he released lubricant onto the agent. Soon, Sector Seven reinforcements arrived, intent on recapturing the kids and any \"N.B.E.s\" they could get their hands on. Optimus Prime tried to protect Sam and Mikaela as they hid under a bridge, but both almost fell to their deaths when they slipped. Bumblebee raced forward, transforming and catching them in mid-air. Unfortunately, this also gave Sector Seven a clear and obvious target for them to attack. Firing harpoon cables from helicopters, the clandestine human organization dragged Bumblebee to the ground, and its soldiers began to freeze the helpless Autobot, who reached out to Sam. The boy broke free from an agent's grip, pushing the soldiers aside until he was tackled by several agents and taken away. Though Jazz objected to allowing Sector Seven to leave with their friend, Optimus Prime ordered his troops to stand down, as there was no way to save the prisoners without incurring human casualties.\n\nTaken to Hoover Dam, Bumblebee was continually doused with cryoblasts to keep him docile and inert as Sector Seven performed experiments on him. Sam and Mikaela (with some armed persuasion from Captain Lennox) convinced Sector Seven to release Bumblebee. Upon his release, Bumblebee converted to battle mode and almost lashed out at his human oppressors until Sam calmed him down, informing him of the presence of the AllSpark and Megatron in the facility, and that the Decepticons were coming for both. Following the humans to the AllSpark's chamber, Bumblebee hesitantly reached out to the life source of his people and reformatted it, shrinking the cube until it was a size that the humans could manipulate. Bumblebee and a military escort fled to Mission City, meeting the Autobots en route.\n\nSoon after they arrived at the city, Starscream appeared. Recognizing the Decepticon, Ironhide and Bumblebee lifted up an abandoned truck in order to shield the humans from any collateral damage Starscream's attack would inevitably bring. One of the Decepticon's missiles struck the truck, sending both Autobots flying, with Bumblebee landing in a store front. The attack tore off Bumblebee's legs and left him barely functional, as Sam discovered to his horror when Bumblebee crawled from the wreckage. Soon, the other Decepticons arrived, led by Megatron, and the remaining Autobots were engaged. Mikaela and Sam hoisted Bumblebee onto an abandoned tow truck, but refused to leave his side. The Autobot silently handed his friend the AllSpark, trusting the fate of his people into the boy's hands, and urged him to run while he still could. As Sam ran off, Mikaela drove Bumblebee away from the fighting to relative safety.\n\nHowever, she was soon overcome with guilt for leaving Sam and the battle. With Bumblebee's assent, she turned the truck around and headed back in. As Mikaela drove down the street in reverse, Bumblebee activated his weapon systems, then fired his plasma cannon and missiles at Devastator, who was pinning down Captain Lennox and the rest of the combined Ranger/Sector Seven soldiers. His contribution was the deciding factor, confusing Devastator enough for the soldiers to counterattack, and the Decepticon was destroyed at last when Bumblebee's final cannon blast pierced his spark. Bumblebee was rather pleased with himself, and Mikaela complimented his shooting.\n\nAfter the destruction of Megatron and the AllSpark, Bumblebee (who had regained his voice)[1] requested permission to remain with Sam, to which the young man agreed. After his legs were repaired, he allowed Sam and Mikaela to make out on top of him as the other Autobots watched as Optimus sent his message to space for other Autobots. Transformers\n\n\n\nIn an alternate reality, it was the crappiest day ever because Sam failed and was killed, and Megatron went on to conquer much of the Earth. Bumblebee liked to believe that there was a universe out there in which Megatron lost. \n\nBumblebee and Mikaela went on to become old comrades in guerrilla warfare, and in 2008 went on a mission to rescue Optimus Prime from a Decepticon bunker in Denver. Bumblebee, now with missile launchers in car mode and increased physical strength, took out the bunker guard, Swindle, (nearly crushing Mikaela by accident\u2014\"My bad.\") and found Prime...or what was left of him. Twilight's Last Gleaming, Part: 1 Now stuck in the base, Bumblebee was being hunted by Megatron, Twilight's Last Gleaming, Part: 2 and baited into revealing himself when the tyrant threatened to kill Mikaela. Bumblebee made a desperate attack, only to be beaten aside with ease. Twilight's Last Gleaming, Part: 3\n\nDespite his defeat, he remained defiant to the end and refused to beg for mercy. Luckily the Autobot reinforcements arrived; unluckily, they couldn't stop Megatron; luckily again, Mikaela had revived Optimus Prime to save them Twilight's Last Gleaming, Part: 4 and arrived with Phase Two of their plan, a Sector Seven nanovirus that targeted AllSpark energy. Plugging it to himself, Bumblebee charged at the super-powered Megatron and forcibly uploaded the nano-virus, killing the tyrant once and for all. Not that he patted himself on the back over this, for he knew too well that this just left a power vacuum... Twilight's Last Gleaming, Part: 5\n\nStill partnered with Mikaela near the Savannah, Georgia refugee camp post-occupation, Bumblebee appeared frustrated with how the humans were frightened of him and, to be listened to, Mikaela had to do the talking for him. Transformers Comic issue 14 They went back into battle again to end a NATO bombardment of the Autobots in Savannah, running a gauntlet of tanks and Thundercrackers before freeing the NATO field commander from Decepticon mind control. During the course of the battle he roasted a drone with fiery exhaust. Aftermath Part 2\n\nFollowing this battle, Bumblebee was involved in many clashes with Decepticons to protect human infrastructure, including leading a small group to protect an oil pipeline in Alaska. Armorhide did not follow orders well.  Dark Spark\n\nFollowing that, he was sent with Arcee and Armorhide to Cybertron, under Ironhide's command. The mission was to retrieve Nucleon. Bumblebee was ordered to do recon and discovered a strange satellite dish, but investigating it saw the team jumped by Stockade. Then a strange energy anomaly appeared in orbit, and when Bumblebee asked what it was, Stockade babbled \"BLBLBLBLBBL!\". Return to Cybertron: Part 1 Bumblebee's subsequent attempt at dialogue (after first convincing Ironhide to stop throwing his face at Stockade's fists) was more successful, finding out the anomaly was a living entity the Decepticons had deliberately summoned, believing it would rejuvenate Cybertron.\n\nNot trusting this entity and wanting to stop all the Nucleon being used up, Bumblebee organised the Autobots to create a distraction while he snuck around and turned the Nucleon transfer off. He also intended to send a message to Optimus, and considering the entity was Unicron the Anti-Life, it's a good thing he did. Return to Cybertron: Part 2 In the resulting chaos, Bumblebee had Divebomb barge past him, had to rescue Ironhide from rubble, and found out the guy wanted to stop Unicron by destroying the world. He wasn't having a good day. Return to Cybertron: Part 3\n\nThe day improved when Optimus arrived with a better plan: Cut off the Nucleon that Unicron's body was using for power. Bumblebee and Armorhide were dispatched to drain the Nucleon seam. This took too long, though, so Ratchet came up with a quicker alternative. Return to Cybertron: Part 4\n\nUpon returning to Earth, the Autobots found the Decepticons had pinched their base and all 600 square miles around it. They retreated, leaving Mikaela in Decepticon hands; Bumblebee was distraught over this. Hard Target He would be part of the raid to get her back, knowing and ignoring that it was an obvious trap due to how much they owed Mikaela. The raid was successful and the two were reunited, awwww! The Decepticon Who Haunted Himself\n\nIt didn't last long, with the Decepticon-blackmailed American government ordering the Autobots out; Bumblebee got dispatched with Ironhide on a mission related to this. The next day, Bumblebee got one last hour with Mikaela (and to beat up Dropkick as an \"up yours\" gesture) before joining the Autobots in departing... and then they got nuked! Revolution Part 1\n\nOptimus had anticipated this though, and the Autobots faked their deaths with a decoy ship. Bumblebee, however, couldn't tell Mikaela this due to a decision to minimise any possible exposure. He was part of the spearhead team on return to Earth, intended to raise the Decepticon Heartland and teleport all the enemy there to the dead Cybertron. Mikaela was not happy to see him back, feeling they'd kept the plan from her because they didn't fully trust her to not be captured; Bumblebee tried to deny this.\n\nIn the final battle, Bumblebee 'tagged' Megatron and so is responsible for the tyrant being exiled forever\u2014third time lucky!\n\nIn the aftermath, after it became clear the Autobots had just exiled themselves to Earth forever\u2014\"Hey, there are worse fates,\" said Bumblebee\u2014Mikaela forgave Bumblebee. Both had a lot of clean-up work to do, but also a brave new world to explore together...! Revolution Part 3\n\nAt some point, Bumblebee let his guard down and the Decepticons took advantage by taking out an Autobot communications hub.  He apologized for his lapse. Transformers: Rise of the Chevy Autobots\n\nBumblebee and Hardtop, as two opposing elite spies, have crossed paths many times across the galaxy in a grueling test of endurance. Lately Hardtop has been taking this rivalry very personally, turning it into a vendetta. It was a crack shot by Hardtop that damaged Bumblebee's vocal processors, causing the Autobot pain when he tries to speak. Hardtop\n\nDuring the Mission City battle, Bumblebee required assistance and had to be towed to safety by Longarm. Towed to Safety\n\nWith the initial threat over, Bumblebee decided to kick back and relax. Transcanning a rally car, he began hanging around at race tracks, pitting himself against the human racers. Rally Rocket Bumblebee\n\nHe would later be sent on a mop-up duty, hunting Scorponok across the Middle East. Bumblebee vs. Scorponok\n\nEventually, with pictures of him all over the internet, Bumblebee found to his discomfort that everyone recognised him... including newly arriving Decepticons, which put Sam and others in danger! With Mikaela's help, Bumblebee recoloured himself to help restore his disguise and make it easier to sneak up on the enemy. Stealth Bumblebee\n\nBumblebee defended Sam and Mikaela from an encroaching Barricade, who sought to capture the humans. Transformers Mix & Match\n\n\nShortly after the battle in Mission City, Bumblebee's injuries were tended to by Ratchet while Ironhide and Captain Lennox's men searched for the creatures inadvertently created by the AllSpark's energy. After his legs were attached, he rolled out with the Autobots to escape Sector Seven's inquiries. A month later, when asked by Lennox, Optimus Prime informed the human that Bumblebee had resumed his role as Sam Witwicky's protector. Alliance #1\n\nBumblebee accompanied the other Autobots to escort the convoy transporting the dead Decepticons to a navy base in San Diego, California, where they would be taken out to sea and dumped. Optimus Prime gave the surviving AllSpark sliver to Professor Vine of Sector Seven, but after deciding this was a bad idea later on, he sent Ironhide and Bumblebee back to the Nevada facility to retrieve it. Bumblebee raced ahead and arrived to inadvertently save Starscream's life by disarming the revived Wreckage. A grateful Starscream shot Bumblebee as he was protecting the humans, Alliance #2 leaving his vocal processor damaged. Though Ironhide praised him for his bravery and selflessness, Bumblebee regretted not being able to save everybody. By the time the Navy and the Autobots were out at sea to bury Jazz and dump the Decepticon corpses, Ratchet had repaired Bumblebee's body (giving him a modified vehicle mode in the process), but was evidently unable to fully restore his vocal processor. In an effort to prevent mistakes of the past occurring again and to protect Earth, the Autobots and the United States Military formed a special unit under Major Lennox and Optimus Prime's command. When the Decepticon Swindle was detected in San Francisco, Bumblebee and the others rolled out from Diego Garcia. Alliance #3\n\nAfter Optimus Prime destroyed a surprised Dead End, Bumblebee chased Swindle onto the deserted Golden Gate Bridge. Though cornered, the Decepticon was amused that they had sent his old nemesis Bumblebee against him, and quickly set to clobbering the Autobot. Major Lennox distracted the Decepticon, allowing Bumblebee to pay Swindle back for his inept attempt to torture him thousands of years ago. On the plane trip back to Diego Garcia, Lennox and Optimus agreed that Sam Witwicky would become the target of the Decepticons again, and that he must be protected. Bumblebee was chosen to act as Sam's guardian again, and before he left, Prime pressed upon him that the protection of the boy was his first priority. Alliance #4\n\nBumblebee's attempts to integrate himself into Sam's life were not as smooth as he had hoped. Without the team structure of the Autobots, Bumblebee tended to act upon instinct, taking revenge on Mikaela's ex-boyfriend Trent DeMarco for his previous humiliations of Sam by wrecking his truck, smashing a would-be car thief with the door he was attempting to unlock, and inadvertently giving Sam traffic tickets by not observing the rules of the road. When Bumblebee was alone, he attempted to learn as much as he could about human culture, feeling that he owed it to his friend. Soon, Sam came to the question of what Bumblebee would do when Sam went to college after the summer. 'Bee intended to follow Sam wherever he went, but Sam feared that he might not be able to bring his car along with him. Unfortunately, Sam's parents were less than thrilled with the idea of having an alien robot live with them while Sam was away, especially after what the Autobots had done to their beloved yard. Sam's father decreed that while Bumblebee could stay for the rest of the summer, once Sam has gone to school, the Autobot was out the door. However, unexpectedly, Ron Witwicky came to Bumblebee seeking aid when Mikaela reported that Sam had never made a rendezvous with her. Speeding out of the garage without Ron (and without waiting for the garage door to open), Bumblebee searched for clues to Sam's whereabouts and eventually found a message from his old foe Barricade, who demanded the AllSpark in exchange for the boy. Finding the pair at an car wrecking yard, Bumblebee attacked Barricade, but was considerably outmatched, with the Decepticon gloating that Earth had made the Autobot soft, and their last encounter was down to pure luck. Eventually, with a distraction from Sam, Bumblebee was able to force Barricade into a pool of gasoline. With the Decepticon hardly down for the count, Bumblebee told Sam to run and ignited the gasoline, causing a tremendous explosion that sent both Transformers flying. In the aftermath, Bumblebee told Sam he had a feeling they hadn't seen the last of Barricade. Tales of the Fallen #1\n\n\nBumblebee was guarding Sam Witwicky and did not take part in any NEST missions.The Veiled Threat\n\nHis voice gone again, Bumblebee communicated by playing snippets of Earth songs. \n\nBumblebee was driven by the Witwickys to Sam's college, where he quietly endured their bickering while scanning everything around him for potential threats. When he picked up radio transmissions from two new Autobots, he drove off into battle, and saved Skids and Mudflap from being slaughtered by the Decepticon Ransack. But with the villain threatening a long game, Bumblebee knew that here came trouble... Dogfight!\n\nSpeaking of trouble, poor Bumblebee ended up as the twins' minder. You can guess how well that went... Learning Curve\n\nSome time later, Bumblebee was hanging out in Sam's garage when he received an emergency call from Diego Garcia: the twins, now dangerous Decepticon turncoats, had abducted Sam! He tore out of the garage, tracked down the twins, and demanded they stop immediately. When they didn't, he launched suppressive fire and began ramming Skids, yelling \"let my people go-go!\". He soon had Sam free and the twins at gunpoint, ready to eliminate if necessary. However, partway into Mudflap's claims that they'd been framed and there was a bigger threat coming, Soundwave got the drop on Bumblebee and gunned him down... Outlaw Blues\n\nClearly he got better, because he was around for...\n\n\nBumblebee was dozing in the Witwicky garage the day Sam was packing for Princeton University when he heard the boy scream out his name. Bumblebee drove through, transformed and started blasting away at AllSpark Mutations of the Witwicky kitchen appliances. Judy Witwicky was horrified that Bumblebee blew up much of their house, but he shrugged her off and went back into the garage. As firefighters and local police arrived, Sam and Mikaela Banes went inside the garage. Mikaela asked whether Bumblebee was still having voice problems, to which Sam replied the Autobot was just playing it up. Sam revealed he did not want Bumblebee to come to college as he wanted a normal life, and he couldn't do that with Bumblebee watching over him. Bumblebee was heartbroken and began crying, refusing to listen anymore.\n\nHowever, Optimus Prime was having difficulties with NEST director Theodore Galloway, who believed protecting the human race required drawing away the Decepticons from Earth by making the Autobots leave. Optimus believed Sam would be a worthy ambassador to convince the President of the United States otherwise. Bumblebee picked up Sam from a frat party, only to get an unwanted passenger in Alice. Bumblebee knew something wasn't right about the girl interested in Sam, smashing her head against his dashboard, and dousing her in liquid to get rid of her. Bumblebee dropped Sam off to meet Optimus at a graveyard, where the boy turned down Optimus' offer.\n\nWhen Megatron returned from the dead, Bumblebee was deployed to rescue Sam, Mikaela and Leo Spitz, driving away with the latter two while Optimus drove off with Sam. Optimus died protecting the boy, and Bumblebee took him with Skids and Mudflap to an abandoned prison where they would be safe. Following Optimus' death, The Fallen and a new army of Decepticons struck out across Earth and announced their existence, promising to leave if they were given Witwicky. Galloway shut down NEST and had the other Autobots placed under guard with orders to ship them back to Diego Garcia, while a manhunt began for Sam. Bumblebee was now protecting a fugitive.\n\nThat evening, Sam told Bumblebee he was responsible for Optimus's death, and would understand if Bumblebee hated him, but the little Autobot bore Sam no grudge, and promised that he would help in any way he could. When Sam announced that he would turn himself in, Bumblebee insisted that it would not help matters. Under Leo's suggestion, the group came to New York City to meet his internet rival, the Robo-Warrior. As it turned out, the Robo-Warrior was none other than Bumblebee's former lubrication post, Seymour Simmons, who elaborated on evidence of the Seekers that came to Earth before Megatron and the AllSpark. Bumblebee watched from the sideline as the humans and Wheelie awoke Jetfire, who transported them to Egypt, which unfortunately sent Bumblebee crash landing near Sam. Jetfire explained the origins of the Seven Primes and the treasons of The Fallen, mentioning the Matrix of Leadership, which Sam believed could be used to resurrect Optimus Prime. \n\nBumblebee continued his role as chauffeur, transporting the humans to Petra, the supposed location of the Tomb of the Primes. However, Petra appeared to be a dead end, and the Twins got into an argument of why they were following Sam around, which, knowing the Twins, got violent. As their brawl threatened to crush the humans in the close quarters, Bumblebee picked his two subordinates up in each hand, slammed them together, and threw them out of the temple. However, the Twins' brawl had managed to unearth the Tomb of the Primes, and Bumblebee further opened the hole with his plasma cannon, where they found the Matrix...which instantly turned to dust. Oops. \n\nWhile heading back to Egypt, the Autobots came under assault by Starscream, and it was decided that Sam and Mikaela would take the Matrix dust to Prime's body while Bumblebee, Simmons, Leo, and the Twins would lead Starscream and the Decepticons away. When it became apparent that Starscream was no longer pursuing them, Bumblebee left to rejoin Sam. Heading to the abandoned town where Sam and Mikaela were, Bumblebee found that Ron and Judy Witwicky had been captured by the Decepticons, and were being held by Rampage. Noticing Bumblebee, Sam distracted the Constructicon long enough for Bumblebee to jump him. While Bumblebee had Rampage on the ropes, Ravage jumped Bumblebee, but the plucky Autobot managed to fight off Ravage and rip out his spine. Ouch. With Ravage dispatched, Bumblebee managed to tear off Rampage's arms and distend his head. Bumblebee then tried to escort his charges to NEST's position, but the heavy amount of fire convinced Sam to have Bumblebee to take his parents to safety, while he continued his quest to save Optimus. \n\nHowever, during Sam's flight to Optimus's body, Megatron caught up and blasted the boy, evidently killing him. Bumblebee returned to the scene with Sam's parents, and broke down in grief. However, the human miraculously survived the attack, and with the reformed Matrix of Leadership, resurrected Optimus Prime. Together, the assembled Autobots and humans watched as Optimus combined with the remains of Jetfire, destroyed the harvester and killed The Fallen. Revenge of the Fallen\n\n\nAfter the discovery of new Decepticons on Earth, Bumblebee decided to upgrade his arsenal and modified his vehicle mode so he could use weaponry in it, deciding he'd been caught off guard too many times before. Cannon Bumblebee\n\nFollowing this, he volunteered to be Sam's guardian, It was a pretty swank deal: he got to hang with Sam and Mikaela all the time, got lots of oil, and could join Ironhide in killing Decepticons whenever he wanted. Bumblebee But when the battle shifted to the deserts, he threw himself into the fray, upgrading himself for desert combat and wielding the mighty sand blast! Sand Attack Bumblebee\n\nPost-Fallen, he was sent back into the field. His first new mission was to capture Reverb. When Jolt messed the mission up, Bumblebee saved the day by ramming the bike head-on. Culture Shock\n\nLater, with Lennox and his crew searching for Seekers, Bumblebee was left with only Robert Epps to investigate an attack on Malmstrom Air Force Base and the disappearance of Optimus Prime. Epps worked out that Optimus had been victim of an electromagnetic bomb, and Bumblebee tracked his leader to where he was being held. (Poor Epps had to ride in Bumblebee jumping a ravine, and almost spewed up his breakfast) After locating Prime, they found he was a captive of the Free Men militia. At Epps command, Bumblebee hit the Free Men compound with his full firepower, swiftly defeating the militia.   Bring Me the Head of Optimus Prime\n\nHe dispatched three raw cadets (Jolt, Rollbar, and Dune Runner) to Death Valley for a survival exercise. Spare Parts! Later, he was summoned as back-up by NEST South Africa due to a Decepticon jailbreak, but Optimus ordered him to let the Decepticons leave to prevent civilian casualties. Inside Out!\n\nWith the Autobot's reputation in the toilet because of the South Africa failure, and with concerns that public fights risked alienating humans, Bumblebee was tasked to head a covert unit with Slap Dash and Hubcap. They'd operate under NEST's radar, monitoring Decepticons and waiting for windows of opportunity out of the public eye, before hitting hard and fast. In practice, this meant allowing Decepticons like Crankstart, Brimstone, and Trenchmouth to run amok in cities, with Bumblebee restraining his desire to stop them and keeping his men from taking action. After an uncomfortable period of hoping nobody would be killed, the Decepticons went to an isolated stretch of road: now free to act, Bumblebee led his men in a vicious ambush and personally drove through Crankshaft. Shadow War\n\n\n\nBumblebee and Ironhide were reviewing some data tracks that Optimus Prime had made for preservation in Vector Sigma when they detected an explosion outside their base. Bumblebee remained to lock down the most important data tracks while Ironhide went to investigate the cause of the explosion. However, that is what the Decepticons wanted, as moments later, Soundwave burst into the base, overwhelming Bumblebee with a sonic attack, and mocking Bumblebee for being the smallest Autobot. Bumblebee countered that he wasn't as small as Soundwave thought, but in the battle that followed, Soundwave was able to physically overpower Bumblebee. Bumblebee fired a shot from his shoulder cannon, but Soundwave absorbed the sonic boom and sent the acoustic energy back at him. Bumblebee decided to use a more ingenious method: fire automatic weaponry at Soundwave, giving too many sonic booms for Soundwave to absorb, defeating the Decepticon. Bumblebee then tried to inform Ironhide of what had happened, but he had unfinished business with Bludgeon.Cyber Missions 1 Following this, Bumblebee placed Soundwave in an electromagnetically sealed bubble, leaving him  unable to absorb any sonic booms to escape. Cyber Missions 2\n\nAfter Ironhide went missing in the jungle, Bumblebee reported the problem to Optimus, who was luckily in the area.  Prime asked him to conduct a scan of the area in which Ironhide went missing, and Bumblebee discovered that the rocks in the area had an unusually high concentration of energon deposits. Cyber Missions 5 Bumblebee took part in a training exercise with Ironhide in the Arctic when his comrade decided that the smaller 'bot was too often a target for the Decepticons. During their sparring, they discovered what appeared to be a sentient plant growing in the snow. Cyber Missions 8\n\nBumblebee and Ratchet were dispatched to a building in Scramble City by Optimus, who briefed them that Smolder and Chopster were causing trouble. On reaching the building, they encountered Chopster, who screamed and ran away when Bumblebee looked menacing. Bumblebee called after him to bring his friend out, replying to a bemused Ratchet that not every encounter had to be a battle. The pair were almost run down a short time later by Smolder, and Bumblebee was forced to grapple at length with the Decepticon while Ratchet worked on repowering his EMP blaster. Afterward, the two Autobots stood over the disabled Decepticon and cracked jokes. Cyber Missions 9\n\nOptimus reported finding Megatron and Starscream in the Arctic regions of Earth, and Bumblebee was summoned to aid his leader in battle with Ironhide, Ratchet and Sideswipe. Starscream broke off from the two on one duel, and attacked all the Autobots at once, only to be defeated in due time. However, Optimus let Megatron go, and Starscream apparently followed suit. Cyber Missions 12\n\nOptimus later laid a trap to lure the Decepticons to a final confrontation with a hologram of Soundwave, and Megatron indeed walked right into it. Bumblebee, Ironhide, and Ratchet arrived to join the battle, and in the ensuing fight, Bumblebee took on Mindwipe. The Decepticon tried to hypnotize Bumblebee into not fighting, but he nonchalantly ingnored him, and continued fighting. An army of humans arrived and surrounded the combatants, and the day went to the Autobots. Optimus once again let Megatron and the Decepticons go at their choice. After Megatron fled, Bumblebee decided to give the Decepticons a reminder of who protected this planet, and stamped out an Autobot symbol in the dirt. Decepticons Attack\n\nBumblebee was at Edwards Air Force Base with Ratchet when they received word that two Cybertronians in transition forms had landed near Hurley's Crossing. The pair went there by helicopter and encountered Reverb, who claimed to be a Decepticon defector hunting down another Decepticon who was after the technology at Hawthorne Army Depot. Though Bumblebee was highly skeptical, he followed Ratchet's lead, and they took Reverb to the depot. When they reached it, Kevin Bowman let them know that Gears was an Autobot and in reality trying to protect an ancient weapons cache. The warning came too late, as Reverb turned the weapons on Bumblebee and Ratchet, who were unable to penetrate the personal forcefield Reverb had acquired. Despite this, Bumblebee lasted out Reverb's defeat with minimal damage. Switching Gears\n\nWhen Bumblebee and Gears were left at base, they received word from Douglas Porter that the Decepticon Blowback was heading up to Battle Mountain where a storehouse of Cybertronian artifacts had been discovered. The pair were compelled to travel to Battle Mountain with Kevin and Douglas, though Bumblebee made a detour to a Kwiki-Burger on the way. On arrival, they were attacked by Blowback and his men, and by the time they'd dispatched the four Decepticons, Kevin and Douglas had found the storehouse. They were subsequently picked up by Ironhide and taken back to face Optimus Prime's anger at them having gone off on their own. Battle Mountain\n\nWhen the Battle Mountain cylinder was in danger of activating, Bumblebee and Gears took part in a convoy to transport the device to a NEST vault near Yucca Mountain. The trip was cut short when the convoy was ambushed outside Beatty by Reverb and some stolen Hyperdynamix autonomous tanks. They caught a break when Reverb was called away to the nearby Hyperdynamix Aerospace facility, and while Gears and Kevin followed the Decepticon, Bumblebee remained to protect the remains of the convoy. Satellite of Doom\n\nBumblebee was in charge of a team made up of Jolt, Knock Out, Dune Runner and Breakaway. When NEST's satellite images detected Decepticon activity in Florida, Bumblebee's team was sent to investigate. Though Bumblebee instructed Breakaway not to engage the enemy, Breakaway attacked Soundwave and was destroyed. Bumblebee and the rest of his team engaged the Decepticons at Kingdom Petrochemicals, but after a group of humans left and the Decepticons fled, Bumblebee was left mystified as to what was going on. Nefarious #1 He and his team returned to Edwards Air Force Base, where Galloway was annoyed that he hadn't been notified about the arrival on Earth of some of the members of Bumblebee's team. Nefarious #2\n\nAfter Optimus managed to capture Soundwave in Utah, Bumblebee's team guarded the Decepticon. They loaded him onto a plane for transport to a NEST base in Texas, however en route the plane was shot down by Buzzsaw. Resolving to deliver Soundwave, Bumblebee took his team on the road. It wasn't long before they ran into Soundwave's \"mini-militia\". Bumblebee quickly realized that his team was outmatched. Rather than a repeat of the loss of Breakaway, Bumblebee opted to release Soundwave. Nefarious #3\n\nSoundwave eventually located the Initiative base and led the Autobots to Inyokern... only to find the base was gone. He traced it to Crater Lake, and the Autobots went on a road trip up to Oregon. Bumblebee's team was sent to assault the base from the north, however as he broke through the base's outer wall, he was confronted by an Initiative-controlled Transformer. Nefarious #5 Bumblebee was taken down, and his team required reinforcements to break through the resistance to help him. Presumably his damage wasn't spark-threatening, as he was seen safe and well in the aftermath of the battle. Nefarious #6\n\n\nBumblebee charged to Sam's defense when Starscream tried to abduct the boy, but proved no match for the Decepticon, and was flung around the yard. As Starscream started making off with Sam, Bumblebee made another attempt to stop him, and was brushed aside. Luckily Optimus arrived to help, and Starscream soon fled, but the Witwicky's yard was in ruins. Sam in Danger\n\nThis character article is a stub and is missing information on their fictional appearances. You can help Transformers Wiki by expanding it.\n\nTransformers: RatchetTransformers: Bumblebee\n\nBrains was in a parking lot in Philadelphia, trying to find some help, so he tried asking a car for help. When no response came, Brains kicked the car, angrily, but was shocked when it transformed into Bumblebee. Rising Storm #1 Sam and Bumblebee brought Brains back to his college.  Suddenly, the college was under attack from Starscream and other Decepticons. Sonar attempted to attack Bumblebee, but was promptly killed by the newly arrived Mirage and Wheeljack. Rising Storm #2 Barricade reappeared and placed Bumblebee in a headlock, who retaliated by punching Barricade in the jaw when the Decepticon attempted to attack Sam. Rising Storm #3 Bumblebee slammed Barricade into a sidewalk, defeating him. Afterwards, Bumblebee bade goodbye to Sam and Carly Spencer as NEST decided they required him on the field rather than to guard Sam. Rising Storm #4\n\n\nThree years after Operation Firestorm, Bumblebee continued to live with Sam and Carly Spencer in Washington, D.C., although he would frequently go on top secret NEST missions with the rest of the Autobots, mostly to prevent human conflict. He was among a force consisting of himself, Sideswipe, Dino and Que which was to investigate an illegal nuclear facility, employing his Stealth Force mode to destroy it. Meanwhile a mission to the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant revealed an engine part to a Cybertronian fuel cell belonging to the long lost Ark. Upon returning to the NEST base, Bumblebee assisted in teaching soldiers how to fight Decpticons, and watched as National Intelligence Director Charlotte Mearing informed them that the Ark was on the moon.\n\nAfter Sam's encounter with Laserbeak, he went looking for Bumblebee with the information given to him by Jerry Wang, about a conspiracy of humans collaborating with the Decepticons. However the guards outside weren't willing to let him in, and after hearing Sam calling for help on a radio Bumblebee went to warn the guards off. Sam told Bumblebee that he wasn't happy that Bumblebee wasn't visiting him very often now, and Wheelie accused him of thinking he was too good for them. Bumblebee witnessed the reactivation of Sentinel Prime, and then went home with Sam, who's offer of help was denied by Mearing. However Sam wasn't ready to let go of the situation, and Bumblebee helped in trying to figure out why Decepticons were killing humans, and took the time to allow Bruce Brazos to get up close and personal.\n\nAfter Sam, Simmons and Dutch learned that the Decepticons had tricked the Autobots into retrieving and reviving Sentinel so that they could use him to work the Space Bridge pillars, Bumblebee, Sideswipe and Dino escorted the humans and Sentinel back to the NEST base. Along the way they were attacked by the Dreads, and Bumblebee and Sideswipe used their Stealth Force modes to shoot at Hatchet while Dino held him in place. But when Crankcase knocked a truck into his path, Bumblebee had to transform over the crash, tossing Sam out and then returning to vehicle mode after grabbing Sam. But upon arriving back at NEST, Sentinel revealed he had made a deal with Megatron to restore Cybertron, and Bumblebee was unable to prevent Ironhide from being killed and the base from being destroyed as Sentinel retrieved his pillars. \n\nBumblebee was among the team tracking Sentinel, but was too late to prevent him from transporting a Decepticon army from the moon to Earth, and as they were horribly outnumbered, Optimus ordered a retreat. When Sentinel forced the humans to exile the Autobots on their ship, the Xantium, Bumblebee was allowed by Optimus a short time to say goodbye to Sam, and assured him he was always going to be his friend, before helping the others prepare the ship for launch. However shortly after lift-off, the Xantium was destroyed by Starscream, and Bumblebee and the rest of the Autobots were presumed dead. \n\nHowever, they had hidden in a rocket booster that was jettisoned before the Xantium's destruction, and arrived in the Decepticon-occupied Chicago in time to help Sam, Epps and a team of soldiers in finding the kidnapped Carly. Bumblebee piloted one of the downed Decepticon fighters to get Sam into the building Dylan Gould had Carly, and used it to rescue the pair and blasted off Laserbeak's head. He rejoined his fellow Autobots in attacking the Decepticon forces, and arrived in time to save Sam and Lennox from falling to their deaths after Sam managed to kill Starscream. \n\nHowever after rejoining the others, Bumblebee, Sideswipe, Dino, Ratchet and Que were rounded up and captured by Soundwave and his troops. Dylan convinced Soundwave not to take prisoners, and Barricade and another Decepticon killed Que, and Bumblebee was upset over the loss of his friend. He had barely a moment to mourn as he was pulled forward and about to be killed by Soundwave himself.  He then caught sight of Sam and Carly sadly watching the scene and gave a heartfelt last look at his friend as he prepared for the end, noting they \"had a hell of a run\". It was then that Wheelie and Brains caused chaos by dropping Decepticon fighters from a Decepticon warship above, distracting Soundwave. Taking advantage, Bumblebee took Soundwave on, and following a tumultuous battle, killed the Decepticon by throwing an uppercut through his chest and firing his arm cannon upwards, disintegrating his head. \n\nFollowing this, Bumblebee battled his way to the Control Pillar with his fellow Autobots, and helped Optimus in fighting Sentinel. With Ratchet's help, he tackled and destroyed the pillar, stopping Cybertron from appearing in Earth's orbit. After the defeat of the Decepticons and Sentinel Prime, Bumblebee took out some rings inside him as he gave them to Sam, so Sam could propose to Carly, though Sam told him that he needed to slow it down. Ratchet commended Bumblebee for his bravery during the battle, and accepted Earth as his new home with Cybertron now destroyed.  Dark of the Moon\n\n\nBumblebee had never ridden a Dinobot before, and decided to start by trying to mount Strafe. Guided by a kind but astonishingly unhelpful narrator, Bumblebee's attempts to mount Strafe left something to be desired. After many failed efforts, Bumblebee simply destroyed the instruction manual to riding Dinobots before storming off in annoyance, much to the narrator's surprise.\nGetting on a Dinobot\n\n\n\nBumblebee, along with Optimus Prime and Crosshairs, tracked three Decepticon survivors of Chicago to Jakarta, Indonesia. When the Decepticons retreated and Crosshairs tracked them to Pulau Bidadari, Bumblebee monitored the ranger and relayed the events to Optimus. Thousand Island Flight\n\nSome time in the past Bumblebee had a phase when he was increasingly insubordinate.\n\nAfter Optimus Prime disappeared, Bumblebee took command of the remaining Autobot refugees on Earth as they hid from Cemetery Wind despite the others viewing him as brash and inexperienced. When Optimus returned to the Autobots Bumblebee once more gave up command- but this did not stop Drift from complaining about the leadership skills of the Yellow 'Bot. He didn't take to well to being called a child and a fight between the two soon broke out. Drift managed to pin Bee with his swords and claimed that his \"puppy dog eyes act\" was beneath him. The mood was soon sobered when Cade Yeager revealed footage of Ratchet being attacked as well as Leadfoots death.\n\nBumblebee later served as a disguise for Cade and Shane Dyson when the two infiltrated the KSI headquarters in Chicago. Upon seeing the company's display of Stinger, a Drone based on him, as well several videos and posters claiming that he was inferior to the human-made Transformer, Bumblebee flipped out. He managed to avoid discovery and had to sneak out of the building along with Shane to prevent Cade from being caught by Joshua Joyce. However, as soon as Optimus saw that KSI were melting down Ratchet's head, Bumblebee joined in the Autobot attack of the building and scanned a new alternate mode for good measure. He got a lift from Drifts helicopter mode to the buildings upper levels and was able to rescue Cade from Harold Attinger. \n\nAfter the Autobots retreated from KSI, Bumblebee attempted to fend off Galvatron and Stinger but was left in utter shock when Galvatron merely disintegrated and reassembled himself after being hit by Bumblebee's missiles.\n\nBumblebee helped infiltrate Lockdown's ship when Prime was captured and later helped the humans escape from several Steeljaws but could not stop the ships anchors from being detached, causing the humans to fall towards Chicago. They were saved, however, when Bumblebee swung down on the cables and grabbed the falling humans, though he couldn't stop from slamming into the side of a building. They were then given a lift by Crosshairs in a gunship, but were then pursued by Lockdown's Henchmen and Crosshairs was forced to pass over control to Bumblebee so he could shoot down the pursuers. Though Bumblebee managed to lose their pursuers in a tunnel, he wound up crashing the gunship through the street. \n\nBumblebee and the humans met up with the rest of the Autobots at a disused train yard where Brains informed them that Megatron had been tricking KSI into building him a new body and was planning to detonate the seed in the Earths \"biggest city\" to announce his return and to build a new army of Decepticons. Optimus then declared that the Autobots would only retrieve the Seed before leaving Earth for good and the group set off to China to stop Galvatron.\n\nWhen the Autobot ship reached Hong Kong it was shot down by one of Galvatron's Traxes, Bumblebee, Hound and the humans fell out and had to escort the seed out of the city. Bumblebee and Hound provided a defensive line against Galvatron's forces and though they destroyed many drones, they were slowly being overwhelmed.  They were only saved when Optimus returned with reinforcements. Bumblebee was confronting Stinger when Strafe flew down and picked him up. Stinger, however, grabbed onto Bumblebee and a battle between the lookalikes raged on the Flying Dinobot. Stinger caused Strafe to fall onto the Hong Kong streets before Bumblebee eliminated him and claimed that he hated \"Cheap Knockoffs\"-a reference to Stinger being based off of him, and let Strafe gnaw on the drones broken head. \n\nBumblebee was later tasked by Cade to take Tessa Yeager and Shane out of the city until he was convinced to turn back and help Optimus and Cade fight Lockdown. Despite Optimus ordering him to leave, he assisted Cade in fighting Lockdown.  Bumblebee fought well but was eventually dispatched by Lockdown, who was soon killed by Optimus.  Bumblebee, alongside the other Autobots, was tasked with protecting the Yeager family from Galvatron and his Minions when Optimus left earth to search for the creators.  Age of Extinction\n\n\n\nIn the online virtual world simulation/game Second Life, there was a full replica of the Sector Seven base which contained a giant discussion room where Michael Bay held a question board. This room contained a giant frozen Megatron replica and free avatars of both Bumblebee and Barricade. Both freebies were non-transforming. Also, the Bumblebee avatar had his battle mask down and it could not be raised.\n\nBumblebee sported several different license plates between the movies, the video games and the toys:\n"], ["Bumblebee - Ubuntu Wiki", "https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee", "  Contents\nBumblebee Project\nInstallation\nBasic Setup for 12.04 - 13.04\nBasic Setup for 13.10 and later\nAdvanced Setups\nUsage\nPower Management\nTroubleshooting\n\"Cannot access secondary GPU\" error\nUpdating drivers\nExample update to nvidia-319 driver\nIRC\nReporting bugs/problems\nUninstall\nSocial Media\nCUDA\n\n\nBumblebee Project\nBumblebee aims to provide support for NVIDIA Optimus laptops for GNU/Linux distributions.

Five of these species (western bumble bee, rusty patched bumble bee, yellowbanded bumble bee\u00a0and the American bumble bee) were once very common and important crop pollinators over their ranges. Franklin\u2019s bumble bee was historically found only in a small area in southern Oregon and northern California, and it may now be extinct. We\u2019ve recently launched a collaborative citizen science project called Bumble Bee Watch to track these and all other North American bumble bees.\nRecent research indicates that additional species of bumble bees may be in decline. Wild bumble bees face many threats including habitat alteration, pesticide use, management practices, and pathogens. Recent reports are troubling, but there is much you can do to help!\nTo read more about recent declines see the Threats section below.\nThis project was funded by the Oregon Zoo.\n\nDownload our new publication: \u00a0Conserving Bumble Bees. Guidelines for Creating and Managing Habitat for America\u2019s Declining Pollinators.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Xerces Society has collaborated with the\u00a0Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center\u00a0to create a list of plants that are attractive to bumble bees,\u00a0please consider using this valuable\u00a0resource.\nWe are very interested in tracking all species of North American bumble bees at our new citizen science website Bumble Bee Watch!\nBelow is a map of the citizen records. Citizen science has greatly helped us to understand the distribution and nesting habits of these important yet imperiled pollinators and will help us to target our conservation efforts.\n\nWe are collecting data on bumble bee nesting habits. \u00a0Please visit www.bumblebeewatch.org to submit a nest sighting.\n\nThere are a number of threats facing bumble bees, any of which may be leading to the decline of these species. The major threats to bumble bees include: spread of pests and diseases through commercial bumble bee rearing or other methods, habitat destruction or alteration, pesticides, invasive species, low genetic diversity and climate change.\nCommercial bumble bee rearing may be the greatest threat to B. affinis, B. occidentalis, B. terricola, and B. franklini. In North America, two bumble bee species have been commercially reared for pollination of greenhouse tomatoes and other crops: B. occidentalis and B. impatiens. Between 1992 and 1994, queens of B. occidentalis and B. impatiens were shipped to European rearing facilities, where colonies were produced then shipped back to the U.S. for commercial pollination. Bumble bee expert Robbin Thorp has hypothesized that these bumble bee colonies acquired a disease (probably a virulent strain of the microsporidian Nosema bombi) from a European bee that was in the same rearing facility, the buff-tailed bumble bee (Bombus terrestris). The North American bumble bees would have had no prior resistance to this pathogen. Dr. Thorp hypothesizes that the disease then spread to wild populations of B. occidentalis and B. franklini in the West (from exposure to infected populations of commercially reared B. occidentalis), and B. affinis and B. terricola in the East (from exposure to commercially reared B. impatiens). In the late 1990\u2032s, biologists began to notice that B. affinis, B. occidentalis, B. terricola, and B. franklini were severely declining.\nWhere these bees were once very common, they were nearly impossible to find. B. impatiens has not shown a dramatic decline; Robbin Thorp hypothesizes that B. impatiens may serve as a carrier of an exotic strain of Nosema bombi, although it may not be as severly affected by the disease as B. affinis, B. occidentalis, B. terricola, and B. franklini. B. affinis, B. occidentalis, B. terricola, and B. franklini are closely related to each other (they all belong to the subgenus Bombus sensu stricto).\nThis hypothesis was supported by a recent study led by Sydney Cameron, Ph.D., published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. They found that the western bumble bee and the American bumble bee had significantly higher infection rates from a fungal parasite than more stable species. \u00a0They also found that these two species had lower genetic diversity than species that were not in decline. \u00a0Research is currently underway in Dr. Cameron\u2019s lab to determine whether or not this fungal parasite was introduced from Europe via the commercial bumble bee trade. You can read more about their study and its implications\u00a0here.\u00a0The Xerces Society is currently working to urge the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service to regulate the commercial bumble bee trade. You can read a\u00a0status review\u00a0that includes more details on this issue and the decline of three bumble bees that was\u00a0written by Dr. Robbin Thorp and The Xerces Society.\nAll bumble bees belong to the genus Bombus within the family Apidae. The family Apidae includes the well-known honey bees and bumble bees, as well as carpenter bees, cuckoo bees, digger bees, stingless bees, and orchid bees. B. affinis, B. terricola, B. occidentalis, and B. franklini all belong to the same sub-genus of Bombus, Bombus sensu stricto.\nBumble bees are important pollinators of wild flowering plants and crops. As generalist foragers, they do not depend on any one flower type. However, some plants do rely on bumble bees to achieve pollination. Loss of bumble bees can have far ranging ecological impacts due to their role as pollinators. In Britain and the Netherlands, where multiple bumble bee and other bee species have gone extinct, there is evidence of decline in the abundances of insect pollinated plants. Bumble bees are also excellent pollinators of many crops. Bumble bees are able to fly in cooler temperatures and lower light levels than many other bees, and they perform a behavior called \u201cbuzz pollination,\u201d in which the bee grabs the pollen producing structure of the flower in her jaws and vibrates her wing musculature causing vibrations that dislodge pollen that would have otherwise remained trapped in the flower\u2019s anthers. Some plants, including tomatoes, peppers, and cranberries, require buzz pollination. Read more.\nOn February 10, 2010, a broad coalition of scientists submitted a letter to the USDA\u2019s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) requesting that they create new regulations to protect wild bumble bees from threats posed by commercial bumble bees. The letter was signed by over 60 scientists with research on bumble bees and other bees, including: Charles D. Michener, Ph.D., author of The Bees of the World; Bernd Heinrich, Ph.D., author of Bumblebee Economics; David Goulson, Ph.D., author of Bumblebees: Their Behaviour, Ecology and Conservation, James Thomson, Ph.D., co-author of The Natural History of Bumble Bees; and May Berenbaum, Ph.D., Chair of the National Research Council Committee on the Status of Pollinators in North America. Letters of support were also submitted by native plant societies, sustainable agriculture organizations and conservation organizations.\nOn January 12, 2010, The Xerces Society, Defenders of Wildlife, Natural Resources Defense Council and Dr. Robbin Thorp submitted a petition to the USDA\u2019s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) requesting that they create new regulations to protect wild bumble bees from disease. In order to prevent the spread of disease to wild populations of agriculturally significant bee pollinators, petitioners asked APHIS to use its authority to regulate the movement and health of commercial bumble bees. Specifically, petitioners requested that APHIS create rules prohibiting the movement of bumble bees outside of their native ranges and regulate interstate movement of bumble bee pollinators within their native ranges by requiring permits that show that bumble bees are certified as disease-free prior to movement.

Using Bumblebee, you can use your NVIDIA card for rendering graphics which will be displayed using the Intel card. The instructions on this page applies to Debian Wheezy and newer. Debian Squeeze and prior are not supported. For Sid and Jessie users, Bumblebee packages are available directly from the Debian repositories, head down to the Installation section. In summary, it's as simple as installing bumblebee or bumblebee-nvidia, and primus. For Wheezy users, Bumblebee packages are available from wheezy-backports. Follow the steps listed on that page to add backports to your sources.list (but make sure that you also add wheezy-backports' contrib repository as well to your sources.list, e.g. deb\u00a0http://YOURMIRROR.debian.org/debian\u00a0wheezy-backports\u00a0main\u00a0contrib\u00a0non-free), and then install bumblebee or bumblebee-nvidia, and primus. Refer to the Installation section below. \nInstallation\n\nFrom repository\nSid and Jessie users can install everything directly from the official repositories. For users who would like to use the free nouveau driver: sudo\u00a0apt-get\u00a0install\u00a0bumblebee\u00a0primus For users who would like to use the proprietary nvidia driver (again, requires contrib and non-free enabled in your sources.list): sudo\u00a0apt-get\u00a0install\u00a0bumblebee-nvidia\u00a0primus Users running a 64-bit system who want to take advantage of Bumblebee with the primus backend when running 32-bit applications will also want to install primus-libs:i386. This requires Multiarch support. sudo\u00a0dpkg\u00a0--add-architecture\u00a0i386\u00a0&&\u00a0sudo\u00a0apt-get\u00a0update\u00a0&&\u00a0sudo\u00a0apt-get\u00a0install\u00a0bumblebee-nvidia\u00a0primus\u00a0primus-libs:i386 Wheezy users can install everything directly from backports. sudo\u00a0apt-get\u00a0install\u00a0-t\u00a0wheezy-backports\u00a0bumblebee\u00a0primus -or- sudo\u00a0apt-get\u00a0install\u00a0-t\u00a0wheezy-backports\u00a0bumblebee-nvidia\u00a0primus -or- sudo\u00a0dpkg\u00a0--add-architecture\u00a0i386\u00a0&&\u00a0sudo\u00a0apt-get\u00a0update\u00a0&&\u00a0sudo\u00a0apt-get\u00a0install\u00a0-t\u00a0wheezy-backports\u00a0bumblebee-nvidia\u00a0primus\u00a0primus-libs:i386 Note wheezy-backports does not contain the newer xserver-xorg-video-intel package that is needed by newer intel cards. If you find yourself stuck with the fbdev or vesa driver then you'll need to upgrade to jessie or sid. Warning: If you choose to install bumblebee-nvidia and the dependent nvidia driver packages, during postinst, you will see a debconf prompt warning you that you need to create a xorg.conf file in order to use the proprietary nvidia driver. This prompt only applies to non-Optimus users, i.e. single Nvidia GPU systems. Do NOT allow debconf to create a xorg.conf file, and do NOT run nvidia-xconfig! (This prompt always appears when you install nvidia packages through the repositories, and it currently does not detect Optimus/bumblebee users. See 735049 for a brief explanation.) Alternatively, Wheezy, Jessie, and Sid users can install everything from an external repository (which was setup before bumblebee packages were made available in the official repositories). Check http://suwako.nomanga.net/ for details. \nCompiling from source\nRefer to Bumblebee/ManualInstall. These instructions are provided for historical reference only and are not recommended now that packages are available through the repositories. \nPost-installation\nYou must add your user to the bumblebee group in order to use optirun, i.e. sudo\u00a0adduser\u00a0$USER\u00a0bumblebee where $USER corresponds to your username. Don't forget to log out and log back in for this to take effect. If you have sudo configured for your current user, i.e. your user is a member of the sudo group, this step is not needed (the bumblebee package postinst script takes care of adding sudo users to the bumblebee group automatically). This is likely to be the reason why Bumblebee works out of the box in Ubuntu, but not in Debian, with the same initial setup, i.e. Ubuntu has sudo installed by default; Debian does not. To clarify, sudo is not needed to use bumblebee; it simply makes adding your user to the bumblebee group unnecessary. \nUsage\nTo run your application with the discrete NVIDIA card run in the terminal: $ optirun\u00a0[options]\u00a0<application>\u00a0[application-parameters] Example: $ optirun\u00a0glxgears\u00a0-info For a list of options for optirun open the manpage with man\u00a0optirun or run: $ optirun\u00a0--help \nPower Management\nA primary goal of this project is to not only enable use of the discrete GPU for rendering, but also to enable smart power management of the dGPU when it's not in use. We're using either bbswitch (a module) or vga_switcheroo (kernel module, experimental) to do this in Bumblebee. bbswitch is packaged in Debian and is automatically installed when choosing to install bumblebee through the repositories. Since Bumblebee 3.0, this feature is enabled by default, using bbswitch. This allow automatic power management, without any configuration needs. If Power Management doesn't work on your laptop, please go to this Power Management (PM) page and help to improve Bumblebee. \nIRC\nIf you have any questions, feel free to join #bumblebee on Freenode. \nReporting bugs/problems\nFirst of all: If you have any problem, please read the article Troubleshooting. If your issue is not solved, you can join the #bumblebee IRC channel to ask for help (recommended).

Refer to the comments in that file for further instructions. - If optirun errors out and dmesg reports that your GPU has \"fallen off the bus\" on Linux >= 3.10, either stick with an older kernel version (<= 3.9), or add rcutree.rcu_idle_gp_delay=1 to your grub command line (in /etc/default/grub, then run update-grub and reboot) as a workaround. This is a known problem upstream and suspected to be an issue with the proprietary nvidia driver.

For users who would like to use the free nouveau driver: sudo\u00a0apt-get\u00a0install\u00a0bumblebee\u00a0primus For users who would like to use the proprietary nvidia driver (again, requires contrib and non-free enabled in your sources.list): sudo\u00a0apt-get\u00a0install\u00a0bumblebee-nvidia\u00a0primus Users running a 64-bit system who want to take advantage of Bumblebee with the primus backend when running 32-bit applications will also want to install primus-libs:i386.

If you find yourself stuck with the fbdev or vesa driver then you'll need to upgrade to jessie or sid. Warning: If you choose to install bumblebee-nvidia and the dependent nvidia driver packages, during postinst, you will see a debconf prompt warning you that you need to create a xorg.conf file in order to use the proprietary nvidia driver. This prompt only applies to non-Optimus users, i.e. single Nvidia GPU systems. Do NOT allow debconf to create a xorg.conf file, and do NOT run nvidia-xconfig! (This prompt always appears when you install nvidia packages through the repositories, and it currently does not detect Optimus/bumblebee users. See 735049 for a brief explanation.) Alternatively, Wheezy, Jessie, and Sid users can install everything from an external repository (which was setup before bumblebee packages were made available in the official repositories). Check http://suwako.nomanga.net/ for details. \nCompiling from source\nRefer to Bumblebee/ManualInstall. These instructions are provided for historical reference only and are not recommended now that packages are available through the repositories. \nPost-installation\nYou must add your user to the bumblebee group in order to use optirun, i.e. sudo\u00a0adduser\u00a0$USER\u00a0bumblebee where $USER corresponds to your username.

If you have sudo configured for your current user, i.e. your user is a member of the sudo group, this step is not needed (the bumblebee package postinst script takes care of adding sudo users to the bumblebee group automatically). This is likely to be the reason why Bumblebee works out of the box in Ubuntu, but not in Debian, with the same initial setup, i.e. Ubuntu has sudo installed by default; Debian does not.

If you find yourself stuck with the fbdev or vesa driver then you'll need to upgrade to jessie or sid. Warning: If you choose to install bumblebee-nvidia and the dependent nvidia driver packages, during postinst, you will see a debconf prompt warning you that you need to create a xorg.conf file in order to use the proprietary nvidia driver. This prompt only applies to non-Optimus users, i.e. single Nvidia GPU systems. Do NOT allow debconf to create a xorg.conf file, and do NOT run nvidia-xconfig! (This prompt always appears when you install nvidia packages through the repositories, and it currently does not detect Optimus/bumblebee users. See 735049 for a brief explanation.) Alternatively, Wheezy, Jessie, and Sid users can install everything from an external repository (which was setup before bumblebee packages were made available in the official repositories).

We're using either bbswitch (a module) or vga_switcheroo (kernel module, experimental) to do this in Bumblebee. bbswitch is packaged in Debian and is automatically installed when choosing to install bumblebee through the repositories.

Such feature involves two graphics cards with two different power consumption profiles plugged in a layered way sharing a single framebuffer.\n\nYou also need to install VirtualGL. Download the latest version for your arch at the VirtualGL download page or use yum command \n\nIf you want to run 32 bit apps on your 64 bit system, then also install:\n\nInstall the Bumblebee yum repository\n\nThe previous commands install bumbleblee with the nouveau drivers. If you want to install bumblebee with the NVIDIA proprietary drivers you must also follow these instructions:\n\nInstall the bumblebee-nonfree repository:\n\nA potentially more up-to-date driver may be installed using the bumblebee-nonfree-shortlived repo:\n\nA potentially more up-to-date driver may be installed using the bumblebee-nonfree-shortlived repo:\n\nMake sure you have glibc-devel installed because it is needed for bumblebee-nvidia to compile the driver\n\nNow install bumblebee-nvidia\n\n\"bumblebee-nvidia\" is both a rpm package and a shell script. The \"bumblebee-nvidia\" package contains the shell \"wrapper\" script, init scripts to run it at bootup, and a SELinux security policy, and lastly a copy of the NVidia Linux binary driver \"blob\" downloaded from NVidia's UNIX drivers page. This is why the packages are so large compared to the bumblebee package.\n\nReboot.\n\nTo verify you are now using the NVIDIA driver, run the glxgears demo (from mesa-demos):\n\nYou should see some gears rotating.  In the terminal you should see \"GL_VENDOR = NVIDIA Corporation\" or something similar.\n\nFor speed imrovements you can use primus. Primus is a shared library that provides OpenGL and GLX APIs and implements low-overhead local-only client-side OpenGL offloading via GLX forking, similar to VirtualGL. It intercepts GLX calls and redirects GL rendering to a secondary X display, presumably driven by a faster GPU. On swapping buffers, rendered contents are read back using a PBO and copied onto the drawable it was supposed to be rendered on in the first place. Currently primus requires the NVIDIA proprietary drivers.\n\nInstall primus:\n\nIf you want to run 32 bit apps on your 64 bit system, then also install:\n\nOpen up a terminal and run:\n\nIf primus is working properly, you should see \"primus: profiling:\" messages every so often in the terminal you ran it from.\n\nGeneral Usage:\n\nIf you installed primus, then you can use the following command to take advantage of it:\n\nStart Windows applications:\n\nwith primus:\n\nBy default, primus renders up to 60 fps. To render more frames per second:\n\nIn practice this will probably only waste power, as most screens do not display more than 60 frames per second.\n\nYou can always run \"man optirun\" for more information.\n\nIn some cases, users on post Linux 3.4 kernels are unable to use bumblebee with nouveau.\nOne less then optimal workaround is to not use optirun and instead request that the window\nbe drawn using the primary or secondary graphics cards/drivers.  This can be achieved\nusing the following:\n\nThese two commands should produce the demonstration gears and the driver vendor (often Intel and\nnouveau) in the terminal.  For more information see (https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=964012).\n\nMost of the information presented here was suggested by bumblebee maintainer Gary Gatling. \n\nThe verbose output of optirun provided by appending the switch -vv can give us an idea of the issue at hand.\n\nWhen you upgrade from one version of nvidia binary to higher version of the module, sometimes the un-install phase is not complete and in that case this following suggestion should help.\n\n1. First unload the nvidia module by logging in as root in a terminal. Terminal output of cat /proc/apci/bbswitch should be OFF after this step.\n\n2. Uninstall the nvidia module \n\n3. modinfo nvidia probably gives you an output similar to this\n\n4. Prepare to compile the nvidia driver at restart for the current kernel and reboot the system\n\n5. Post reboot should give the modinfo output something similar to this and you should be able to use optirun as intended.\n\nMake sure your nvidia module is unloaded when you do this steps. For some repeating the steps a couple of times was necessary.\n\n\n      Copyright \u00a9 2014 Red Hat, Inc. and others.  All Rights Reserved.

Bee or Carpenter Bee?\nWhen encountering black, almost round bees buzzing around their home most\r\npeople do not know the difference between the bumble bee and  carpenter\r\nbee.\u00a0 There are two basic things to note that should quickly let you know\r\nwhich bee you are seeing: location and activity of bee\r\nand certain physical characteristics of the bee.\nCarpenter bees are most often noticed while they are\r\nbuilding and tending to their nests which are simple, round openings in wood\r\nstructures.\u00a0 If you see a bee that is boring out a perfectly round hole in\r\nwood, it is a carpenter bee.\u00a0 For more information about carpenter bees\r\n(biology, habits, how to control) go to the Carpenter\r\nBee web page.\nBumble bees have a fuzzy abdomen and the Carpenter Bee\r\nhas a shiny abdomen.\nGeneral Bumble Bee Information\nThe \"Bumble Bee\" is a big, hairy, black and yellow bee whose\r\nsize can range from 3/4 inch to 1 1/2 inch.\u00a0 This insect is often mistaken\r\nfor a carpenter bee, which closely resembles the bumble bee in appearance.\u00a0\r\nCarpenter bees have a shiny and smooth abdomen as opposed to the fuzzy abdomen\r\nseen on a bumble bee.\nThere are over 200 types of Bumble bees in the\r\nworld.\u00a0 Fifty different types can be found in North America.\u00a0 Each\r\ndifferent species will have its own preference to types of nectar and prefers\r\ndifferent flowers.\r\nThe bumble bee is an important, beneficial insect.\u00a0 They pollinate plants\r\nand flowers as they forage for food.\u00a0 To gardeners, it is a welcome sight\r\nto see these large, flying insects carrying large loads of pollen, flying into\r\nand around their flower beds and gardens.\u00a0 While busy searching for food\r\n(and at the same time, pollinating plants) bumble bees are rarely a problem when\r\nin close proximity to humans.\u00a0 They will actually (in most cases) go out of\r\ntheir way to avoid human contact.\u00a0 Bumble bees will, however, defend\r\nthemselves if they sense that they are cornered and cannot escape.\u00a0 Most of\r\nthe time they will fly away from danger but will sting if they are under duress.\u00a0\nBumble bees have very few predators in nature.\u00a0 Skunks are their\r\nlargest and most destructive predator.\u00a0 Skunks are\r\nomnivores that will eat insects, rodents,\r\nreptiles, small mammals, worms, eggs, fish, fruit, and plants.\u00a0 When they\r\nlocate a bumble bee nest, skunks help themselves to bee\r\nlarvae and adult insects.\u00a0 They ignore the pain of bee stings to get to\r\ntheir preferred foods.\nThe queen bumble bee comes out of hibernation every\r\nspring to find a new spot to build her nest and start a new colony.\u00a0 This\r\nqueen bee was fertilized the previous season and has managed to live through the\r\nwinter months.\r\nThe same nesting spot (from previous seasons) are rarely used.\u00a0 A suitable\r\nplace for nesting is usually on the ground, beneath a flat object.\u00a0 An old\r\nmouse hole or similar hole in the ground is preferred if it is underneath an old\r\ntarp, flat stone or man made objects such as a deck.\u00a0 The hole chosen by\r\nthe queen bee is first padded by pieces of vegetation such as dry grass or moss.\nIt is in this padded underground hole that the fertilized queen bumble bee\r\nlays her eggs and begins collecting nectar for her soon to hatch grubs.\u00a0 On\r\nthe grubs emerge from their eggs, the queen bumble bee spins a protective silk cocoon\r\nfor each grub.\u00a0 It is from this first batch of larvae that 5 to 20\r\ndaughters emerge.\u00a0 These daughters of the queen bumble bee are workers who\r\nbegin immediately start working on building the colony.\u00a0 The queen bee will\r\ncontinue to lay eggs for the remainder of the summer season.\u00a0 The workers\r\nwork tirelessly to build the colony, collect nectar for the young and also to\r\nprovide protection for the colony.\u00a0 The first batch (or hatching) of bumble\r\nbee workers are smaller than their sisters who will emerge later on when the\r\ncolony grows larger and healthier.\u00a0 The queen bee uses her energy to begin\r\nthe nest and this energy (as well as time) is spread thin as she is the sole\r\nworker for the new colony.\u00a0 As the colony grows, the eggs and larvae are\r\ngiven more attention and food simply because there are many workers that share\r\nthe work load.\u00a0 It is at this point in time that larger bumble bees are\r\nseen.\nBumble bees are often first noticed (in the area of the nest) when this\r\nactivity of guarding the nest and pollen collecting begins.\u00a0 The worker\r\nbees are focused only on their job and will not go out of their way to sting\r\npeople.\u00a0 It is only if people get too close to their nest or threaten them\r\nwhen bumble bees will sting.\u00a0 Bumble bees do not die after stinging, as do\r\nsome other stinging insects.\nTowards late summer, the queen will start to produce drones and young\r\nqueens.\u00a0 The young queens are fertilized by the drones, then fly off to hibernate.\u00a0\r\nHibernation usually takes place in dry protected areas such as loose bark.\u00a0\r\nThe colony's remaining drones and workers stay in the colony and die during the\r\nwinter season.\u00a0 The young queens start new colonies in the spring of the\r\nyear.\u00a0 As mentioned above, bumble bees do not use the same nest though they\r\nmay nest in an area close by to the original bee nest.\nBumble Bee Control\nPest Bumble Bees\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\nNon-Chemical Prevention\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Bee\r\nControl\u00a0\nBumble bees are very important, beneficial insects that pollinate plants\r\nand flowers.\u00a0 Their activity in your gardens are desirable but allowing\r\nthem to nest in areas where children and pets frequent or where you garden is\r\nnot desirable.\nWhen adults, children or pets frequent an area where bumble\r\nbees have made their nests, the beneficial bumble bee can become a pest.\u00a0 A\r\ndisturbed nest is an unhappy and angry nest!\u00a0 Although skunks will tolerate\r\na bee's sting (or multiple stings) while collecting food, other animals cannot\r\ntolerate the sting.\u00a0 Dogs are often on the receiving end of angry\r\nbees.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n[A dog's curiosity can get it into trouble with stinging insects.\u00a0 While\r\ninvestigating the activity of a nest, dogs usually get stung on their face and\r\n(most of the time) their snout and nose are easy targets for the bees.\u00a0\r\nWhen the dog investigates the sounds and activities of a bumble bee nest they\r\nare usually attacked on facial areas, resulting in painful stings accompanied by\r\nlarge swelling at the site of the sting.\u00a0 The size of the swelling can be\r\nalarming, simply because there is very little muscle or fat on most dogs' face\r\nand muzzle area.]\n\r\nTo prevent bees from becoming a stinging pest, take action to remove possible\r\nnesting sites that would put a new colony in close proximity with children and\r\nadults that frequent certain parts of the property.\r\nThere are ways to avoid a bumble bee problem:\nWhen people come into contact with an active nest there are only two\r\nalternatives:\nAs beneficial as bumble bees are, they are indeed a pest when the location\r\nof their nest causes stings to people.\nEliminate Bumble Bees Nest\nWhen the location of a bumble bee nest dictates elimination for safety's sake,\r\ncertain products, techniques and timing are essential.\u00a0 Using the wrong\r\npest control products or using any control products during the peak of bee\r\nactivity are the major mistakes you want to avoid.\u00a0 For instructions on how\r\nto get rid of bumble bees that have become a hazard, see Bumble\r\nBee Control; .\u00a0 The control article will give you choices of\r\nproducts for different locations of bumble bee nests.\nCredits\nOur

FAQ:\n\n\"Bumblebee is an effort to make NVIDIA Optimus enabled laptops work in GNU/Linux systems. Such feature involves two graphics cards with two different power consumption profiles plugged in a layered way sharing a single framebuffer.\"\n\nOptimus Technology is an hybrid graphics implementation without a hardware multiplexer. The integrated GPU manages the display while the dedicated GPU manages the most demanding rendering and ships the work to the integrated GPU to be displayed. When the laptop is running on battery supply, the dedicated GPU is turned off to save power and prolong the battery life. It has also been tested successfully with desktop machines with Intel integrated graphics and an nVidia dedicated graphics card. \n\nBumblebee is a software implementation comprising of two parts:\n\nIt tries to mimic the Optimus technology behavior; using the dedicated GPU for rendering when needed and power it down when not in use. The present releases only support rendering on-demand, automatically starting a program with the discrete video card based on workload is not implemented.\n\nBefore installing Bumblebee check your BIOS and activate Optimus (older laptops call it \"switchable graphics\") if possible (BIOS doesn't have to provide this option), and install the Intel driver for the secondary on board graphics card.\n\nSeveral packages are available for a complete setup:\n\nInstall intel-dri, xf86-video-intel, bumblebee and nvidia. If you have intel-dri and xf86-video-intel installed, you will have to reinstall them together with the rest to avoid a dependency conflict between intel-dri and nvidia. \n\nIf you want to run 32-bit applications (like games with wine) on a 64-bit system you need the lib32-nvidia-utils (and lib32-intel-dri if you intend to use primusrun) package too.\n\nInstall:\n\nIn order to use Bumblebee it is necessary add yourself (and other users) to the bumblebee group:\n\nwhere $USER is the login name of the user to be added. Then log off and on again to apply the group changes.\n\nFinished. Reboot system and use the shell program optirun for Optimus NVIDIA rendering!\n\nIf you simply wish to disable your NVIDIA card, this should be all that is needed, apart from having bbswitch installed. The bumblebeed daemon will, by default, instruct bbswitch to turn off the card when it starts. See also the power management section below.\n\nThe command line program optirun shipped with Bumblebee is your best friend\nfor running applications on your Optimus NVIDIA card.\n\nTest Bumblebee if it works with your Optimus system:\n\nIf it succeeds and the terminal you are running from mentions something about your NVIDIA - Optimus with Bumblebee is working!\n\nIf it fails, try:\n\nGeneral usage:\n\nSome Examples:\n\nStart Windows applications with Optimus:\n\nUse NVIDIA Settings with Optimus:\n\nFor a list of options for optirun view its manual page.\n\nA new program is soon becoming the default choice because of better performance, namely\nprimus. Currently you need to run this program separately (it does not accept options\nunlike optirun), but in the future it will be started by optirun. Usage:\n\nYou can configure the behaviour of Bumblebee to fit your needs. Fine tuning like speed optimization, power management and other stuff can be configured in /etc/bumblebee/bumblebee.conf\n\nBumblebee renders frames for your Optimus NVIDIA card in an invisible X Server with VirtualGL and transports them back to your visible X Server.\n\nFrames will be compressed before they are transported - this saves bandwidth and can be used for speed-up optimization of bumblebee:\n\nTo use an other compression method for a single application:\n\nThe method of compres will affect performance in the GPU/GPU usage. Compressed methods (such as jpeg) will load the CPU the most but will load GPU the minimum necessary; uncompressed methods loads the most on GPU and the CPU will have the minimum load possible.\n\nCompressed methods are: jpeg, rgb, yuv.\n\nUncompressed methods are: proxy, xv.\n\nTo use a standard compression for all applications set the VGLTransport to compress-method in /etc/bumblebee/bumblebee.conf:\n\nYou can also play with the way VirtualGL reads back the pixels from your graphic card. Setting VGL_READBACK environment variable to pbo should increase the performance. Compare these two:\n\nThe goal of power management feature is to turn off the NVIDIA card when it is not used by bumblebee any more.\nIf bbswitch is installed, it will be detected automatically when the Bumblebee daemon starts. No additional\nconfiguration is necessary.\n\nThe default behavior of bbswitch is to leave the card power state unchanged. bumblebeed does disable\nthe card when started, so the following is only necessary if you use bbswitch without bumblebeed.\n\nSet load_state and unload_state module options according to your needs (see bbswitch documentation).\n\nThe NVIDIA card may not correctly initialize during boot if the card was powered off when the system was last shutdown.  One option is to set TurnCardOffAtExit=false in /etc/bumblebee/bumblebee.conf, however this will enable the card everytime you stop the Bumblebee daemon, even if done manually.  To ensure that the NVIDIA card is always powered on during shutdown, add the following systemd service (if using bbswitch):\n\nThen enable the service by running systemctl enable nvidia-enable.service at the root prompt.\n\nIf the port (DisplayPort/HDMI/VGA) is wired to the Intel chip, you can set up multiple monitors with xorg.conf. Set them to use the Intel card, but Bumblebee can still use the NVIDIA card. One example configuration is below for two identical screens with 1080p resolution and using the HDMI out.\n\nYou need to probably change the BusID for both the Intel and the NVIDIA card.\n\nThe BusID is 0:2:0\n\nOn some notebooks, the digital Video Output (HDMI or DisplayPort) is hardwired to the NVIDIA chip. If you want to use all the displays on such a system simultaniously, you have to run 2 X Servers. The first will be using the Intel driver for the notebooks panel and a display connected on VGA. The second will be started through optirun on the NVIDIA card, and drives the digital display.\n\nThere are currently several instructions on the web how such a setup can be made to work. One can be found on the bumblebee wiki page. Another approach is described below.\n\nThis method uses a patched Intel driver, which is extended to have a VIRTUAL Display, and the program hybrid-screenclone which is used to copy the display over from the virtual display to a second X Server which is running on the NVIDIA card using Optirun. Credit goes to Triple-head monitors on a Thinkpad T520 which has a detailed explanation on how this is done on a Ubuntu system.\n\nFor simplicity, DP is used below to refer to the Digital Output (DisplayPort).

While his stature allows him to do his job better than most Autobots could manage, he is self-conscious about his size. Maybe this is why he makes fast friends among the humans. He looks up (so to speak) to the other Autobots, especially Optimus Prime, but what he doesn't realize is that they look up to him.  He may be small, but he's brave, and he's one of the most well-liked Autobots around. Bumblebee already has the respect he craves. But the poor bot seems to get kidnapped a lot. Bumblebee is the Autobot's spy and scout. His talents involve espionage.\n\nAs Goldbug\u2014his rebuilt and \"matured\" form\u2014Bumblebee retains most of his earlier strengths and weaknesses, but crippling need for approval. (This is true of some \"matured\" versions of Bumblebee without new names or bodies, as well, but is quite markedly associated with the change to Goldbug).\n\n\n\n\u2014Bumblebee, on his kid-friendly nature, \"Megatron's Master Plan, Part 1\"\n\n\nBumblebee's first appearance... anywhere.\nFour million years ago, Optimus Prime led a crew of Autobots including Bumblebee aboard the Ark to clear a path through an asteroid belt for Cybertron to pass through.  Once their objective was completed, they were attacked by Decepticons and both their ships crashed in a volcanic mountain on a primitive planet known as Earth.  In 1984, the volcano (Mount Saint Hilary) erupted, awakening their ship, which rebuilt them.  Bumblebee was reconfigured to transform into a yellow Volkswagen Beetle.  The Transformers\n\nProwl led a mission into a human city to investigate their new world.  Bumblebee, anxious to be the first to meet the planet's inhabitants, rear-ended a car full of teenagers at a drive-in movie theater.  Before he could introduce himself, he was under attack by Decepticons and damaged badly.  One of the teenagers, Buster Witwicky, brought the car back to his father's auto repair shop.  Bumblebee weakly pleaded to them to fix him, for he was dying.  Buster's father, Sparkplug Witwicky, fixed Bumblebee and offered to help the Autobots convert their native fuel resources into a form that Transformers could use.  Bumblebee took Buster with him back towards the Ark to relay this message.  Power Play!\n\nRARR! BUMBLEBEE SMAAAAAAASH!\nAfter a seemingly final battle with the Decepticons, the long-lost Decepticon Shockwave arrived and reversed the Autobots' victory with a single blast.  The Last Stand! Bumblebee and the rest of the Autobots were kept captive aboard the Ark until Ratchet managed to free the Ark from Decepticon control and repair them.  DIS-Integrated Circuits! However, Buster had been entrusted with safeguarding the Creation Matrix, which the Decepticons discovered, so Bumblebee and Bluestreak were sent to protect him.  Buster was attacked by the Decepticons' newly-built but lifeless Jetfire.  Bumblebee and Bluestreak did their best to defend Buster, but it was Buster's use of the powers of the Creation Matrix which saved them all, disassembling Jetfire in mid-air.  Bumblebee removed Jetfire's brain so Buster could reassemble and remote-control the body with his mind.  Brainstorm!\n\nAfter the Creation Matrix was returned to a restored Optimus Prime, he was still somewhat disconcerted by his ordeal. When the Decepticon spy Ravage was briefly captured, only to escape again, Bumblebee saw how much this troubled his already upset leader and took it upon himself to chase down and capture the fleeing spy. Unfortunately, he got in over his head and was captured by Soundwave's Decepticons after being led into a box canyon. In order to show the Autobots they meant business, Soundwave had Laserbeak deliver Bumblebee's severed arm to the Ark as a message. Soundwave had learned from Ravage how low Prime's self-confidence was at that juncture, and planned to lure the despondent Autobot leader to his death. Instead, kidnapping Bumblebee just pissed Prime off, and he single-handedly bashed and battered his way through the entire Decepticon front, rescuing Bumblebee and restoring his confidence in the process.  Crisis of Command!\n\nDuring the Dinobot Hunt, Bumblebee went to Alaska with Optimus and Ratchet to reinforce the unit trying to overcome the rampaging Dinobots, Grimlock and Sludge. While scouting the perimeter, Bumblebee was shocked to discover a cloaked Autobot shuttlecraft and three of his comrades who had gone missing earlier in the Hunt. He also discovered a Decepticon-issue sonic lance (that was being used to drive Sludge \"berserker mad\") installed in the ship. Rightly suspecting a booby trap, instead of just turning the device off, Bumblebee instead evacuated his comrades and got a good distance away from the ship before using his gun to blow up the sonic lance. Good call \u2014 the shuttlecraft exploded violently the moment he did so.  Dinobot Hunt\n\nWhen the Autobots took steps to fill out their ranks, Bumblebee was charged with giving four new recruits (Hoist, Skids, Smokescreen, and Tracks) a tour of the planet. Bumblebee decided a Brick Springhorn concert would be a good destination, but the Decepticons had sabotaged the event to harvest energon. Bumblebee disobeyed orders and led the four into battle, saving the concert.  Rock and Roll-Out! When Robot-Master appeared on television and claimed to control the Transformers, it was Bumblebee's job to ask their human business parter, G.B. Blackrock what the deal was. Robot-Master broadcast next in a coal mine next to a de-energized Megatron, but before Bumblebee and several other Autobots could investigate, they were pushed away by overwhelming Earth military forces.  I, Robot-Master!\n\nThis event caused Bumblebee to question his usefulness to the Autobots, and he abandoned them without a word.  The Decepticons, however, saw much use for him and attempted to apprehend him.  Hiding in a used car lot, he was stolen by two humans, whom he adopted for a while.  The Decepticons did not relent, and Bumblebee was ultimately rescued by the rest of the Autobots, an act which reminded him how valuable he was to them.  Plight of the Bumblebee!\n\nIn his earlier appearances, Goldbug kept Bumblebee's body and color scheme.\nDue to conflicting circumstances, Bumblebee was damaged and rebuilt into a stronger but similar form\u2014Goldbug.  Goldbug and Blaster were ordered by the new Autobot leader, Grimlock, to track down the Mechanic, who had stolen Autobot technology from the Ark.  Grimlock was a terrible leader and had no regard for human life, so both Goldbug and Blaster exiled themselves from his command.   Mechanical Difficulties! Goldbug and Blaster found themselves in the desert of the American Southwest and, thanks to a run-in with the Decepticon Triple Changers, were infested with the disease known as Scraplets.  Goldbug and his human friend Charlie Fong left to get help and possibly a cure, but Blaster believed Goldbug had abandoned him to die.  Crater Critters  Near death himself, Goldbug arrived with Charlie at a gas station, where they met up with the Throttlebots, sent from Cybertron by Ratbat and armed with acid to contain the disease.  Goldbug narrowly escaped extermination when it was discovered that the cure for Scraplets was none other than ordinary water.  Goldbug called industrialist G.B. Blackrock (on a pay phone), and Blackrock trucked in tanks of water himself.  Blaster was cured and his trust in Goldbug was restored.  The Cure!\n\nGoldbug finished his evolution into his own character model by the time the Throttlebots showed up.  He kept Bumblebee's colors, though.\nWith the Throttlebots joining Goldbug and Blaster on their travels, the group discovered that the bodies of Galvatron and Ultra Magnus had been found.  While they initially intended to let the Combaticons destroy Galvatron, they were forced to intervene to save human lives.  Ladies' Night  This unfortunately attracted the wrath of the Combaticons.  The group found refuge in a used car lot owned by Big Steve.  However, they were all badly in need of fuel.  They attempted a deal with Big Steve, but he double-crossed them, filling them up with soda pop instead of gasoline.  It was then that the Protectobot caught up with them, followed by the Combaticons.  During the ensuing battle, the immobilized Throttlebots (including Goldbug) were carted away by the humans' anti-robot organization, RAAT.  Used Autobots\n\nGoldbug and the captured Throttlebots were interrogated by Triple-I, who eventually had their bodies crushed in a pointless threat to stop Decepticon raids.  However, their brain modules were transplanted by Walter Barnett into remote-control cars owned by his son, who sought out Goldbug's old friend Buster at Goldbug's suggestion.  After being attacked by the Predacons and separated from the others, Goldbug and Buster traveled to Mount St. Hilary and found the Ark gone.  Using equipment left behind, Goldbug and Buster sent a distress call, just before Ratbat revealed he'd tagged along and crushed the Autobot's toy car body.  Toy Soldiers!\n\nArriving in response to his distress call, the Autobot Headmasters rescued Goldbug's shattered form, Chromedome patching into his circuits to ease the pain of retelling the attack and capture of Buster.  Trial by Fire!.  Taken back to their ship, Brainstorm built him a new body identical to his Throttlebot form.  Goldbug used it on a mission that led to the discovery that Optimus Prime's mind was recorded on floppy disk and served as his leader's eyes in commanding the Autobot Pretenders.  Pretender to the Throne!\n\nGoldbug championed the reconstruction of his former leader's body, until his present allies suggested contacting the Ark to seek the resources to do it.  Goldbug was quickly imprisoned by Grimlock, but this allowed him to convince Blaster to fight the Dinobot.  After the Decepticons attacked during the pair's duel, Fortress Maximus ordered Goldbug to take the Steelhaven and its skeleton crew back to Nebulos to rebuild Optimus Prime.  Totaled!\n\nArriving on Nebulos, Goldbug and the others were successful in rebuilding Optimus Prime despite the planet's now-toxic fuel.  Goldbug avoided having to undergo the Powermaster process to survive like the other Autobots due to his high fuel efficiency.  People Power!  On the journey back, Optimus and Goldbug investigated word of Sky Lynx starring in the Cosmic Carnival, eventually rescuing the Autobot and his young human companions.  The Cosmic Carnival!\n\nRatchet cares not for your maturation and wishes you were more like 1984.\nGoldbug was later destroyed by the Underbase-powered Starscream in New York.  Dark Star! Goldbug was repaired by Ratchet using Pretender technology...sort of.  Instead of simply restoring Goldbug, Ratchet rebuilt him as a much larger Bumblebee  All the Familiar Faces!, explaining that he'd always preferred Bumblebee's original form.  Before they could discuss it further, Bumblebee had to help Jazz and Grimlock against Megatron and his minions. While the new Pretenders defeated the other Decepticons, Ratchet seemingly sacrificed himself to destroy Megatron and his base.  Skin Deep\n\nAfterward, the three Pretenders briefly joined the Autobot resistance movement on Cybertron.  Thanks to his increased stature, Bumblebee experienced a big boost of confidence as he and the others rejuvenated the resistance.  In response, Thunderwing ordered the Mayhem Attack Squad to assassinate them.  As Bumblebee, Jazz, Grimlock and the Rescue Patrol prepared to teleport to Earth, the three Decepticons attacked Autobase, sabotaging the trans-time dimensional portal.  All nine Transformers found themselves teleported into the heart of Cybertron, where the Autobots discovered the resting place of Primus.  Yesterday's Heroes!\n\nThere, they encountered the Keeper and learned the secret origin of the Transformers, as well as of Primus's never-ending battle with Unicron. As the Keeper's tale ended, the Mayhem Attack Squad found the Autobots.  Their initial attack destroyed the Keeper, but Bumblebee and the others handily defeated them.  However, a stray blast woke Primus seconds before the repaired portal sent the Transformers back to Earth.  Primal Scream\n\nBumblebee's Pretender shell was forgotten after this battle, presumably (conveniently?) destroyed.\nWith Unicron undoubtedly on his way to devour Cybertron, Bumblebee and his fellow Pretenders embarked on a quest to find the lost Creation Matrix.  The three traveled to VsQs, the last known location of Optimus Prime's funeral barge, to search for clues.  Finding an abandoned science station, Bumblebee searched through its computer records.  He confirmed that the scientists had found Prime's body and the Matrix, but also a strange creature that promptly attacked one of the scientists.  Before they could investigate further, Thunderwing attacked, also seeking the Matrix.  Bumblebee used his Pretender shell to combat the Decepticon, only for Thunderwing to destroy it.  The feedback temporarily knocked Bumblebee unconscious, and it seemed Thunderwing would destroy all three Autobots, until the Matrix Spawn attacked.  While Thunderwing pursued the creature, Bumblebee and the other Autobots searched the science station for the Matrix.  They recovered it, but were so low on Energon that they were becoming unable to compensate for the moon's heavy gravity.  While they were attempting to reach their shuttle, Thunderwing overtook them, seizing the Matrix and leaving them for dead.  Dark Creation Fortunately for Bumblebee, the Autobots sent a shuttle to rescue him and the others before they entered final shutdown.  Eye of the Storm!\n\nBumblebee survived the war with Unicron, and was one of many Autobots left on Cybertron afterwards.  Exodus!\n\nIn 2007, Bumblebee was stationed on Cybertron after Unicron destroyed Moonbase Two. Under the command of Rodimus Prime and Ultra Magnus, he helped ambush a group of Decepticon attackers, catching them in a pre-planned crossfire.  Wanted - Galvatron Dead or Alive\n\nWhen Optimus Prime left Grimlock in charge of protecting Earth, Bumblebee signed up for the new \"Earthforce\" along with many of his long-time comrades.  Break-Away! After Prowl disappeared while riding an atmosphere-destroying missile through the stratosphere (long story), Bumblebee and Ironhide went looking for him. They picked up a set of Transformer life signs on a small island in the Bahamas, and took some speeder bikes to investigate. Instead of Prowl, what they found was a massive reconstructed version of Devastator, half-finished as the Constructicons attempted to recreate their combined form as an independent super-warrior. Luckily, Bumblebee had Ironhide along to disable the automated defense ring protecting the Devastator project, and they were able to destroy \"him\" before the Constructicons could activate their creation.  Desert Island Risks!\n\nLater, Bumblebee joined Jazz, Ironhide and Sunstreaker in infiltrating the Decepticon Enclave. Fearing an alliance between the two Decepticon factions would be bad news for the Autobots, Ironhide conceived a plan to throw a spanner into the proceedings. Using an unconscious Headstrong as a patsy, the Autobots staged a sniper shot at Megatron. When Megatron and his Decepticons unleashed their firepower at the rocks where the shot supposedly came from, Jazz and Bumblebee tossed down Headstrong's body, leading Megatron to conclude Shockwave had tried to have him killed. The peace talks quickly went downhill from there.  The Bad Guys' Ball!\n\nBumblebee was present when Wheeljack showcased his brand-new defense grid to successfully protect Autobot Earthbase. Unfortunately, Wheels forgot that, once activated, the defense system could only be deactivated from inside the base...behind the various laser cannons and heat-seekers and Acidbats he had turned on. While Prowl ran the gauntlet to reach the control center, Bumblebee and Jazz watched his back, drawing fire and disabling what defenses they could.  The House that Wheeljack Built! Later, Bumblebee and several other Autobots went in pursuit of Motormaster of the Stunticons, who had kidnapped their human ally, Irwin Spoon. Weaving their way through the various Stunticons who got in the way, Bumblebee and Tracks finally managed to trick two of Motormaster's own thugs into running him off the road themselves, giving Bumblebee a chance to rip off his cab door and retrieve Spoon.  End of the Road!\n\nAin't variant continuity FUN?!\nIn G.I. Joe and the Transformers, Bumblebee was destroyed by G.I. Joe due to a misunderstanding. They later rebuilt him as Goldbug with help from Ratchet. However, Marvel UK did not initially print the crossover, so an alternate origin for Goldbug was conceived.  In the pages of the UK comic, Bumblebee was destroyed by a time-traveling Death's Head and repaired by a time-traveling Wreck-Gar. (The Marvel Joe/TF crossover was published in the UK towards the end of the series.) The conflicting origins for Goldbug is the single largest difference between the American and British Marvel Transformers comics; most everything else kinda sorta meshes together, if you squint.\n\n\nA friendly game of Bumblebowling, honest\nYears after the battle on Klo, and the Autobots had returned to a renewed Cybertron, Bumblebee received a distress signal from G.I. Joe on Earth, notifying them of Megatron's return. He passed this information on to Optimus Prime.   Goin' South He also accompanied Prime and a team of Autobots to an unnamed planet home to an ancient civilization which reportedly stored a cache of superweapons, and battled the Decepticons there until a monstrous native scared them away.  Ghosts\n\nBumblebee was among the Autobot/Decepticon forces battling the Cybertronian Empire on Ethos.   Escalation!\n\n\n\nThis character article is a stub and is missing information on their fictional appearances. You can help Teletraan I: The Transformers Wiki by expanding it.\n\n\n\nBumblebee's Cybertronian form could give Cosmos a run for his money.\nAfter pilfering energy conductors with Wheeljack, Bumblebee boarded the Ark with several other Autobots under the leadership of Optimus Prime to search for energy.  After Decepticons attacked the Ark, Bumblebee, along with the battle's participants and their two ships, crash landed on Earth 4 million years ago.  They all laid dormant until 1984 when the Ark's computers were shaken alive as the volcano it crashed into erupted.  Bumblebee was rebuilt to transform into a Volkswagen Beetle.   More Than Meets the Eye, Part 1  After befriending the humans Spike Witwicky and his father Sparkplug after a Decepticon attack on an oil rig  More Than Meets the Eye, Part 2, Bumblebee was part of the team of Autobots sent to stop Megatron and the Decepticons from overpowering Sherman Dam. Bumblebee helped Ironhide carve out a new riverbed for the raging waters, saving a nearby neighborhood from being flooded. Such acts were one of the earliest that helped endear the Autobots to the humans.   More Than Meets the Eye, Part 3\n\nDuring the Decepticon development of their Space Bridge program, Megatron captured Bumblebee and altered a bank of his memory circuits to lure the Autobots into a trap. Bumblebee recovered in time to alert the Autobots to the true location of the Space Bridge.  Transport to Oblivion\n\nIn 2005, he and Spike were on Moonbase One when it was eaten by Unicron. Luckily, Unicron takes some time to digest things, and the two (as well as Jazz and Cliffjumper) were spared an acid-bath in Unicron's guts by the timely arrival of Spike's son Daniel.  The Transformers: The Movie\n\nBumblebee appeared very rarely afterwards (but at least he had survived the movie!!!), although he was stationed on Earth at Metroplex for a time, apparently under Blaster's command. He was present when Scourge and Starscream's ghost came to Metroplex in an attempt to steal the giant's eyes for Unicron. When the Decepticons' invasion set the city on red alert, Bumblebee and Spike teamed up to search the complex for the attackers, just like old times. Running across Scourge in Metroplex's brain, they managed a drive-by ramming that knocked the tracker off balance, but ended up crashing and locking themselves inside Metroplex's voice control room. Guess they were really out of practice with their teamwork.  Ghost in the Machine\n\nSee?  He still looks sorta friendly.\nEeeyeeaaggh!\nWhen the body of Optimus Prime was retrieved by Gregory Swofford and Jessica Morgan, Rodimus Prime led a team that included Bumblebee to investigate.  However, Bumblebee and his teammates were attacked by a Hate Plague-infested Superion and heavily damaged.   The Return of Optimus Prime, Part 1  After Optimus Prime was rebuilt by the Quintessons, so too was Bumblebee into a more powerful but similar form.  Bumblebee remarked that he now looked like a \"gold bug\".  Optimus Prime decided this would be his new name.  \n\nGoldbug journeyed with Optimus Prime and the other survivors to Chaar in search of a heat-resistant alloy that could insulate Prime from the Hate Plague.  However, infected Decepticon forces attacked and contaminated Goldbug as well.  Goldbug and every other contaminated being were restored when Optimus Prime retrieved the Matrix and unleashed the remainder of its energy.   The Return of Optimus Prime, Part 2\n\nIn an animation error, both Bumblebee and Goldbug are among the cheering crowds after the Plasma Energy Chamber ushers in a new Golden Age of Cybertron.  The Rebirth, Part 3\n\n\nGoldbug and the Throttlebots appear a few times; their only real actions of note are attempting to deal with a strange metal-warping asteroid and being horribly twisted and warped by it. They were retrieved and repaired, and in the penultimate episode, the whole Throttlebots team tried to stop a Predaking bent on sinking ships and raiding villages, but were again defeated.\n\nSometimes, toy-accuracy is a strange, strange thing.\nIn the year 2011, after the resurrection of Optimus Prime and Bumblebee's transformation into Goldbug, the two Autobots traveled to the planet Quintessa and rescued the Kiss Players and their partner Sparkbots from the Sharkticon pit, also freeing their spaceship from the Quintessons' trap.   Kiss Players\n\nBumblebee, Spike, and Hound happened upon a badly damaged Starscream while out racing.  Bumblebee convinced the others to bring Starscream back to the Ark for repairs, under the rationale that while Starscream wouldn't have done the same for them, they weren't Decepticons.  Redemption Center\n\nHey, remember that time in the comics when a couple of guys stole Bumblebee?  What if they were kind of jerks?  What if Bumblebee decided to make them pee themselves?  Joyride\n\nAt the death of Sentinel Prime, Bumblebee was part of an Autobot unit defending Altihex from the Decepticons. Grimlock ordered him, Jazz, Prowl, and others to the ruins of Praxus, where Grimlock declared that if the new Prime was unable to lead successfully, they would take control of the war's leadership...and take out the Prime. Bumblebee was among the group that was present for the Matrix transfer ceremony, where Optronix became Optimus Prime. When a Decepticon assassination squad arrived and Optimus kicked some exhaust port, Bumblebee declared that he was \"awesome\". However, Prime then ordered the Autobots to prepare an evacuation of Cybertron. During Shockwave's attack on Iacon, Bumblebee manned a turret in the Decagon. Eventually, Prowl ordered the Autobots to take them on individually, and Bumblebee went out carrying a cannon that was as big as him. Bumblebee survived the destruction of Iacon, and Prime reversed his order of evacuation.  The War Within\n\nSomeone has to pay for the little things.\nBumblebee was one of the Ark crew that crashed on Earth and awoke in 1984. During that time, he met Spike Witwicky, becoming close friends with the human. In 1999, the Autobots and humans allied and managed to capture the Decepticons, taking them in the Ark II back to Cybertron, along with seven humans, including Sparkplug Witwicky, Spike's father. However, the Ark II was sabotaged by rogue elements of the United States military (apparently as part of a plan by Shockwave).  Prime Directive issue 1 The humans were all killed, but a number of Transformers, including Bumblebee, survived, but in stasis lock. Bumblebee's body was recovered by General Hallo and Adam Rook, but Rook stole Bumblebee and a number of other Transformers, selling them to various terrorists. Megatron broke free, and the Seekers, being dicks, disassembled and played with Bumblebee's various components.  Prime Directive issue 3\n\nOptimus Prime's team later rescued him and the remaining Autobots, and they were all put to work in combating Megatron's techno-virus.  Prime Directive issue 5 Unfortunately, the Canadian military, skittish over the recent Transformer violence, attacked the Autobots. Despite this, Bumblebee tried to save as many of the soldiers as he could before the virus could kill them.  Prime Directive issue 6\n\n25 years before someone realized his toy has no face.\nBumblebee commanded the Autobot Shuttle Orion when the Combaticons and Starscream attacked the Ark on Earth  Night of the Combaticons. The little ship managed to damage Bruticus significantly before the super-powerful zealot Sunstorm shorted out its engines and it crashed.  Black Sunshine. After Jetfire sacrificed himself to stop Sunstorm, Bumblebee deserted the Autobot army (for no stated reason). He headed to Spike's house, but Spike, resentful of the death of Sparkplug, lashed out at him. Afterward, Spike finally realized he was harsh on his old friend, and the two went for a night on the town, where they stopped a mugging.  Lost and Found\n\n\n\nBumblebee transformed into a WWII-era motorcycle with side-car. During their joint efforts to stop the Cobra/Decepticon axis of power he teamed with the G.I. Joe member Scarlett. Bumblebee felt they made a good team and she could ride him any time\u2014how cheeky!\n\nPresumably he shut down with the other Transformers when the Matrix was destroyed.\n\nIt could be worse, I guess.\nBumblebee and Wheeljack were the only Transformers aboard the Ark to avoid capture and reprogramming by Cobra, a ruthless terrorist organization determined to rule the world. After disguising themselves as a Volkswagen Beetle and Lancia Stratos, respectively, the two tried to work out a way to free their comrades. They joined forces with G.I. Joe, G.I. Joe turned on them, Bumblebee and Wheeljack saved them anyway, Bumblebee beat up Storm Shadow's robotic armor, and they ultimately saved the Earth from nuclear holocaust.  G.I. Joe vs. the Transformers\n\nLater, Bumblebee was sent back through time to 1970s Earth by a malfunctioning Teletran 3, which also helpfully disguised him as a Ford Pinto. Bumblebee was unamused.

Su redesigned Bumblebee for the IDW Infiltration series. Deal with it.\nHey! Look at that hot brunette! No... not that one!\nBumblebee was part of Prowl's secret counter-infiltration unit on Earth.  When Ratchet broke cover by rescuing a trio of humans, Bumblebee was the one Autobot who supported his efforts. He was true to his role as an espionage agent and ferreted out their plans to continue joint operations against orders and joined in. He accompanied Ratchet and the humans to investigate an abandoned Decepticon bunker in Nebraska.  At the bunker, while the humans were inside, two Decepticons attacked, and Bumblebee managed to take down Skywarp, but not before Ratchet was shot and run over by Blitzwing.  Infiltration issue 4\n\nBumblebee left the humans with Ratchet and traveled to Oregon, the location of the second Decepticon command bunker, observing the situation until the rest of the Autobot unit could arrive. After witnessing Megatron \"disciplining\" Starscream and subsequently downgrading the infiltration unit's status to Phase Two, Bumblebee departed Oregon with the rest of the unit.  Infiltration issue 6\n\nBumblebee was tasked by Nightbeat to check the area surrounding their base for surveillance.  He found a great deal of it, prompting the decision to relocate the Ark-19.  He was aboard when the ship was shot down by Sixshot.  Devastation issue 1 He survived but was injured in the subsequent battle with Sixshot.  Devastation issue 4\n\nGoldbug, a separate entity from Bumblebee, was commander of the Throttlebots, stationed at Orvus base to safe guard the research of an Autobot science lab on Salwatan VI.  When the lab was destroyed by Sixshot, the Throttlebots fled with the data, tracking Cybertronian life signs to nearby Salwatan VIII in hopes of assistance.  The planet appeared to be abandoned and the Throttlebots were left to fight the powerful Sixshot alone, during which Goldbug was shot almost clean through the torso.  He survived the attack, barely, thanks to the efforts of Metroplex, who drove off Sixshot and provided energon to the damaged unit before departing.

When the climate became too cold for the war to continue, Bumblebee and the other Autobots entered into stasis lock to prevent further damage. Thousands of years later,  Bumblebee awoke to the age of humans from the noise of John Henry's hammering.  Bumblebee was impressed by the humans' industriousness, and disguised himself as a small steam locomotive with no control cab, and a built in steam-hammer for driving spikes.   Hearts of Steel issue 1 Initially, 'Bee directly competed with steel-driving legend John Henry. After Bumblebee revealed himself in robot form to Henry, Henry set aside his mistrust of automation after realizing that Bumblebee was a living being (not just a machine) who wanted to put in a fair day's work.   Hearts of Steel issue 2\n\nBumblebee woke several of his fellow Autobots, who soon discovered that the Decepticons were also active in this era. After taking on locomotive alt modes themselves,  Hearts of Steel issue 3  Bumblebee, the Autobots, and their new human friends worked together to prevent the Decepticons' mighty Astrotrain from reaching New York City.  With the Decepticons defeated, Bumblebee and the Autobots returned to their slumber.

Oh, and that since the Autobots now knew Flamewar's whereabouts and who she was working for, the Tripredacus Council would certainly consider her a liability. Which they did.

Paper wasps are also sometimes called umbrella wasps, due to the distinctive design of their nests.[1]\n\n\nThe name \"paper wasps\" typically refers to members of the vespid subfamily Polistinae, though it often colloquially includes members of the subfamilies Vespinae (hornets and yellowjackets) and Stenogastrinae, which also make nests out of paper. Twenty-two species of Polistes paper wasps have been identified in North America and approximately 300 species have been identified worldwide. The most common paper wasp in Europe is Polistes dominula.[2] The Old World tribe Ropalidiini contains another 300 species, and the neotropical tribes Epiponini and Mischocyttarini each contain over 250 more, so the total number of true paper wasps worldwide is about 1100 species, almost half of which can be found in the neotropics.\nThe nests of most true paper wasps are characterized by having open combs with cells for brood rearing, and a 'petiole', or constricted stalk, that anchors the nest.[3] Paper wasps secrete a chemical which repels ants, which they spread around the base of the anchor to prevent the loss of eggs or brood.\nMost social wasps of the family Vespidae make nests from paper, but some stenogastrine species, such as Liostenogaster flavolineata, use mud. A small group of eusocial crabronid wasps, of the genus Microstigmus (the only eusocial wasps outside the family Vespidae), also constructs nests out of chewed plant fibers, though the nest consistency is quite different from those of true paper wasps, due to the absence of wood fibers, and the use of silk to bind the fibers.[4]\nNests can be found in sheltered areas, such as the eaves of a house, the branches of a tree, on the end of an open pipe, or on an old clothesline.\nUnlike yellowjackets and hornets, which can be very aggressive, polistine paper wasps will generally only attack if they themselves or their nest are threatened.[5] Since their territoriality can lead to attacks on people, and because their stings are quite painful and can produce a potentially fatal anaphylactic reaction in some individuals, nests in human-inhabited areas may present an unacceptable hazard.[6]\nMost wasps are beneficial in their natural habitat, and are critically important in natural biocontrol.[3] Paper wasps feed on nectar and other insects, including caterpillars, flies, and beetle larvae. Because they are a known pollinator and feed on known garden pests, paper wasps are often considered to be beneficial by gardeners.[6]\nRecent research has discovered paper wasps have facial recognition abilities comparable to humans.[7][8] One recent study conducted at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor showed paper wasps have the same facial recognition abilities common to humans or chimps.\n\"Faces are extremely important to species such as humans\", said the study coauthor Michael Sheehan, a Ph.D. candidate at the university. \"Studies show that when you look at a face, your brain treats it in a totally different way than it does other images,\" he said. \"It's just the way the brain processes the image of a face, and it turns out that these paper wasps do the same thing.\"\nThe study consisted of a series of tests on the Polistes fuscatus species of paper wasp. This particular species is unique in that it has extremely variable facial patterns from member to member. Sheehan and evolutionary biologist Elizabeth Tibbetts placed individual wasps into a T-shaped maze, with one image shown at each end of the top T arm. Images varied from caterpillars, simple geometric patterns, and computer-altered wasp faces to pictures of a genuine paper wasp faces. These images were interchanged randomly during testing.\nAccording to Sheehan, whenever the wasp in the maze chose the side of the T arm with the correct picture, it would get a reward, in this case a safety zone. Though images were always changed, \"one particular image was always associated with the safety zone,\" Sheehan explained. Once the wasps associated the right image with the safety zone, they were able to choose the correct image and thus get to the safety zone essentially every time after. This suggests that the paper wasps' brains are tuned to recognize faces of their own species\u2014as with humans.\n\"Wasps and humans have independently evolved similar and very specialized face-learning mechanisms, despite the fact that everything about the way we see and the way our brains are structured is different,\" Sheehan said. \"That's surprising and sort of bizarre.\" The unique, distinct faces of paper wasps, as well as the wasps' ability to recognize and remember each other's faces, are likely tied to the insects' multicolony social structure, Sheehan added. \"They have multiple queens and they all want to reproduce\u2014they all want to be the most dominant. So being able to recognize each other helps them understand who's already beaten whom, who has higher ranking in the hierarchy, and this helps to keep the peace.\"\nRecent research conducted by scientists of University of Granada and University of Almeria has shown that the size of the body and color intensity of the body can be used as a measurement to find out the amount of toxic ability of each paper wasp. The toxin of paper wasps is highly toxic to predatory mammals like wolves and cats, as well as birds of prey. The paper wasps with high color intensity and large body produce lethal amount of toxin against other animals."], ["Paper Wasps - Facts About Paper Wasps - Orkin", "http://www.orkin.com/stinging-pests/wasps/paper-wasps/", "Share this page:\nIn North America alone, there are over 22 species of paper wasps. Paper wasps belong to the genus Polistes. Worldwide, there are over 200 species. These wasps measure 1.9 to 3.2 cm in length. Their narrow bodies are most commonly dark brown in color, with black wings and yellow markings. Some even appear similar to yellow jackets in coloration.\nThese insects are called paper wasps due to the construction of their nests. Paper wasp nests are made from plant material combined with saliva and appear to be made from paper. Their nests include numerous compartments within which wasps lay their eggs and rear their young. The nests typically do not have an outer shell with the cells of the nest visible. In fact, it somewhat resembles an umbrella and is the reason they may be called umbrella wasps. These nests are frequently found in sheltered areas, such as door frames, window sill and the eaves of houses.\nPaper wasps feed on nectar and pollen, although they also hunt for insects such as caterpillars with which to nourish their colonies\u2019 larvae. As larvae develop into adults, they assist in expanding the nest and nurturing future generations.\nPaper wasps are considered beneficial because they assist in pollination by feeding on nectar, and they control pest insect populations by feeding them to their larvae. However, despite their ecological benefits, paper wasp nests should not be permitted to develop in or near the home. Stings from paper wasps are extremely painful and may produce serious reactions to people who are allergic to the venom.\nRemoving a paper wasp nest may be dangerous. It is advised that a pest control professional be contacted to assist in treatment of paper wasp infestations.\n\n\n\n\nPaper Wasp Video\n\nPaper Wasp Species\nHow Do Paper Wasps Get In Homes?\nPaper Wasp Colony\n\n\t\tGive us a call:\n        \n844-514-3980\n\n\nOr schedule a call with an Orkin Specialist today and get a FREE estimate for:\n\n\t\tThis branch appears close by:\n\t\t\n\n,  \n\n\nNot in ?\n\t\tEnter a zip code below to view local branches.\n\u00a0"], ["Paper Wasps \u2013 How to Control Paper Wasps - Insects", "http://insects.about.com/od/insectssociety/a/Control-Paper-Wasps.htm", "Send to a Friend via Email\nThis field is required.\nSeparate multiple addresses with commas.

In some cases, it may be necessary to control paper wasps to minimize such risk.\nPaper wasps construct the familiar, open-celled paper nests we often see suspended from eaves or porch ceilings. Most species in North America belong to the genus Polistes. Paper wasps do serve an important ecological purpose as predators of other insects. They collect caterpillars, beetle larvae, and other insect prey to feed their young. \nEach year, the paper wasp queen must build a new nest, which she does by masticating wood fibers into a pliable pulp. Once she raises her first generation of workers, these offspring will assume the role of construction workers, expanding the nest to meet the needs of the growing colony. By summer, the paper wasp nest can be quite large, reaching a width of 6-8 inches. In fall, freezing temperatures will kill all but the queen, who seeks shelter and hibernates for the winter. The nest degrades over winter and is rarely reused the next year.\nAs with any insect, it's important to identify the insect before determining how and when control is necessary. Be sure you know the differences between wasps, yellowjackets, and hornets before taking action.\nPaper wasps can and will sting in defense of their nest, or when threatened. Unlike honeybees, which have barbed stings and can only sting once, paper wasps can sting multiple times. A paper wasp can call other colony members using alarm pheromones, chemical messages that tell other wasps to help defend the nest from a threat. Try to stay calm and avoid swatting at paper wasps. Follow my tips for avoiding bee stings.\nBefore you do anything to get rid of paper wasps around your home, ask yourself if you can tolerate their presence and leave them alone. Paper wasps help keep hungry caterpillars and other plant pests in check, benefiting your landscape and garden. If a paper wasp nest is located on your property but away from high use areas, consider leaving them alone. While they do sting, they only do so in response to a threat. Humans and paper wasps can often coexist peacefully. Obviously, when someone in your household has a wasp venom allergy, you may need to remove wasp nests to minimize the risk of an allergic reaction to a sting.\nIf a nest is located near an entrance to your home, or by a porch or deck where you spend a lot of time, you may need to take action to control paper wasps. Check eaves, shutters, and other high traffic areas in your yard early in the spring, when paper wasp queens are first building their nests. If you find a nest before the first generation of workers have reached adulthood, you can simply knock the nest down with a broom to discourage the queen from nesting in that location.\nLarger nests, or those found later in the season, should be handled cautiously. Never attempt to remove an active wasp nest during the day, when paper wasps are actively flying in and out of the nest. Wait until evening, when the wasps have settled in for the night, to treat or remove any paper wasp nest. During periods of cool weather, you may be able to treat wasp nests, as wasps become lethargic when temperatures dip down to 50\u00b0F or lower.\nThough I rarely recommend the use of chemical pesticides, the safest method of eradicating paper wasps in a problem area is, indeed, with a commercial wasp spray. Look for a product labeled for use on wasps and hornets, and remember, the label is the law. You must read the label and follow all directions for using any pesticide product. Wasp sprays usually come with a propellant that allows you to spray the pesticide from a safe distance. Coat the nest in the pesticide, making sure to cover all the cells of the paper wasp nest. Never stand below the wasp nest while applying the pesticide. Wasps may drop from the nest, and you also risk getting the chemical in your eyes or on your skin.\nBe sure to check the nest the next day for any signs of wasp activity. Before you remove a nest, you must be sure that no workers survived the pesticide application. Wasp sprays kill on contact. Wasps that were absent from the nest at the time you sprayed may return to the nest site. If you don't observe live wasps near the nest, use a broom or other long-handled tool to knock it down. Dispose of the nest properly. I recommend placing the nest in a sealed baggie and placing it in your household trash.\n Sources:\nAbout Education\u00a0Follow us:\n\n \n \n \n \n\nWe deliver.

Paper wasps will defend their nest if attacked. Adults forage for nectar, their source of energy, and for caterpillars to feed the larvae (young). They are natural enemies of many garden insect pests. A widespread North American species is the golden paper wasp.\nThe nests of most species are suspended from a single, central stalk and have the shape of an upside-down umbrella. Some tropical species make nests that hang in a vertical sheet of cells. Plant and wood fibers are collected by the wasps, mixed with saliva, and chewed into a papier-m\u00each?-like material that is formed into the thin cells of the nest. The nests are constructed in protected places, such as under the eaves of buildings or in dense vegetation. Normally a colony of several to several dozen paper wasps inhabit the nest.\nThe colony is founded in early spring, soon after the queens (mated females) emerge from hibernation. As the colony matures, males and the next year's queens are produced. These queens mate with males and are the only members of the colony to survive through winter. In late summer or fall, the founding queen, workers (unmated females), and males all die. The newly mated queens hibernate, typically in piles of wood, in vegetation, or in holes. The following spring they emerge and begin the cycle anew. A similar life cycle is found in bumble bees.\nIn most temperate species of paper wasps, colonies are founded by one female who dominates the colony and lays most of the eggs. This female constructs the nest, lays eggs, forages, and raises the first generation of offspring. She then stops foraging, becomes the queen, and rules by dominating her offspring of workers. This is a classic dominance hierarchy with the queen maintaining control through aggressive interactions. Each individual in line maintains dominance over all others below her through confrontation and aggressive interactions. If the queen dies or is otherwise lost, the most aggressive worker takes over. This worker begins laying eggs and continues to dominate all below her. Since the workers have not mated, they can only lay unfertilized eggs, which develop into males, a typical trait in wasps.\nSome queens that are unsuccessful at establishing their own nest may join another queen, submitting to her dominance and becoming a worker. Studies have shown that such individuals, called joiners, are most often sisters of the queen. Since this individual mated the previous fall, her eggs can develop into workers and she could become the next queen if the founding queen is lost. Occasionally a joiner dominates the founding queen and takes over the nest, a behavior known as usurpation. In such rare cases, the usurper becomes the queen and the previous queen becomes a worker.\nScientific classification: Paper wasps are in the genus Polistes in the family Vespidae, which also includes potter wasps, yellow jackets, and hornets.

In such rare cases, the usurper becomes the queen and the previous queen becomes a worker.\nScientific classification: Paper wasps are in the genus Polistes in the family Vespidae, which also includes potter wasps, yellow jackets, and hornets. The golden paper wasp is Polistes fuscatus.\n\u00a0\nSome queens that are unsuccessful at establishing their own nest may join another queen, submitting to her dominance and becoming a worker. Studies have shown that such individuals, called joiners, are most often sisters of the queen.

We are not pest control professionals.  This is a total amateur job.  Keep that in mind as you view the video.  Also, for some reason the not so neat application of duct tape really gets under people's skin so before you curse me out for my improper use of duct tape try applying it yourself with leather gloves on and a hood on your head.  We got a call to get some bees out of a wall in a second story room and when we got there we found that they were wasps.  Since we have the protective gear and they couldn't get a pest control company to show up on short notice I agreed to go ahead and get them out.  I thought a bug bomb would do the job but it had little effect.  We did what some consider a very rough removal of the wasps and left an empty wall and happy people.\n\n\n\nLoading...\n    \n\n\n\n\nLoading...\n    \n\n\n\n\nLoading...\n    \n\n\n\n\nLoading...\n

In fact, it is not likely to \r\nmake any lists!\nAdult paper wasps are efficient \r\npredators, mostly of caterpillars. They carry them back to the nest and feed \r\nthem to the developing larvae. They will collect large numbers of caterpillars \r\nfrom the area around the nest during the course of a season. Adult wasps typically prey on a wide variety of caterpillars \r\nincluding corn earworms, armyworms, loopers, and hornworms. Adult wasps also \r\nutilize beetle larvae and flies as food for their young..\nAdult paper wasps primarily feed on \r\nnectar or other sugary solutions such as honeydew and the juices of ripe fruits. \r\nAdults also feed on bits of caterpillars or flies that are caught and partially \r\nchewed before presenting to their young.\nIt is their painful stinging ability \r\nthat causes alarm and fear. Unless the threat of stings and nest location \r\npresents a hazard around the home, it is often best to wait for Mother Nature to \r\nkill these annual colonies with the onset of cool weather in late November and \r\nDecember.\nPaper wasps are \u00be to 1 inch long. \r\nTheir colors vary with different species. They should not be confused with \r\nhornets or yellow jackets. The paper wasp is sometimes called the \u201cumbrella \r\nwasp\u201d because their nests consist of a single exposed comb suspended by a narrow \r\nstalk. The adult wasps typically prey on caterpillars, flies, crickets and other \r\npests. However, they will sting to defend their nests.\nThe female wasp will feed chewed up \r\ncaterpillars and other prey to her young wasp larvae until they seal their cells \r\nin the nest and become pupae. Whenever enough female worker wasps have emerged, \r\nthey take over the duties of food collection and nest construction and defense, \r\nwhile the queen remains with the nest producing more offspring.\nDuring the spring and summer, the \r\nnest may enlarge to 6-to-8 inches in diameter with several dozen wasps. In early \r\nfall, the colony begins to produce males and special reproductive female wasps. \r\nThese reproductive females, which constitute next year\u2019s queens, mate with males \r\nand soon leave the nest in search of protected spots in which they spend the \r\nwinter. The remaining worker wasps eventually die and the nest becomes vacant. \r\nPaper wasps will not reuse their nests the next year.\nWasps chew with their mouthparts. \r\nOccasionally parts are chewed from live plant stems which can cause some plant \r\ndamage. Also, paper wasps chew wood fiber from posts and other exposed wood.\nRemember, paper wasps are actually \r\nbeneficial insects because they prey on other insects that we consider pests of \r\nthe shrubs and flowers around our homes. If a nest is located where it is out of \r\nthe way and not likely to be disturbed, homeowners should consider leaving it \r\nalone. If, however, a nest is located in a \u201chigh traffic\u201d area such as along \r\nwalks or near doorways or in areas where children play, control is justified to \r\nreduce the threat of being stung. One control option is the use of insecticides \r\nformulated in pressurized containers that emit a narrow stream of spray from a \r\ndistance of 15-to-20 feet from a nest.\nIf a person is ever stung and \r\nexperiences difficulty breathing, they are having an allergic reaction and \r\nshould seek emergency medical treatment immediately. As Master Gardener \r\nvolunteers, we must always caution individuals who are especially sensitive to \r\nstings to consider obtaining the services of a reputable, licensed, professional \r\npest control operator who has the experience, equipment and most effective \r\ninsecticides to get the best job done.\n\n\n\n\nBeneficials \r\nin the Garden & Landscape is an\r\n\n\n\nEarth-KindTM \nprogram \r\ncoordinated through Extension Horticulture at Texas A&M University.

A solitary queen emerges from hibernation in the early spring and builds a small nest using chewed wood pulp. She raises the first generation of workers on her own. After they emerge, these workers collect food while the queen restricts herself to laying eggs. The larvae are fed pre-chewed caterpillars caught by adults, while the adults feed on nectar. Nests are typically small, usually a few dozen workers, but may contain as many as 100 workers. As fall approaches, colonies produce males and new queens, which leave the nest to mate. After mating, the new queens burrow into the ground where they spend the winter. All workers, the males, and the old queen perish around November. The same nest is not used again.\nDamage: These wasps are aggressive and will defend their nest if provoked. They deliver a painful sting. Their nests do not cause structural damage to buildings.\nBenefits: These insects are voracious predators of several residential and agricultural pests. They are especially valuable near vegetable gardens, where they provide natural and free control of herbivorous caterpillars. \nManagement: If the wasps are present in an area where they will not bother people, it is best to leave them. They will be gone after the first frost; and, in the meantime, they will reduce the populations of local pest species. They do not present a danger unless the nest is disturbed, and they will not return to the same nesting site the following year. \n\r\nIf control is necessary, use an approved \"Wasp & Hornet\" spray that propels a stream of insecticide 15-25 feet. Treatment is most effective in the evening when the majority of the insects are on the nest. Be sure to dress appropriately. Wear eye protection, a long-sleeved shirt, long pants and boots, and secure your sleeves and pant legs. Establish an unobstructed escape route and be ready to move quickly away from the area in case any of the insects fly towards you. Stand a safe distance from the nest and slowly approach while spraying with a sweeping motion (follow specific directions of the insecticide). If you require illumination, use a flashlight covered with red cellophane for a light - wasps cannot see red. You may need to repeat the treatment on two or three consecutive evenings. You may want to call in a professional, as there is a risk of being stung.\nSting: If a paper wasp approaches you, slowly raise your hands to your face and walk away. Remain calm! Avoid swatting at the wasp or running, as quick movements may elicit an attack. If possible, avoid the use of scented perfumes and soaps, and wear gray, white or tan to reduce the chances of a wasp approaching you. Unlike the honey bee, paper wasps have a smooth stinger and can sting more than once. If you are stung, cooling the area with ice may be soothing.\nRemember! Insect stings can elicit a life-threatening, allergic reaction in some individuals. Check with your physician to determine what symptoms require a visit to the emergency room. Never attempt any control measure if you have a known allergy to insect stings.\nFurther sources: Turillazzi, S. and M.J.West-Eberhard. 2002. Natural History and Evolution of Paper Wasps.

If paper wasps have built their nest near your front door or by an area where people frequently spend time, then you must remove the nest to prevent the wasps from attacking. You must take special precautions to make certain that you are not stung while you remove the nest, as multiple stings from these wasps could be fatal.\nChoose a commercial insecticide spray formulated to kill wasps. An aerosol spray that specifically indicates it is effective against wasps is ideal.\nFlashlights and lamps may rouse the wasps. If you want to have some light while you spray the paper wasp nest, put some red cellophane over the lens of your flashlight as a filter.\nDo not give angry wasps the opportunity to come into your house. Close all of the windows and doors near the paper wasp nest. This can also prevent unpleasant fumes permeating from the spray from wafting into a room.\nSpray the nest in the evening or at night when the wasps are all bedded down in the nest and less active. Do not stand directly underneath the paper wasp nest; otherwise, wasps may fall out of the nest and onto you -- and the spray may drip onto your skin or into your eyes. Coat the nest, and soak all of its cells completely with the wasp spray.\nIt is possible that wasps return to the nest the following day. Some wasps may have survived your spray. Watch during the day, and see whether any wasps are still flying in and out of the nest. Just to be safe, you should consider spraying the nest again once or twice before you attempt to remove the nest.\nBefore you remove the paper wasp nest, get a bag big enough to contain the nest. Ideally, this bag should seal shut, but a garbage bag with a twist tie can also do the job.\nChoose clothing, gloves and footwear that covers your skin and protects you as much as possible. There is still the possibility that a few live wasps may lurk around the nest, and any remaining wasp spray residue on the nest may irritate your skin.\nUse a broom, a rake or another tool with a long handle to knock down the paper wasp nest. You may find it easier to stand on a ladder, so you can approach the height of the nest before detaching it.\nPut the nest in the bag, and seal the bag shut. You can safely dispose of the sealed bag in your garbage bin.\nRemoving a paper wasp nest requires a lot of care. You must make absolutely certain that no live wasps remain in the nest, but you must also use your wasp spray safely. Once the wasps are thoroughly deceased, you are likely to find that the actual act of removing their nest is relatively simple.\n\nPlease login to add comments\n"], ["Are Paper Wasps Harmful? - Insects.Answers.com", "http://insects.answers.com/bees/are-paper-wasps-harmful-", "The term paper wasp can actually refer to several species of insect, but they generally exhibit similar behavior and can be treated in the same way.  When people think of wasps, they generally think of painful stings and swarms of buzzing pests.  Does the same apply to the paper wasp, and is the paper wasp a dangerous creature?\nScientifically speaking, paper wasps are members of the Polistinae family, but many people call yellow jackets and other hornet species paper wasps as well. Paper wasps are social insects that build nests out of plant fibers. The finished nests resemble brown paper, hence the name. The wasps build these nests in trees or under the roofs of houses to shelter them from rain.\nGenerally, paper wasps do not cause property damage.  Unlike termites, they do not harvest materials for their nests from artificial structures and do not cause damage to homes.  However, the nests can be unsightly, and many people remove them because of that.\nMost wasp infestations can be removed without the need of professional aid.  You can buy wasp killing sprays from several stores (or online).  Simply spray the nest, and wait until the wasps are dead; then remove the nest.  If there is a severe infestation, or if you are allergic (or don't wish to risk being stung), a professional exterminator can easily get rid of paper wasps.\nPaper wasps are not aggressive and only sting to defend their nests.  Their stings can be quite painful but are not lethal to humans - with one exception.  Certain individuals experience a lethal allergic reaction known as anaphylactic shock, which causes the airways to close. These individuals should seek medical attention immediately if stung.  Removal of paper wasp nests would also be a high priority for such people.\nPaper wasps are mainly pests.  Their nests are unattractive, and the tendency of the wasps to defend their territory can be annoying.  Only those individuals allergic to their stings are in severe danger; however, removal of paper wasp nests is a simple task, and these insects should not pose much of a problem.  In a worst case scenario, a professional exterminator can be called to deal with them.\n\nPlease login to add comments\n"], ["European Paper Wasp - Colorado State University Extension", "http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/insect/05611.html", "by W. Cranshaw1 (6/13)\nThe European paper wasp, Polistes dominula, is a newly established insect now abundant in many areas of Colorado. The paper nests of this wasp are commonly observed in yards and gardens and the wasp is involved in stinging incidents. The European paper wasp develops as a predator of caterpillars and some other insects, populations of which have probably been affected by the establishment of this new wasp.\nThe European paper wasp is a generally black insect marked with yellow. They are fairly slender-bodied insects with a distinct constriction of the body between the thorax and abdomen.\nThe European paper wasp is superficially similar to and commonly mistaken for various yellowjackets (Vespula spp.). Several yellowjacket species are native to Colorado and these historically have been the most significant stinging insects of the region. A somewhat blunter, more compact body form distinguishes yellowjackets from the European paper wasp. Also, \r\n the long hind legs of paper wasps tend to trail below when the insects are in flight. \nThe European paper wasp is the common paper wasp of Europe. It was first found in North America in the 1970s in the Boston area. Since then it has spread rapidly to much of the northern half of the United States and British Columbia. The first Colorado record for the species is August, 2001 from Larimer County, and it likely entered eastern Colorado shortly  before 2000. The first Utah record dates from 1995, suggest western Colorado may have been colonized earlier. Wherever it has established, the European paper wasp has usually become a common species within a few years. Currently it is now considered very abundant in every urbanized county in eastern Colorado and the three western Colorado counties of Mesa, Montrose, and \r\n Delta. Presently it is not thought to occur in much of the higher elevation counties, but is known in Steamboat Springs.\nThe European paper wasp is a social insect that produces an annual colony in a paper nest. Individual colonies are established anew each spring.  The overwintering stage are females (queens), only slightly larger than the wasps typically observed during summer. Female wasps that were fertilized the previous fall survive winter in protected sites in and around a yard.  When they emerge from overwintering shelters, they may be seen on warm days as they seek sites to establish new nests. Earliest activity is sometimes seen in the first half of March.\nNests are constructed of paper, produced from chewed wood fibers of weathered fences, porch decks and similar sites. Initially, a few hexagonal paper cells are formed and eggs laid in the cells. Upon hatch, the wasp larvae are fed crushed insects, usually caterpillars, that the overwintered queen discovers in foraging trips among nearby plants. When full grown the larvae then seal over the cell and pupate. Development of the wasps to the adult form is usually completed in 3 to 4 weeks after eggs are laid. The new wasps assist in colony activities of nest construction, foraging, and caring for young. The original queen increasingly remains restricted to the nest as new workers take over colony activities.\nThe colony continues to grow through the summer and may contain several dozen individuals by the end of summer. The nest is continuously expanded and reconstructed through the summer and may contain a hundred or more cells by fall. A few of the wasps produced later in summer are males and increasing numbers of the females become sexually mature at that same time. Mating occurs and the mated females are the surviving overwintering stage. Males and non-reproductive females do not survive winter and the nest is abandoned by late fall.\nThe fertilized overwintering females seek protected sites for shelter during the cold season. Often they find winter shelter outdoors but occasionally they will find suitable areas behind walls or in other areas of the house. These wasps sometimes will move about during warm periods and may find themselves within the living space. Such wintertime encounters do not indicate the presence of an active nest, only that some wasps have found some pocket of winter shelter within the building. Overwintered females emerge from these areas in spring and search out sites to establish nests in the neighborhood.\nNests are almost always established in new locations each year and several kinds of nest sites are particularly favored. (New nests sometimes are established at the same site the following year.) Dark cavities are often used, including those found in outdoor grills, large bells, pipes, rock cavities, and hollow spaces behind walls. Nests are also commonly attached \r\n to wood on the underside of porch decks, eaves of homes or other overhangs. Nests are almost always attached to either wood, roughened metal surfaces, or rock.\nPaper wasp nests are not covered with a surrounding envelope of paper. Paper envelopes that surround a nest are characteristic of yellowjackets (Vespula spp.) and hornets (Dolichovespula spp.), the other social wasps found in Colorado. Yellowjackets nest underground or, occasionally, behind walls; hornets make conspicuous football-sized nests attached to branches or under eaves. \nThe European paper wasp is capable of stinging. Among the stinging insects found in the state European paper wasp is relatively non-aggressive, and somewhat less likely to sting than are most yellowjackets and bumble bees. Stings from European paper wasp occur almost exclusively when nests are accidentally disturbed.\nEuropean paper wasps rear their young on live insects. They do not produce nuisance problems around outdoor dining that characterize scavenging species, such as the western yellowjacket. European paper wasps will sometimes feed on sweet materials, including honeydew produced by aphids. On rare occasions, they also may feed and damage ripe fruit. This habit is particularly notable in cherries and some other well-ripened stone fruits grown on the West Slope, where they may be serious pests.\nEuropean paper wasps have become one of the most important natural controls of many kinds of yard and garden insects. Most commonly they feed on caterpillars, including the larvae of hornworms, cabbageworms, and tent caterpillars. Sawfly larvae are also commonly taken prey.\n(European paper wasps can be encouraged to nest in nest boxes. Artificial nest sites can be useful if one wants the benefits of these insects with a known nest location so accidental disturbances can be avoided. A typical nest box would be made of wood and at least 4-in x 4-in x 4-in, open at the bottom. They should be mounted several feet above ground on a solid post.)\nIf nests are not in a location where they are likely to be disturbed, it is usually best to leave them in place. The nests will be abandoned at the end of the season and they then can be safely removed.\nIndividual nests can be destroyed. Insecticides are often used for this purpose and a wide variety of \u0093wasp and hornet\u0094 marketed products are effective. If nests are treated it is recommended to apply treatments in the evening. At this time most of the wasps have returned to the nest so that they can be killed and, after dark, flying activities are greatly reduced. \nAfter the nest has been killed it should be removed and destroyed. This will eliminate larvae that were within capped cells during spraying. These usually survive and later will emerge. It is also recommended that after a nest is removed the area also be washed with a jet of water to eliminate colony odors. These practices will inhibit surviving wasps, not present \r\n on the nest when it was destroyed, from attempting to reestablish a nest upon return.\nThere are no traps or lures that can be used to control this species. Commercially available \u0091wasp traps\u0092 are designed to attract certain kinds of yellowjackets and contain baits such as fruit juices, fresh meat, or heptyl butyrate (found in many retail wasp lures). None of these are attractive to the European paper wasp. There has not         been any type of trap identified as effective for this species. (Large numbers of the native western yellowjacket, Vespula pensylvanica, and prairie yellowjacket, V. atripilosa, are captured by these traps.)\nThree other species of paper wasps are native to the state\u0097Polistes fuscatus (golden paper wasp), Polistes apachus and Mischocytarssus flavitarsus (western paper wasp). There is no evidence that the new species has significantly affected their activities. In rural areas, away from buildings and human structures, these native paper wasps are the predominant species of paper wasp one will likely find. All of these other paper wasps have generally similar biologies to the European paper wasp.\n *W.

Like many other social wasps, paper wasps feed on many insect pests of gardens. Unfortunately, paper wasps will also feed on fruits, damaging their appearance and will scrape wood from houses to make their nests. Though they are not aggressive, paper wasps can sting, making them a concern to many people when these wasps build their nests in or around homes.\nThere are many different types of paper wasps with different habits and life cycles. The most common paper wasps are about 5/8 to 3/4 inch in length. Many are brownish with yellow markings, though a few species have reddish markings. \nDuring the winter, most paper wasps die, except new queens. Queens survive the winter by nesting in protected places such as under the bark of trees, or in cracks and crevices around structures. In the spring, several queens commonly get together to start a new nest. Eventually, one queen will dominate the others, making them serve as workers for the new colony. \nBy scraping and chewing wood into a pasty pulp, paper wasps make\u00a0 paper-like nests in the shape of an umbrella. These nests are built in protected locations including in shrubs, on tree branches, on porch ceilings, window and door frames, roof overhangs, attic rafters, and under decks, joists or railings. The queen deposits eggs in the comb (cells) on the underside of the nest. After the eggs hatch, the\u00a0 grub-like immatures are mostly fed other insects, such as caterpillars, that the worker wasps collect. Once the larvae have matured, they pupate in their cells and join the colony as an adult. Adult paper wasps mainly feed on nectar. \nThough paper wasps do not readily attack people, they will sting if they feel threatened or provoked. Many times people are stung when they bumble into paper wasp nests hidden in bushes or around homes.\nSince most paper wasps die by the first hard frost, workers found late in the year may not require treatment. Most nests in natural areas away from structures should be left alone to allow the wasps to feed on garden pests. If several wasps are seen flying in one area around your home, inspect the area for the protected places these wasps like to build nests. Remember that some nests may be hidden from views such as in an attic, under a deck rail or porch floor. If the nest is found, spray it directly with an aerosol insecticide labeled for wasp and hornet control. There are many products available at home centers and retail stores. Use a product that can spray up to 20 feet and\u00a0 provides quick knock-down and kill of the wasps. Treat in the early evening hours when all the wasps are on the nest. Do not use a flashlight to illuminate the nest as the wasps could be attracted to the light. Do not stand directly under the nest when you are treating. Wear protective clothing including a long sleeved, collared shirt, long pants, shoes, socks and a hat at a minimum. \nRemove the nest after the wasps are killed to discourage future paper wasp nests. If new paper wasp colonies continue nesting in the same areas around your home, consider making alterations. For example, if wasps are nesting in attic areas or other voids, exclude them by screening any openings or vents. On exterior surfaces, a fresh coat of paint or varnish will make it difficult for the wasps to attach their nests to the slick surface. Finally, keep bushes well trimmed and properly thinned to discourage paper wasps from nesting on inner branches.\u00a0 "], ["European Paper Wasp \u2014 Entomology \u2014 Penn State ...", "http://ento.psu.edu/extension/factsheets/dominulus-or-european-paper-wasp", "\nSkip to content\nSkip to navigation\n\n\r\n Before 1981, the European paper wasp was not recorded in North America. In its native region,\r\n \r\n  P. dominula\r\n \r\n is the most abundant paper wasp in those countries around the Mediterranean. It is also found in southern Europe, northern Africa, the Middle East, and eastward into China.\n\r\n A highly successful colonizer, this wasp has rapidly increased its distribution in the United States during the past 20 years. Before the introduction of this new species, the northern paper wasp,\r\n \r\n  Polistes fuscatus\r\n \r\n , was the most frequently encountered species in and around structures in Pennsylvania.\n\n\r\n Image 1.\r\n \r\n  P. dominula\r\n \r\n Steve Jacobs - Penn State\r\n   \r\n   Entomology Dept.\n\n\r\n  P. dominula\r\n \r\n is frequently mistaken for a yellowjacket. Smaller than the native northern paper wasp, the European paper wasp (Images. 1 & 2) is yellow and black, resembling the pattern (especially on the abdomen) of the yellowjackets in the genus Vespula.\n\r\n As in all paper wasps, the \u201cwaist\u201d is very thin. During flight, the hind pair of legs trail below in an extended fashion. The nest is the characteristic upside-down umbrella shape, and the open cells can be seen from below. Cream-colored larvae are legless and remain within their cells until they emerge as adult wasps.\n\n\n Image 2.\r\n \r\n  P. dominula\r\n \r\n on nest.\r\n   \r\n   Steve Jacobs - Penn State\r\n   \r\n   Entomology Dept.\n\n\r\n  P. dominula\r\n \r\n was first discovered near Boston, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, during the late 1970s. Since then, the wasp has been recorded from Maine, Vermont, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Michigan. It has recently been discovered in California and Washington.\n\r\n Fertilized queens from the previous year begin new colonies of\r\n \r\n  P. dominula\r\n \r\n each spring. These queens overwinter in protected areas such as under the bark of dead trees, in hollow trees, within wall voids of houses, under siding and occasionally within the cells of a paper wasp nest. Although most nests are newly constructed each year, the queens will sometimes use a previous year\u2019s nest, thereby establishing their colonies earlier in the season than our native species.\n\r\n The queen deposits small, elongated eggs (one to a cell) that hatch in several days. She will feed her young larvae masticated caterpillars and other insects. In contrast, our native species of\r\n \r\n  Polistes\r\n \r\n prey only on caterpillars. After the first brood of larvae mature and emerge as worker females, the queen will limit her activity to laying eggs to expand the number of workers. The workers assume the duties of food collection, nest construction, and colony defense. With optimal temperatures and a plentiful food source, the larvae complete their development and become adult wasps in as little as 40 days.\n\r\n Nests are constructed in protected locations such as under and within the eaves of structures, in attics and wall voids, and in many other enclosed areas. Some of the more notable locations where nests have been encountered include exterior lighting fixtures, parking meters, animal skulls, bird boxes, and infrequently used equipment like gas grills, motor homes, boats, and autos.\n\r\n Speculations for the rapid expansion of the European paper wasp include:\n\r\n European paper wasps are very attentive to potential threats to their nests. They can detect movement at 12 to 20 feet from the nest but fortunately do not typically attack unless people are very close (inches away). However, since they prefer to hide their nests within voids and other enclosures, this behavior increases the risk for unpleasant encounters. An unsuspecting homeowner may be stung, for instance, while attempting to change a lightbulb for an outside fixture, or while painting or removing window shutters. Furthermore, observations in Pennsylvania indicate that these wasps are extremely common in urban settings.\n\r\n Whenever new species are introduced into an environment (either intentionally or accidentally), there are unpredictable consequences. The increased risk for stings is an obvious concern. Even more troubling, it appears that this new introduction has had an adverse impact on the native species of\r\n \r\n  Polistes\r\n \r\n . The apparent reduction of indigenous Polistes will undoubtedly result in a change in the faunal balance. It is unclear what the consequences will be. Some entomologists worry that the large numbers of\r\n \r\n  P. dominula\r\n \r\n will adversely affect the species of desirable insects (i.e., butterflies).\n\r\n Every attempt should be made to limit suitable nest sites. Repair holes in walls, caulk cracks in soffits and eaves, and screen vents and louvers. Nests made early in the season by founding queens are easier to eliminate before workers are produced. During this period it is easy to knock down exposed nests and kill the queen. Nests that have several workers can be treated with a wasp and hornet spray. These sprays produce a stream of insecticides that can shoot up to 20 feet from the nozzle. Treatments should be made at night when all the workers and the queen are on the nest. Those nests located within eaves and soffits can be treated by applying an insecticidal dust to the openings of the voids. Blow the dust into the opening, taking care not to breathe dust that becomes airborne. Select a dust that is labeled for this type of application. Appropriate dusters available include bulb dusters and plunger or pump dusters. Pest control firms also provide services to control paper wasps.\n\r\n Pesticides are poisonous. Read and follow directions and safety precautions on labels. Handle carefully and store in original labeled containers out of the reach of children, pets, and livestock. Dispose of empty containers right away, in a safe manner and place. Do not contaminate forage, streams, or ponds.\n\n\r\n  Authored by: Steve Jacobs, Sr. Extension Associate\r\n \n\n\r\n  March 2002\r\n    \r\n    Revised November 2011\r\n \nPenn State College of Agricultural Sciences research, extension, and resident education programs are funded in part by Pennsylvania counties, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\nVisit Penn State Extension on the web: http://extension.psu.edu\n\nWhere trade names appear, no discrimination is intended, and no endorsement by Penn State Cooperative Extension is implied.\nThis publication is available in alternative media on request.\nPenn State is an equal opportunity, affirmative action employer, and is committed to providing employment opportunities to minorities, women, veterans, individuals with disabilities, and other protected groups.

Yellowjackets are small\nyellow and black wasps which are sometimes loosely defined as\nyellow and black hornets.  The American species traditionally\nknown as hornets is primarily black with black and white\nabdomens.  The European hornet is a large yellow and brown wasp.\nPaper wasps are characteristically long-legged, reddish or brown\nto almost black insects with slender, spindle-shaped abdomens.\nEgg -- Wasp eggs are small, white and sausage-shaped.\nLarva -- Wasp larvae are legless white or cream grubs with\npale to dark brown heads.  Larvae of most species are at least 14\nmm long when fully grown.\nPupa -- Pupae are slightly shorter than mature larvae and\ndevelop within silken cocoons in cells within the nest.\n\nBIOLOGY\nDistribution -- Hornets, yellowjackets, and paper wasps\noccur throughout most temperate areas of the world.\nHosts -- These wasps prey on many types of insects,\nparticularly caterpillars, although hornets and yellowjackets are\nalso attracted to meat and sweet drinks.\nDamage -- Because they prey on many harmful insects, these\nwasps actually perform a beneficial function.  However, when they\nnest in lawns, yard trees and eaves of houses, wasps may\ninterfere with outdoor activities.  Wasps are likely to sting\nanyone who disturbs their nest.  Paper wasps, however, tend to be\nless aggressive than hornets and yellowjackets.  Wasp stings are\npainful and cause severe allergic reactions in some people.\nLife History -- The nests of hornets, yellowjackets and\npaper wasps are abandoned each year.  In fall, virgin queens and\nmales leave the nests and mate.  The males and workers eventually\ndie, but the queens overwinter in rock cracks, under bark, in\nhouses or underground.  In spring, queens emerge and begin\nbuilding nests.  Hornet nests are usually constructed above\nground in trees or shrubs; whereas those of yellowjackets are\nusually constructed underground.  The European hornet usually\nconstructs nests in hollow trees.  Paper wasps make papery,\nhoneycomb-like nests usually located above ground in trees and\ndense shrubbery, under eaves, or some sheltered area.\n \nAfter constructing a small nest, the queen lays a single egg in\neach cell of the comb.  Two to 3 days later, the eggs hatch and\nthe queen begins to feed masticated insects to the larvae.\nWithin 12 to 18 days, the larvae mature.  Fully grown larvae spin\nsilken caps over their cells and pupate.  About 12 days later,\nnew adult workers emerge.  These workers attend and feed larvae\nthat develop subsequently, enlarge nests, and under some\ncircumstances (e.g., death of queen), lay male eggs.  After\nraising the first brood of workers, the queen remains in the nest\nand deposits eggs.  Hornet and yellowjacket queens produce about\n1500 eggs; paper wasp queens may lay several hundred during their\nlifetime.\n\nCONTROL\n \nIn spring or summer, control of wasps may be warranted.\nTreatment should be done at night when the wasps are quiet.

Yates III\nExtension Urban Entomologist\nCollege of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources\nUniversity of Hawaii at Manoa\nHOSTS\nWasps are commonly seen around homes, feeding on other insect\r\npests, especially caterpillars; in this respect they can be\r\nconsidered beneficial. Their diet also includes meat, plant and\r\nfruit juices, and honeydew, and one may observe them drinking\r\nwater from a leaky faucet, puddle or other source. In\r\nrecreational areas, they will forage in rubbish cannisters.\nDISTRIBUTION\nWorldwide\nDAMAGE\nInflicts a potent sting.\nBIOLOGY\nPaper wasps are often mistaken for a close relative, the\r\nyellowjacket wasp. The paper wasp abdomen is spindle-shaped and\r\ntapers at both ends, whereas the yellowjacket abdomen is broad at\r\nboth ends, similar to that of the honey bee. Paper wasps are\r\nslender in appearance and are approximately 8.6 cm long;\r\nyellowjackets are robust and are about 1.3 cm in length. \nPaper wasps are social insects, since individuals of the same\r\nspecies cooperate in caring for the young, labor is divided\r\nbetween reproductives and workers, and generations overlap in\r\nsuch a way that offspring assist their parents in contributing to\r\ncolony labor. The paper wasp nest is open-faced, single-layered,\r\nand shaped like an inverted umbrella. These nests are constructed\r\nabove ground and can be found hanging from eaves, branches of\r\ntrees and shrubs, flowering plants, garage ceilings, fences,\r\nattics of homes, and other protected areas. The nest material is\r\nmade up of a mixture of masticated wood and the salivary\r\nsecretions of the female wasps. The nest is started by a mated\r\nfemale queen wasp who builds a small number of cells and into\r\nwhich she deposits an egg. The eggs will hatch and the emerging\r\nlarvae will continue to develop and grow within the cell. The\r\nqueen will forage for food outside the nest and bring back the\r\nfood to the growing larvae until such time as pupation occurs.\r\nAll emerging adults will be female workers with undeveloped\r\nreproductive organs. These new female workers will then assume\r\nthe responsibility of the feeding of all other larvae and further\r\nconstruction of the nest, while the queen will then devote all\r\nher time to egg-laying. Paper wasps' nests seldom exceed 200\r\ninsects. Duration of a colony can be for approximately six to\r\nseven months and is primarily dependent upon the reproductive\r\ncapacity of the queen.\nEGGS\nNo hatching data are available for P. exclamans, but\r\nbased on data for paper wasps in similar tropical areas, the eggs\r\nare presumed to hatch in about two weeks.\nLARVAE\nFed insects (caterpillars, etc.) and nectar by the queen.\r\nThese larvae transform into adults in about two months from the\r\ntime of egg laying.\nPUPAE\nThe pupal period is approximately two weeks.\nADULTS\nMales and sterile females assume the function of workers to\r\nmaintain the colony. With this support, the queen becomes an\r\negg-laying entity.\nMANAGEMENT\nControl methods for paper wasps should be directed at the\r\nnest, not at the foraging adults. Mechanical destruction of the\r\nnest can be dangerous, since such activity will aggravate adults,\r\noften causing them to pursue and sting anyone nearby. Stings have\r\nbeen reported to be painful, and if one is allergic to insect\r\nvenoms, medical attention should be sought immediately.\nNON-CHEMICAL CONTROL\nTwo larval parasites of paper wasps have been recorded in\r\nHawaii: Pachysomodes stupidus (Cresson) (Hymenoptera:\r\nIchneumonidae) was reported from P. exclamans larvae in\r\nSeptember 1970; Elamus polistis Burks (Hymenoptera:\r\nElasmidae) was recovered from Polistis sp. in December\r\n1986. Literature lists P. exclamans and P. fuscatus as\r\nlarval hosts.\nCHEMICAL CONTROL\nMost pesticides that are effective against bees will also give\r\ngood control of wasps. Although insecticidal dusts are effective,\r\napplying them to paper wasp nests can be cumbersome without the\r\nproper equipment and safety apparel and because of the nest\r\nlocation. Dusts can also irritate the adults. If the dust has\r\nbeen successfully applied, kill can be expected within 24 hours.\r\nAerosol sprays are also available. These devices are capable of\r\nreaching nests 20 feet away. When all adults have been killed,\r\nthe nest should be knocked down and disposed of to prevent its\r\nreuse by other wasps, since insecticidal dusts may remain\r\neffective for only a few weeks.\nAny insecticide or formulation should be applied in the early\r\nmorning or evening when adult wasps are gathered on the nest and\r\nare less active.\nREFERENCES\nEvans, H.

"""This is a fourth pass at gauging pain intensity from google search results,
and the first one I would say is truly successful. 

Here we explore a more careful choice of relevant features.
As before, we use a regression on search results for each insect.
But now we focus only on the words near "painful" in search results.
The nearby words are likely to modify "painful" and thus give a sharper sense
of *how* painful.

Previous approaches have suffered from "kitchen sink" feature sets,
and I could see that the algorithms were putting high weight on garbage
features. My intuition was being driven by spam classification algs,
where there may be 10,000+ features. But here, this is not a good approach.

The primary issue, I think, is that we don't have enough data for that approach.
I used to think that regularization was the panacea to overfitting,
but think about what's going on here.
Adding tons of features makes it easy to overfit. We can rein this
in by regularizing with ridge or lasso. But what does ridge do?
It squashes everything down towards zero, promoting a spread
of weight across all the words. This prevents us from cherry-picking 
the particular features that best fit the training data and giving them
super-high weight, but it does NOT magically help us to find the features
that best generalize outside the training data. With so many features and so few
data points, the algorithm is still bound to identify ungeneralizable words
as most important because they happen to fit the training data best. 
The fact that their coeffs get squashed down is at best a dilution, not a
solution, to the problem.
Lasso regression has the same problem. It will pick a few words and call them
most important, but they are unlikely to be the right words.

The solution is to help our algorithm out by reducing noise in the set of words
before we even get started. 
This is accomplished by focusing only on the words near "painful".

In addition, we can restrict our feature set to use only the k most common
words across the data. We can experiment with choice of k, and perhaps 
do something like ruling out short words. I have tried restricting only to stems
of at least 4 letters, which works fine but more experimentation is needed.

*

PROCEDURE:
We essentially reduce each search result to the nearby text and then
perform the same exercise as in agg_regression_analysis.py.

y = pain intensity of the corresponding bug
X = vector of word frequencies in the result, for each of the 
    most common words across dataset, normalized by number of results.


As a motivating example, here are some actual search results for
 "lionfish" "painful":

"How to treat a lionfish sting and administer first aid treatment in the event 
of ... For most people the throbbing, intense pain is going to last for a few 
hours and will ..."

"Although not fatal, the sting of a lionfish is extremely painful. 
Because these fish are not aggressive toward people, contact and poisoning is 
usually accidental."

^We see words like "intense" and "throbbing." This is much more focused than
the surrounding text.

*

I have also incorporated the ability to make predictions for arbitrary inputs.
This lets me evaluate performance loosely, outside the training set.
This is important because the training set consists of pains within a narrow
domain, namely sting pain from hymenopterans.

The very first pass does NOT do well on external sources of pain.
One reason is that the sting pain results use words like 'sting',
which itself gets a high coeff of 0.89. That's bad, because in the 
training context it is largely a constant term, but outside this context 
it is not usually present. So this alone represents a handicap of -0.89
applied to non-sting pain. 

For instance, we might expect the black widow spider to do relatively well.
Is it not also a bug? Yet it does not sting -- it bites.
The alg is giving it an estimated intensity of 0.88, systematically lower
than ALL predictions in training/test data, presumably because it lacks
many of the common words that incidentally occur around stinging insects.

When I read about the black widow bite, I can certainly tell that it's 
very painful, so in principle this is a fixable problem.
Upon closer inspection, we may also be having issues due to the fact that
the qualitative *type* of pain is different. Latrodectism is characterized
by muscle cramps etc, which don't show up much in the hymenopteran data.


One solution is to simply broaden the scope of the training set, which
is sort of the point of the website. Another solution is to carefully 
remove these types of words from consideration.

A third option is to re-weight the words, so that words common to many
bugs across the scale are given little weight. Unimportant words should not
be allowed to leach magnitude from the constant term.
We are using a bag-of-words approach here, and should
look into tf-idf:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf

Other comments:
* I think it's pretty clear that Ridge is the right choice here. There are 
quite a few words with predictive power, not just a few crucial ones.
I tried lasso just to see, and it really didn't do well.

Things to try:
* Use tf-idf
* See what's going on with the intercept
* Try using higher order features and/or bigrams.

Actually, I don't see what tf-idf would accomplish given that we're running
a regression. Well, it's a way of normalizing features, which wouldn't matter
for straight OLS, but given that we're regularizing with ridge regression,
it would matter. But why not just set normalize=True for Ridge?

I tried that and...well, it completely changed everything. 
The highest weighted words are no longer "sting" etc, but...they don't exactly
make sense either. passag, part, stock, account, steve, gun. Right...
Think about if there is any advantage to reweighting words. There really
ought to be. Each word should be on equal footing for regularization purposes.

Next, I tried simply removing highly rated words like 'sting' and 'insect'
which are obviously specific to insect sting pain. This helped a bit,
but it's more of a demo than an actual solution. 

In straight OLS, the coeff on sting should reflect its residual predictive power
over and above the other terms, including the constant. So if this got a positive
beta in OLS, it would indicate that more mention of "sting" actually 
coincides with higher pain insects. But if possible, we should deliberately 
deprive ourselves of this language for times when we are trying to apply
our model to non-stinging pains. It is still useful within this domain, but
we should project it out, more generally. So...think about the right projection
that would do that.

[Does sklearn's ridge regularization include the constant term as another feature? 
If so, then sting will pick up some of the constant term, 
which is an objectively terrible idea. The last thing we want is for a bunch
of words which are common across the domain of sting pain to displace the 
intercept coeff! Then when we move to a different problem domain, we effectively
lose the intercept, leveling everything down.
If ridge does it wrong, that's bad. The solution is NOT to add my own vector
of 1's, because that will DEFINITELY be regularized.
Ugh. The internet is being unhelpful on this front.
It looks like the intercept IS included in regularization.

]


Anyway, I need a more general way to rule out words like sting and insect.
The obvious approach is to actually expand
the training set. In the absence of this, though, I could try an exercise
where I restrict myself to only words used across both problem domains,
and then use the rated data to train.
This is using lionfish as training data in a first pass, but only schmidt
data to actually train.

I expect some version of this will lead to an improvement; however, there
is clearly no substitute for actual training. Different pain domains can 
use the same set of words in different ways to indicate pain.

Actually, ultimately I may want to make good use of domain-specific language
inside any domain, so long as I can identify the domain.
I'm starting to see where this leads. There is no single optimal translation
from written language into pain, but written language also contains other
clues about which translation we should use. I can identify differences
between writing about insects and fish, which means so can a learning algorithm.
We will ultimately want to perform
a clustering exercise to sort pain sources into different groups based
on the language used to describe them. We will then use the data within
the group to estimate pain. 

Oh, now this is interesting. Not to get ahead of myself, but this latter problem
is starting to take on aspects of recommender systems. The clustering approach
is simplistic and absolute: a pain gets sorted into a particular bucket, and is handled
like all the other pains in that bucket. But we could take a more nuanced
view of the world. Each pain is similar to others to various degrees. There is
an underlying vector of characteristics for each pain. One (set of) 
characteristics
is the intensity etc, another set of characteristics is the words used to describe
this class of pain sources, and a third set of characteristics is the words
used in this class of pain sources to actually describe the pain intensity.
We can use the second set to identify a class of pain, and the third set
to make the translation. But more generally, the second set may tell us not
just one class but rather how similar to each class. We can build up a
"personalized" translation table by taking a weighted combination of these
classes.

That's very vague and possibly rubbish, but something to think about down the
line.
